Bitcoin Difficulty Drops: Halving Making Miners Hesitant?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin difficulty has seen a drop in the latest network adjustment, suggesting the miners have stopped their expansion.
Bitcoin Difficulty Drops 1% As Hashrate Remains Flat
The “difficulty” is an in-built feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard the miners would find it to find blocks on the chain right now. This feature exists because the BTC blockchain intends to keep its “block production rate” at a constant rate.
The block production rate refers to the rate at which miners find blocks on the network. As compensation for solving these blocks, the miners receive block rewards.

These rewards serve as the only way to mint more of the cryptocurrency, so the rate at which they are given out equals the production rate of the cryptocurrency itself.
By nature, their BTC value remains fixed (except for during halvings), so the production rate of the asset is directly dependent on the speed at which miners can go through blocks.
When the miners increase their total computing power (known as the “hashrate“), they become faster at their task and produce blocks faster, thus raising the production rate of the asset.
This is problematic, however, as it means that these chain validators can go through the unmined supply faster and faster, and continuously flood the market with tokens.
Demand-supply dynamics would suggest that such inflation can be disastrous for the value of the asset. And indeed, Satoshi, the creator of the digital asset, recognized this issue.
As mentioned before, the difficulty exists to keep the block production rate constant. This is the solution Satoshi came up with: by controlling how hard miners would find it to mine blocks, the speed boost owing to greater computing power can be negated.
Approximately every 14 days, the network adjusts its difficulty based on the average block time that the blockchain has observed since the previous adjustment. The Bitcoin network aims to keep this value at around a standard rate of 10 mins per block.
The latest such adjustment has occurred during the past day and has resulted in a reduction of difficulty.

From the chart, it’s visible that although the Bitcoin difficulty has gone down, the reduction has only been slight: under 1%. This means that the average block time has recently been just a bit less than the 10 minutes per block target.
Earlier, the difficulty had been riding an uptrend and setting new all-time highs, as the miners had been constantly expanding their hashrate.

The indicator has declined a bit recently, though, which is why the difficulty has gone down. It’s unclear right now whether this means that the miners are putting their expansion on hold for now or not.
Next month, Bitcoin is set to see a big event that will drastically change the economics of mining: the halving. Halvings are periodic events coded into the BTC blockchain that permanently slash the block rewards in half.
These events go off after every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. The block rewards make up for the majority of the miners’ revenues, so these rewards being cut in half would naturally be quite significant for the miners’ bottom line.

It’s possible that some miners may not see it worth adding more hashrate now, as the halving may well make it unprofitable for them. Though, the bigger factor in the slowdown of the hashrate may be the fact that the BTC price has also slowed down since setting its new all-time high.
The block rewards obviously go up in value along with the BTC price, so a fresh uptrend in the coming days could encourage some miners to bet more and get new hashrate online, as it has always happened in history.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $70,800, up over 6% in the last seven days.

(Source: CoinGecko)South Korean Judges Make First Crypto Disclosures – the Details
A long-running scandal dubbed Coin Gate by the South Korean media broke last year. This initially centered on a lawmaker who reportedly sold coins after receiving insider information on forthcoming regulatory changes.Since then, the scope of the scandal has expanded to other lawmakers. It has also expanded to senior civil servants and leading judiciary members.This led the Supreme Court to rule that senior judges must make annual public declarations of their coin and other asset holdings to avoid possible conflicts of interest.Judges’ declarations must also include spouses’ holdings. They must also include details of wallets held in their children’s names.Cheongju District Court Chief Justice Lim Byeong-ryeol reported the most sizeable Bitcoin holdings. Lim and his family declared holding BTC 9.92, with BTC 3.38 in wallets under his name.Lim’s spouse and eldest son hold the remaining BTC 6.54 in wallets in their names.Lim’s spouse and son also reported holding smaller amounts of altcoins “such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP” in private wallets.Documents show that Seoul High Court Chief Justice Hwang Byeong-ha’s dependents also reported holding BTC 2.07.Another Seoul High Court Chief Judge, Kim Bok-hyung, revealed crypto holdings worth some $2,200.Meanwhile, Seoul Bankruptcy Court Chief Justice Ahn Byeong-wook and National Court Administration Deputy Director Bae Hyeong-won also revealed that wallets in their children’s name “also contained crypto holdings.”The children of Supreme Court Justices Roh Tae-ak, Kwon Young-jun, and Shin Sook-hee also reported that they own cryptoassets, Joongang Ilbo reported.Judges Hold Unlisted Stocks, Crypto, and Overseas Shares
Judges were also obliged to reveal their total assets, with data showing that several judges hold unlisted domestic stocks, as well as overseas stocks.Senior South Korean judges seemed particularly keen on blue-chip US stocks. Several declared holding shares in companies like Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia.Earlier this month, a South Korean law firm operator was sent to jail for stealing clients’ money to spend on private crypto investments.

Business Concerns Rising: DeFi Vulnerabilities and Scams Revealed in Q1 | Cryptopolitan

The first quarter of 2024 will see a crisis in the cryptocurrency market, with total losses reported due to hacks and fraud witnessed. $336.3 million loss.While this figure is indeed alarming, it also represents a slight decrease from the previous year and reflects both subtle and unmistakable changes in the economy.DeFi vulnerabilities reportDecentralized Finance (DeFi) systems have become a prime target for cybercriminals, causing massive financial losses in the cryptocurrency space. According to new findings, DeFi accounted for 100% of attacks detected in the first quarter, and centralized finance (CeFi) platforms completed such attacks during this period. The data shows higher risk associated with DeFi platforms, which despite their new status are still an attractive target for criminals.Two major events were effective in the financial losses in the quarter and accounted for 43% of all losses. The most important of these is the $81.7 million attack on the Orbit Bridge protocol used during the New Year’s celebration, which indicates the risk of hackers. This was driven by the $62 million breach of Blast-based NFT game Munchables; Here, in conversations with hackers, the stolen funds were recovered within 24 hours.There is a money chain in such cases: Seven crimes resulted in the success of $73.9 million, which is 22% of the money stolen. In addition, the total number of attacks decreased by 17.6% compared to the previous year, indicating that efforts to strengthen security measures will be effective.Combating hacking and fraudThe report explores the prevalence of various types of attacks in the business world; Hacking accounts for 95.6% of all losses across 46 cases, including financial attacks. impact of fraud, scams and claims (remaining 4.4%). This distribution highlights the importance of protecting technology from cyber threats!Ethereum has once again become the most targeted blockchain network, with more activity than the BNB chain. The losses shared by both networks underscore the ongoing need to improve security measures across all platforms. The report also identifies various blockchains affected by the attack, including Arbitrum, Solana, Optimism, Bitcoin, Blast, Polygon, Conflux Network and Base, and touches upon the extent of threat.Immunefi plays an important role in increasing the security of the crypto ecosystem. The platform has paid out more than $95 million in bounties, offering large sums of money to identify and resolve vulnerabilities, and claims to have protected more than $25 billion in user accounts across multiple platforms. Arrangements include Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix and MakerDAO. This effective security defense has become an essential part of the business’ strategy to defend against this ever-changing threat.ConclusionThe first quarter of 2024 has highlighted ongoing competition and changing threats when you first encounter cryptocurrency trading. While the reduction in overall losses and the success of large-scale thefts offer some hope, Immunefi’s report is an important reminder that security and collaboration urgently need to improve to prevent hackers and fraud. As the industry continues to expand and innovate, a collective commitment to protecting the ecosystem to ensure trust and security for all participants is vital.

Driving Cats NFT Club Pre-Sale - Should You Buy DCNC Instead of SHIB, DOGE or PEPE?



                    
The Driving Cats NFT Club pre-sale will be available to all members of the public, and it will get underway at 8:30 AM (GMT) on 29 March.



Many crypto investors have been pouring money into altcoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepecoin (PEPE) in search of higher gains than what they’re likely to achieve holding Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).




While these altcoins can deliver significant returns in the next bull run – potentially over 200% – investing in NFTs during a pre-sale can potentially generate even higher returns, in a much shorter period of time.



One such opportunity that is emerging is the Driving Cats NFT Club (DCNC.)



The pre-sale for the Driving Cats NFT Club will be available to all members of the public, and it will get underway at 8:30 AM (GMT) on 29 March via OpenSea.io.




During the pre-sale, each of the 999 NFTs that make up this collection will be available to buy for just 0.07 ETH (around $240).



Once the public sale starts in mid-April, each NFT will be priced at 0.25 ETH – over four times its price during the pre-sale.



However, as the NFT collection is expected to sell out during the pre-sale, and as most buyers will likely hold onto their NFTs rather than trying to flip them in the secondary market, the price of each NFT could rally much higher than 0.25 ETH.



For early buyers, the Driving Cats NFT Club could be a great investment, potentially delivering much higher returns than if you were to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepecoin (PEPE), Bitcoin (BTC), or Ethereum (ETH.)

Crypto ATMs to resurge once Bitcoin ‘FOMO’ hits full swing, says CEO

Bitcoin ATMs will likely see a global acceleration in installations after the Bitcoin halving, a period when crypto FOMO (fear of missing out) typically hits a fever pitch, according to the boss of a major Bitcoin ATM operator.In 2023, crypto ATM installs had their first-ever yearly decline in a decade, owing to a bear market likely exacerbated by the collapse of several crypto firms. However, Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz notes that 2024 has already started with a bang, with 1,469 crypto ATMs installed in just the first three months, compared to the over 3,000 removed by around the same time in 2023, according to data from CoinATMRadar.“It’s looking really positive that the industry continues to see a lot of growth in kiosk count,” Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Cointelegraph.Over 400 ATMs have been installed between March 1 and March 27. Source: CoinATMRadarMintz is now tipping an industry-wide ATM rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) back in swing, which has already twice beaten its all-time high in March.In past bull markets, Mintz noted that “later in the cycle, especially that period of FOMO that starts happening,” is when crypto adoption surges and, with it, brings more customers.“The adoption rate is really helpful because if more people are buying Bitcoin, then a portion of those are likely going to Bitcoin ATMs.”That, however, typically comes later in the cycle and “it’s still pretty early,” according to Mintz.“We aren’t even at the halving yet,” he said, mentioning the event slated for late April when Bitcoin’s mining rewards are cut 50%. “In the past, more of the uptick we’ve seen has been after the halving,” he added. “After the halving is when the price skyrockets the most, and that’s when the FOMO phase starts.”While the ATM count has recently climbed, Mintz claims over the past 18 months, the number of ATM operators has dropped. One of the largest was the 5,000 ATM-strong operator Coin Cloud, which went bankrupt in February 2023.“A lot more of them were struggling and went out of business than was shown publicly,” he said.The drop “happened pretty quickly” after crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022 and took the crypto market with it, he added.Bitcoin Depot’s fourth quarter and full 2023 results released on March 25 saw full-year revenues up 7% year-on-year to $689 million, though net income dropped 54% to $1.6 million. It also bought 900 ATMs to install in the first quarter of 2024 and has plans for 940 ATMs to go live in convenience stores in 24 United States states.According to CoinATMRadar, the Bitcoin ATM operator shares the market with a small number of other operators. The runner-up rival operator Coinflip has just over half that with over 4,200, while Bitstop is third with over 2,500.Spot Bitcoin ETFs are no botherOf the 37,001 crypto ATMs in the world, the United States is home to nearly 83% of them, with over 30,600, per CoinATMRadar.In January, the U.S. also approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which some have hailed as an adoption catalyst for institutions and retail punters looking to get into Bitcoin.Mintz was unshaken by what impact the ETFs could have on Bitcoin ATMs. “We view it as a totally different customer base,” he said.Related: Bitcoin ATM flaw could’ve given hackers ‘total control’“A large portion of our customer base transacts primarily in cash or only in cash because they’re underbanked or unbanked,” he added.On the other hand, Bitcoin ETF buyers are “more high-income individuals with brokerages and brokers.”“[The] vast majority of all of our customers make less than $90,000 to $100,000 a year, so our customer base is not that likely to have a brokerage account or a broker and has not been likely to have just been sitting on the sidelines waiting for [an ETF] when it’s so easy to just buy through a Bitcoin ATM,” Mintz said.Instead, he thinks the ETFs driving Bitcoin’s price higher could mean more ATM usage as Bitcoin adoption climbs.“If adoption increases, we think it likely translates to increased usage of Bitcoin ATMs. So in the grand scheme of things, I think it is way more helpful to us in our industry than it is in terms of impacting us in a negative way.”Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?

IMF Report Advocates for Digital Currencies to Boost Financial Inclusion in Pacific Islands



                    
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the potential of digital currencies, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), to enhance financial inclusion and improve financial services in the Pacific Islands.



 A report released by the IMF on March 25 delves into the impact these digital currencies could have on the economies of these remote and dispersed nations.




The 58-page document crafted by IMF’s senior economists identifies significant challenges for the Pacific Islands, emphasizing the importance of financial services for overcoming poverty and inequality. 



A particular concern for these nations is their heavy reliance on remittances and the detrimental effects of reduced correspondent banking relationships. 



The IMF sees digital currencies as a means to develop payment systems, broaden financial inclusion, and address these banking challenges.




Though the report leans towards the advantages of CBDCs, a preference of the IMF, it doesn’t disregard the role of private stablecoins, specifically those backed by foreign currencies. 



However, it advises against smaller Pacific Island countries issuing their own stablecoins due to the potential lack of regulatory oversight. 



Tether, a well-known private stablecoin, is specifically mentioned within this context.



For countries with their own national currencies and established banking systems, the report suggests a dual-structure CBDC model.

This approach involves the central bank issuing the digital currency while entrusting its operation to private entities. 



On the other hand, for nations without their own currencies, the IMF considers foreign currency-backed stablecoins as a viable option, contingent on strict regulation and supervision.



The report acknowledges that none of the Pacific Island countries currently use private cryptocurrencies or stablecoins officially. 



However, a few, including Fiji, Palau, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, are exploring the possibilities of adopting a CBDC.



The IMF has been a staunch advocate for the adoption of CBDCs globally. In November 2023, its managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, emphasized the importance of the public sector preparing to implement CBDCs. 



She posited that CBDCs could not only replace cash but also serve as a “safe and low-cost alternative” to private money, underlining the IMF’s support for digital currency initiatives as a means to foster financial inclusivity and resilience among the world’s most isolated economies.

Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Slams BTC ETF Recommendation Over Gold Assets Despite Record High For Precious Metal - Benzinga

Peter Schiff, a prominent critic of Bitcoin BTC/USD, has expressed his views on the potential of gold outperforming Bitcoin in the upcoming month despite the lack of recommendations for gold ETFs on CNBC’s Fast Money.What Happened: On Tuesday, Schiff took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his thoughts on the recent investment advice given on CNBCFastMoney. Despite the record-high close for gold, none of the crew members recommended buying a gold ETF or any gold mining stock. Instead, one member suggested buying one of the new Bitcoin ETFs.See Also: Dogecoin’s GigaWallet To Simplify Integration Of Transactions Across Platforms: ‘Beginning Of A Strong Bullish Move,’ Says TraderSchiff, being a known proponent of gold, has expressed his skepticism about the quality of US growth and has often highlighted the contrasting performances of gold and Bitcoin. He has critically observed the divergent paths of gold and Bitcoin ETFs’ performances despite both hitting record highs.Bitcoin has appreciated over 67% since 2024 began, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.07 on March 14. In contrast, spot gold has risen 8.25% in a similar period.Why It Matters: Schiff’s stance comes amid the cooling of the crypto rally and his consistent criticism of Bitcoin. His skepticism towards the apex cryptocurrency has been evident in his past statements and tweets. Despite expressing a twinge of regret for not purchasing Bitcoin back in 2010, Schiff has remained a staunch advocate of gold.He has repeatedly warned about the potential credit bubble in the US economy, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and has been critical of CNBC for consistently highlighting the positive gains of Bitcoin while often overlooking its declines.Schiff’s prediction for April comes at a time when Bitcoin ETFs have experienced their worst day since going public, whereas gold ETFs have continued to close at record highs. As Schiff suggests, this divergence in performance might be a sign of potential trouble ahead for Bitcoin and its ETFs.Price Action: At the time of writing, the price of BTC was $70,871, up 0.10% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro. On the other hand, spot gold was seen trading 1.72% higher at $2,232.37.Read Next: Here’s How Much $100 In Bitcoin Could Be Worth In 2030 If Cathie Wood’s New Price Target Is ReachedPeter Schiff Wikimedia Commons

Copper's Sushi Event Sparks Controversy and Prompts Internal Review | Cryptopolitan

In a recent turn of events that has stirred the fintech and cryptocurrency sectors, Copper, a prominent crypto custody firm, has found itself at the center of controversy following a sushi event that has been widely criticized for its insensitivity and lack of judgment. The event, which involved serving sushi on the bodies of models clad in thin bodysuits, has led Copper to issue a public apology and announce the initiation of an internal review to reassess its event approval and sponsorship processes.Public outcry and apologyThe event, hosted at the luxurious Mandrake hotel in London, was intended to be an immersive experience that engaged all five senses, according to promotional materials. However, the execution, which involved the use of human bodies as serving platters for sushi, sparked immediate backlash from attendees and the wider public. Critics condemned the event as objectifying and demeaning, arguing that it did not align with the professional and ethical standards expected of corporate events, especially within the progressive tech and financial sectors.In response to the growing criticism, Copper released a statement expressing regret over the incident. “We did not get this right,” the firm admitted, acknowledging the offense caused by certain aspects of the event. The statement emphasized that the controversial event did not reflect Copper’s corporate values, highlighting the company’s commitment to conducting an internal review. The review will focus on the processes for approving events and sponsorship arrangements, as well as evaluating the overall value and impact of such events on the company’s reputation and ethos.Copper’s internal review and future measuresCopper’s decision to launch an internal review signifies a crucial step towards addressing the fallout from the event and preventing similar incidents in the future. The review aims to scrutinize the existing protocols for event approval and sponsorship, ensuring they align with the company’s values and the expectations of its clients and the broader community. Copper, chaired by former UK chancellor Lord Philip Hammond and founded in 2018, serves a sophisticated clientele, including hedge funds, trading houses, and institutional investors. Despite its prominence in the crypto custody space, the firm has yet to secure regulatory approval from the Financial Conduct Authority, adding another layer of complexity to its operational challenges.The firm also indicated that a third party had organized the controversial event, suggesting a possible oversight or misalignment in the vetting process for external partners and event organizers. The revelation underscores the importance of stringent due diligence and alignment of values when outsourcing event management, especially for events that are intended to represent the company and its brand.Reflecting on corporate values and industry standardsThe incident has sparked a broader discussion within the fintech and cryptocurrency industries about corporate responsibility, ethical standards, and the importance of aligning company actions with stated values. As companies in these sectors strive to innovate and push boundaries, the Copper sushi event serves as a reminder of the need for sensitivity, inclusivity, and respect in all aspects of corporate conduct.Copper’s public apology and commitment to an internal review have been received as positive first steps towards rectification and accountability. However, the effectiveness of these measures will ultimately be judged by the firm’s ability to implement meaningful changes and ensure that future events and partnerships reflect its corporate values and respect for individuals.The controversy also highlights the evolving expectations of corporate behavior, especially in industries that are at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. As companies navigate the complexities of growth, innovation, and public scrutiny, the Copper incident serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of ethical considerations and the potential repercussions of oversight or misjudgment in corporate events and sponsorships.ConclusionCopper’s experience with the sushi event debacle underscores the delicate balance between innovative event planning and the maintenance of ethical standards and corporate values. As the firm embarks on its internal review and seeks to rebuild its reputation, the broader industry will be watching closely, potentially taking cues on how to better align corporate actions with the values they profess to uphold.

This Is Why Optimism (OP) Price Could Rally by 26%


Optimism (OP) price is prime for the picking since the broader market cues and investors’ behavior are signaling a buy signal.
The question remains: will OP generate more profits than it has since the beginning of the year, or will it be stopped mid-way?
Optimism Among Investors Is High
Although the beginning of the month was bleak for Optimism price, the altcoin found its footing in the last few days. This was the result of an increase in participation from OP holders. This is evident from the surge in active addresses, which has grown by over 30% in the last 24 hours.

Along with the increased activity of investors on the network and the decline in price, Optimism is exhibiting a buy signal. According to the price daily active addresses (DAA) divergence, OP is a good asset to accumulate at the moment.

Read More: What Is Optimism?
Price-Daily Active Addresses (DAA) Divergence occurs when a cryptocurrency’s price and the number of daily active addresses show contrasting trends, indicating potential discrepancies between market valuation and actual network usage or adoption. When the price goes down and participation increases, a buy signal is flashed, and vice versa.

Thus, if Optimism holders move to add OP to their wallets, the price could see a surge.

OP Price Prediction: Profits on the Way
Optimism’s price is presently trading at $3.72 after failing to breach the resistance marked at $3.99. Crossing this barrier would enable OP to reclaim $4.00 as a support floor, which will enable a rise towards $4.69, marking a new year-to-date high as well as a 26% rally.
Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate potential bullishness. RSI measures price momentum, indicating overbought or oversold conditions. MACD, on the other hand, is a trend-following indicator showing the relationship between two moving averages, signaling potential buy/sell opportunities.

At the moment, both indicators are at the cusp of a bullish reversal, which would support the anticipated 26% rally.

However, should OP fail to breach $4.00, Optimism’s price could note a decline of $3.42 losing, which would push the altcoin below $3.00, invalidating the bullish thesis.

Mystery malware targets Call of Duty cheaters, stealing their Bitcoin

A new flood of mystery malware has reportedly been targeting video gamers and draining their Bitcoin (BTC) wallets as part of a new info stealer campaign, which also has been targeting cheaters. Malware information repository vx-underground said in a March 28 X post it was aware of a “currently unidentified Threat Actor” using malware to steal login and other credentials of those using pay-to-cheat video game software.The attacks target players, including those who buy cheating software, and have compromised over 4.9 million accounts for Activision Blizzard users and its game store Battle.net along with accounts for a game-focused trading site Elite PVPers and cheat software markets PhantomOverlay and UnknownCheats.“Impacted users have begun reporting being victims of crypto-draining — their Electrum BTC wallets have been drained. We do not have any information on the amount of money stolen,” vx-underground wrote.Source: vx-undergroundIn a March 27 Telegram post, PhantomOverlay claimed the number of hacked accounts “are inflated” as over half of the logins in a database it viewed “are invalid garbage.”It added the malware “seems to be an entire network of free/cheap software” that has originated from “some latency program, VPN, or something that millions of gamers are using.”“It’s the largest infostealer malware campaign in gaming/cheating community history.”In a separate post, PhantomOverlay claimed it has “a pretty good idea of where the malware is coming from but the malware gang is aware of suspicions on them [and] has made it increasingly hard to prove anything.”Activision Blizzard had contacted the cheat-selling site and “will help us assist millions of infected users,” PhantomOverlay said.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson told Cointelegraph it was aware of claims that credentials “across the broader industry could be compromised from malware from downloading or using unauthorized software.”Related: Prisma Finance exploited in $10 million breachIt said its servers “remain secure and uncompromised” and recommended users change their password if they want to ensure their accounts are protected.In its post, vx-underground wrote that PhantomOverlay was “alerted of fraudulent activity when user accounts began making unauthorized purchases.”PhantomOverlay contacted the alleged victim, and since then, more have been identified, it said.Magazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise

Prisma Finance $11.6M hacker claims it was a ‘whitehat rescue’

The hacker behind the $11.6 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Prisma Finance is claiming it was a “whitehat rescue” and is enquiring about returning the funds, according to on-chain messages. “Hi, this is a whitehat rescue, who can I contact to refund,” the exploiter said on March 28, around 6 hours after the attack. The message came from the address “0x2d4…7507a” — which was earlier identified as being one of three addresses linked to the attack. “Please contact us at negotiations@prismafinance.com,” the DeFi firm said in response about two hours later.On-chain messages were sent between Prisma Finance and the hacker. Source: EtherscanA white hat hacker refers to a person who uses their hacking ability to find security vulnerabilities in software code. In the broader cybersecurity world, these security experts often notify the creator of the attack vector rather than exploiting it themselves. However, in the cryptocurrency industry, it is more common for hackers to exploit the protocol and then ask for a white hat bounty in exchange for immunity, though there have also been cases where they’ve returned funds without asking for any reward. The first batch of malicious transactions occurred at 11:29 am UTC on March 28. Prisma Finance is still investigating the root cause of the attack.Blockchain security firm PeckShield estimated about $11.6 million was stolen and sent to three separate addresses.The hacker then started swapping the stolen funds to Ether (ETH), according to blockchain security firm Cyvers. PeckShield later observed about 200 Ether was transferred to OFAC-sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash.Prisma Finance engineers have since halted the DeFi protocol. Source: PeckShieldPrior to the exploit, Prisma Finance had about $220 million in total value locked on its protocol, but that figure has plummeted to $115 million, according to DeFiLlama.Total value locked on Prisma Finance.

Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Recapture $0.7 While BTC Tops $70K - DailyCoin


        
Cardano is lagging in its recovery compared to its competitors.



While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have returned to their previous levels, ADA is struggling to reclaim $0.7.



Still, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon as indicators point to a potential rally.
Earlier in March, Cardano stole the spotlight after breaking through historical resistances and catapulting to its 2-year high of $0.8, sparking hopes of reaching the highly coveted $1 price level. With just a 20% gain remaining, ADA teetered on the edge of another breakthrough. However, as is often the case, the market quickly turned for the worse when Bitcoin tumbled and triggered chaos in the altcoin market. While many tokens have since bounced back to their previous levels, Cardano has been struggling in its recovery. Cardano’s Slow RecoveryExcitement quickly gave way to disappointment after Cardano experienced a sharp 30% decline in the second half of the month, dropping as low as $0.57. The primary catalyst for this downturn was Bitcoin’s sudden drop from its all-time high of $73,000 to $60,000.Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins across the board experienced drops as high as 30%, sparking chaos in the market. However, it wasn’t long until the market recovered, with ADA bouncing back to $0.61 after the Federal Reserve revealed its dovish outlook for 2024. Cardano Price Chart. Source: TradingView.Still, despite the overall market rebound, Cardano’s struggle to reclaim $0.7 raises concerns. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB have returned to their previous levels, ADA is struggling to regain its footing. At press time, Bitcoin exchanged hands for $70,500, Ethereum traded for $3569, and Solana for $188.Adding to the unease is the worrying trajectory of the Cardano-BTC pair as Bitcoin widens the gap with its historic run while ADA lags in its recovery. However, a glimmer of hope looms on the horizon. The last time the Cardano-BTC pair was at this level was in December 2023 when ADA surged by over 100%. ADA All-time High Soon?Except for Cardano, a majority of the top ten tokens are either near their all-time highs or have already reached new highs this year. ADA, in contrast, still has an 80% gain left to cover to reach its all-time high of $3.1.
While it remains uncertain whether ADA will gather enough momentum to surpass even $1, it wouldn’t be wise to underestimate the token. Last year, Cardano surged to become one of the leading gainers in the top 10 tokens, marking a 150% gain.
Considering historical patterns, Cardano is at a pivotal point and could begin its ascent. However, its success hinges on fresh capital rotating from Bitcoin to Cardano. As we navigate the weeks ahead, ADA must first rebuild investor confidence to reclaim its former glory.At press time Cardano traded at $0.65, boasting a daily trading volume of $442 million. On the Flipside
Market dynamics can be unpredictable, so it is essential to consider alternative perspectives and opinions when evaluating the potential future performance of ADA.



ADA’s yearly growth has since fallen to 45% from peaking at 63%. 
Why This MattersCardano’s sluggish growth could become a major concern for market participants, particularly as its competitors are either achieving new all-time highs or nearing them. ADA needs to restore investor confidence in the coming weeks through its price performance before the disparity between itself and its rivals widens too much.Crypto hackers are still running rampant in 2024:Crypto Hackers Siphon Over $300 Million in Q1 2024, ImmunefiLearn more about the ASI Alliance:What is ASI?

SBF memecoins pump and dump as FTX founder gets 25-year prison sentence

Memecoin degenerates have once again put their money on a swathe of questionable tokens — this time amid the historic sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, which saw him wrapped with a 25-year prison sentence. On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to a total of 25 years in prison on seven counts of fraud, making the former CEO the first person from FTX to face prison for the collapse of the exchange in November 2022 — referred to as one of the biggest corporate collapses in United States history.A few hours before Bankman-Fried’s sentence was handed down, however, a developer launched a memecoin dubbed Sam Baseman Fraud — humorously sporting the ticker FTX — on the Coinbase layer-2 network Base. In just seven hours, the FTX memecoin rallied more than 23,300%, with market capitalization peaking to $1.5 million on March 28, per DexScreener data,As many memecoins often do, the token proceeded to sell off harshly, dumping more than 85% within the span of three hours. At the time of publication, the memecoin’s price has leveled out and is trading around the $0.06 mark, still down 60% from all-time highs. Sam Baseman Fraud (FTX) rallied before selling off. Source: DexScreenerRoughly 2 hours following the sentencing, another SBF-themed memecoin dubbed Som Bonkmon Fraud launched on Solana (SOL).The Solana-based SBF memecoin initially surged to a market capitalization of around $20 million, a rally of more than 18,000% from its launch value of $30,000. However, the token sold off rapidly, plunging more than 95% from its high.Som Bonkman Fraud pumped and then brutally dumped. Source: DexScreenerAt the time of publication, it’s trading around $0.0008 — only slightly above its first listed price. Related: Crypto users react to Sam Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentenceThe Bankman-Fried-themed memecoins are the latest addition to a roster of topical memecoins inspired by crypto and political figureheads. Several other political memecoins, such as Boden and Tremp have sought to capitalize on the attention around the upcoming United States election.The memecoin trend witnessed a major resurgence following the upward surge of a Solana-based memecoin called Dog Wif Hat (WIF), which spiked from a market cap of around $50,000 to $3.5 billion in four months. Several other newer meme tokens, such as the frog-themed Pepe (PEPE) on Ethereum and Rooster-themed Coq Inu (COQ) on Avalanche, have also rallied to the upside. Memecoins are hyper-speculative investments that ofte offer no utility or base valuation outside of topical interest and hype. Notably, FTX Token (FTT) — the native cryptocurrency of the now defunct exchange — also nosedived more than 16% on the news of Bankman-Fried’s sentencing, per CoinGecko data.

Vitalik Buterin wants rollups to hit stage 1 decentralization by year-end

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is proposing to raise the bar on what’s considered a rollup in the Ethereum ecosystem — and suggests developers should aim to get their decentralization efforts in order by the end of the year. The comments came in his latest blog post on March 28, reflecting on the year ahead following Ethereum’s latest Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees for rollups on layer 2.Buterin noted that Ethereum was in the “process of a decisive shift” from a “very rapid L1 progress era” to an era where L1 progress will still be very significant.He also said that Ethereum’s scaling efforts have shifted from a “zero-to-one” problem to an incremental problem, as further scaling work will focus on increasing blob capacity and improving rollup efficiency, he said. Source: Vitalik ButerinHe continued to state that the ecosystem’s standards will need to become stricter, adding: “By the end of the year, I think our standards should increase and we should only treat a project as a rollup if it has actually reached at least stage 1.”Stage 1 is Buterin’s classification of layer-2’s decentralization progress, whereby a network has advanced enough in terms of security and scaling but is not yet fully decentralized (which would be stage 2).He observed that only five of the layer-2 projects listed on L2beat are at either stage 1 or 2, and only Arbitrum is fully EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible. The next steps on the roadmap include implementing data availability sampling to increase blob capacity to 16MB per slot, optimizing layer 2 solutions through techniques like data compression, optimistic execution, and improved security.L2 data compression. Source: Vitalik Buterin“After this, we can cautiously move toward stage 2: a world where rollups truly are backed by code, and a security council can only intervene if the code “provably disagrees with itself,” he added. Related: Vitalik Buterin is cooking up a new way to decentralize Ethereum stakingButerin said that further changes such as Verkle trees, single-slot finality, and account abstraction are still significant, “but they are not drastic to the same extent that proof of stake and sharding are.” “In 2022, Ethereum was like a plane replacing its engines mid-flight. In 2023, it was replacing its wings.”Ethereum is currently at “The Surge” phase of its upgrade roadmap with upgrades related to scalability by rollups and data sharding. The next phase, “The Scourge,” will have upgrades related to censorship resistance, decentralization, and protocol risks from MEV.Developers should design applications with a “2020s Ethereum” mindset, embracing layer-2 scaling, privacy, account abstraction, and new forms of community membership proofs, he said before concluding: “Ethereum has upgraded from being ‘just’ a financial ecosystem into a much more thorough independent decentralized tech stack.”Magazine: ‘Account abstraction’ supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide

Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI Today - The Daily Hodl


								
 
AI (artificial intelligence) has caused frenzied excitement among consumers and businesses alike – driven by a passionate belief that LLMs (large language models) and tools like ChatGPT will transform the way we study, work and live.
But just like in the internet’s early days, users are jumping in without considering how their personal data is used – and the impact this could have on their privacy.
There have already been countless examples of data breaches within the AI space. In March 2023, OpenAI temporarily took ChatGPT offline after a ‘significant’ error meant users were able to see the conversation histories of strangers.
That same bug meant the payment information of subscribers – including names, email addresses and partial credit card numbers – were also in the public domain.
In September 2023, a staggering 38 terabytes of Microsoft data was inadvertently leaked by an employee, with cybersecurity experts warning this could have allowed attackers to infiltrate AI models with malicious code.
Researchers have also been able to manipulate AI systems into disclosing confidential records.
In just a few hours, a group called Robust Intelligence was able to solicit personally identifiable information from Nvidia software and bypass safeguards designed to prevent the system from discussing certain topics.
Lessons were learned in all of these scenarios, but each breach powerfully illustrates the challenges that need to be overcome for AI to become a reliable and trusted force in our lives.
Gemini, Google’s chatbot, even admits that all conversations are processed by human reviewers – underlining the lack of transparency in its system.
“Don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want to be reviewed or used,” says an alert to users warns.
AI is rapidly moving beyond a tool that students use for their homework or tourists rely on for recommendations during a trip to Rome.
It’s increasingly being depended on for sensitive discussions – and fed everything from medical questions to our work schedules.
Because of this, it’s important to take a step back and reflect on the top three data privacy issues facing AI today, and why they matter to all of us.
1. Prompts aren’t private
Tools like ChatGPT memorize past conversations in order to refer back to them later. While this can improve the user experience and help train LLMs, it comes with risk.
If a system is successfully hacked, there’s a real danger of prompts being exposed in a public forum.
Potentially embarrassing details from a user’s history could be leaked, as well as commercially sensitive information when AI is being deployed for work purposes.
As we’ve seen from Google, all submissions can also end up being scrutinized by its development team.
Samsung took action on this in May 2023 when it banned employees from using generative AI tools altogether. That came after an employee uploaded confidential source code to ChatGPT.
The tech giant was concerned that this information would be difficult to retrieve and delete, meaning IP (intellectual property) could end up being distributed to the public at large.
Apple, Verizon and JPMorgan have taken similar action, with reports suggesting Amazon launched a crackdown after responses from ChatGPT bore similarities to its own internal data.
As you can see, the concerns extend beyond what would happen if there’s a data breach but to the prospect that information entered into AI systems could be repurposed and distributed to a wider audience.
Companies like OpenAI are already facing multiple lawsuits amid allegations that their chatbots were trained using copyrighted material.
2. Custom AI models trained by organizations aren’t private
This brings us neatly to our next point – while individuals and corporations can establish their custom LLM models based on their own data sources, they won’t be fully private if they exist within the confines of a platform like ChatGPT.
There’s ultimately no way of knowing whether inputs are being used to train these massive systems – or whether personal information could end up being used in future models.
Like a jigsaw, data points from multiple sources can be brought together to form a comprehensive and worryingly detailed insight into someone’s identity and background.
Major platforms may also fail to offer detailed explanations of how this data is stored and processed, with an inability to opt out of features that a user is uncomfortable with.
Beyond responding to a user’s prompts, AI systems increasingly have the ability to read between the lines and deduce everything from a person’s location to their personality.
In the event of a data breach, dire consequences are possible. Incredibly sophisticated phishing attacks could be orchestrated – and users targeted with information they had confidentially fed into an AI system.
Other potential scenarios include this data being used to assume someone’s identity, whether that’s through applications to open bank accounts or deepfake videos.
Consumers need to remain vigilant even if they don’t use AI themselves. AI is increasingly being used to power surveillance systems and enhance facial recognition technology in public places.
If such infrastructure isn’t established in a truly private environment, the civil liberties and privacy of countless citizens could be infringed without their knowledge.
3. Private data is used to train AI systems
There are concerns that major AI systems have gleaned their intelligence by poring over countless web pages.
Estimates suggest 300 billion words were used to train ChatGPT – that’s 570 gigabytes of data – with books and Wikipedia entries among the datasets.
Algorithms have also been known to depend on social media pages and online comments.
With some of these sources, you could argue that the owners of this information would have had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
But here’s the thing – many of the tools and apps we interact with every day are already heavily influenced by AI – and react to our behaviors.
The Face ID on your iPhone uses AI to track subtle changes in your appearance.
TikTok and Facebook’s AI-powered algorithms make content recommendations based on the clips and posts you’ve viewed in the past.
Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri depend heavily on machine learning, too.
A dizzying constellation of AI startups is out there, and each has a specific purpose. However, some are more transparent than others about how user data is gathered, stored and applied.
This is especially important as AI makes an impact in the field of healthcare – from medical imaging and diagnoses to record-keeping and pharmaceuticals.
Lessons need to be learned from the internet businesses caught up in privacy scandals over recent years.
Flo, a women’s health app, was accused by regulators of sharing intimate details about its users to the likes of Facebook and Google in the 2010s.
Where do we go from here
AI is going to have an indelible impact on all of our lives in the years to come. LLMs are getting better with every passing day, and new use cases continue to emerge.
However, there’s a real risk that regulators will struggle to keep up as the industry moves at breakneck speed.
And that means consumers need to start securing their own data and monitoring how it is used.
Decentralization can play a vital role here and prevent large volumes of data from falling into the hands of major platforms.
DePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) have the potential to ensure everyday users experience the full benefits of AI without their privacy being compromised.
Not only can encrypted prompts deliver far more personalized outcomes, but privacy-preserving LLMs would ensure users have full control of their data at all times – and protection against it being misused.

British Columbia Courts Target Quadriga CX Exec's Wealth Origins


																The province of British Columbia is taking proactive steps in its battle against financial crime, with the latest move targeting Michael Patry, the co-founder of the defunct Canadian largest crypto exchange, Quadriga CX.
Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, announced the filing of a third unexplained wealth order (UWO) with the British Columbia Supreme Court, aimed at seizing assets potentially linked to criminal activity.

If successful, the order could lead to the forfeiture of assets worth $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, luxury watches, and expensive jewelry, Farnworth said in the press release dated March 27.
Farnworth also emphasized that the focus isn’t just on flashy assets like gold bars and luxury goods; it’s about disrupting the financial incentives of criminal enterprises.
By targeting ill-gotten gains, authorities aim to strip criminals of their resources and prevent further harm to victims.

“We will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect the proceeds of crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.”

Quadriga CX, once considered Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a collapse in 2019. The platform shut down its operations and subsequently declared bankruptcy.
The CEO and founder of the company, Gerald William Cotten, mysteriously passed away in 2018 during a trip to India.
Following his demise, it was discovered that he owed around $190 million in crypto to 115,000 customers that either went missing or remained inaccessible, as Cotten was the sole holder of the passwords to offline cold wallets.
In March 2022, Netflix released a documentary named “Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King.”

                        Dogecoin has witnessed a remarkable surge, touching $0.217210 with trading volumes soaring to $5.84 billion.The meme coin’s ascent of nearly 12% positions it as the 8th largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of over $31 billion.Despite the absence of a maximum supply cap, Dogecoin’s circulating tally stands at 143.66 billion. Let’s take a look at Dogecoin price prediction and fundamental’s outlook.Dogecoin Price Prediction
The pivot point is established at $0.2063, with Dogecoin currently exceeding this threshold, indicating a bullish sentiment.Resistance levels are pegged at $0.2255, $0.2449, and $0.2661. Should Dogecoin’s upward trajectory persist, these markers will be crucial to watch.Conversely, support levels are found at $0.1888, $0.1699, and $0.1483, which could stabilize any potential downturns.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 77 hints at an overbought condition, suggesting a possible pullback.Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.1756 reflects the sustained bullish trend.The breach of the upward channel at $0.2190 hints at further potential gains, but the appearance of an inverted hammer pattern warns of a potential correction.Dogecoin Soars on X Platform Speculation and Musk’s Influence
Dogecoin’s price rally to its highest since December 2021 has been underpinned by significant speculation within the community, particularly concerning its integration into the X platform’s payment system.Despite the broader market’s stability, Dogecoin remains sensitive to developments related to Elon Musk’s enterprises, including X and Tesla, driving speculative trading.Recent discussions within the Dogecoin community about X’s payment branch gaining more licenses in the U.S. have sparked expectations of cryptocurrency payment implementations.While Elon Musk previously stated that X Payments’ initial phase wouldn’t feature crypto, the community remains abuzz with anticipation.Conclusion
The current trajectory of Dogecoin is bullish above the $0.2255 mark, with potential for further escalation if it maintains above this level.However, the market must remain cautious of an overbought RSI and the speculative nature of recent price movements.If Dogecoin falls below $0.2255, it could signal a shift towards a bearish correction.Embracing the Future: Dogecoin20 Unleashed
Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) revolutionizes the meme coin domain by integrating Dogecoin’s charm with Ethereum’s cutting-edge capabilities. As an ERC-20 token, it offers staking for passive income, aligning with the original Dogecoin ethos while harnessing Ethereum’s proof-of-stake for eco-friendly, efficient transactions.Stake and Earn with Dogecoin20: Dedicated to rewarding its community, Dogecoin20 allocates 15% of its supply to staking rewards within the first two years, providing a generous first-year reward pool.

Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Is $300 Possible After the Bitcoin Halving? (Analyst)


																The host of Coin Bureau, Guy Turner, tells his two million followers on YouTube that SOL might be on a potential 35% – 45% breakout above the $300 mark.
Turner’s bullish outlook is based on promising weekly and monthly charts throughout the beginning of 2024. According to him, SOL is looking “incredibly bullish” on both timeframes, facing stiff resistance at the $300 mark.
Can SOL Reach $300 After the Bitcoin Halving?
The analyst paired SOL against Bitcoin to showcase an even more bullish chart, given that BTC pairs demonstrate an altcoin’s strength.
Moreover, Turner highlighted that the Bitcoin halving is nearing, and the market expects that this event will catapult BTC to new heights.
“Given that Bitcoin’s halving is just around the corner, it’s likely that BTC’s price will rally. That means a 35 to 45% gain in SOL versus BTC would bring it above the $300 milestone.”
Turner emphasized that SOL’s price will be heavily influenced by the development of four upcoming milestones, as per the Solana Foundation’s updated roadmap. These milestones include the release of token extensions, the launch of new validator clients like Firedancer, more institutional support, and developer engagement.




Solana TVL Reaches New ATH
Solana has surpassed $4.6 in total value locked across its diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), according to data from DefiLlama.
The surge comes amid a new inflow of users partially driven by the meme coin mania, of which several Solana-based such tokens have experienced substantial gains through the week.
As CryptoPotato reported, another important reason for Solana’s price and TVL increase can be attributed to the overall bullish sentiment coming from retailers and institutional investors alike.

Grayscale Maintains Optimism for May Approval of Spot Ether ETFs Despite SEC Engagement Concerns



                    
Despite concerns regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) engagement level with spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applicants, Grayscale remains optimistic about approval prospects in May. 



Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm, in a recent X post, underscored his confidence, stating, “I don’t think perceived lack of engagement from regulators should be indicative of one outcome or another […] I personally am not deterred by it and believe the ETFs should be approved.”




Salm highlighted that the groundwork laid by the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs has addressed many issues relevant to spot Ether ETFs, including the mechanics of creation and redemption, asset protection strategies, and custody concerns. 



He suggested that the SEC’s prior engagement in these areas means that there’s less new ground to cover this time, with the exception of the complexities introduced by staking in spot Ether ETF proposals.



Notably, firms such as Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which are looking to include staking features in their ETFs, face additional regulatory scrutiny. 




Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have expressed reservations about the SEC’s apparent disengagement, recently adjusting their approval odds to a “pessimistic 25%.”

Balchunas indicated that the SEC’s stance appears more strategic than procrastinatory.



Nevertheless, the path for spot Ether ETFs seems paved by the recent approval and regulation of Ether Futures ETFs. 



The classification of these products as commodity futures suggests a favorable precedent for spot Ether ETFs, given the historical correlation between futures and spot markets. 



This view is supported by Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Brian Quintenz.



With several prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex, applying for SEC approval, the decision anticipated by May 23 is keenly awaited. 



The outcome for VanEck’s application on this date is expected to signal the fate of all pending spot Ether ETF proposals.

Grayscale’s GBTC outflow was $105 million, which is the lowest it has been since March 12. The crypto asset manager has now shed around 284,846 BTC from its GBTC fund since it converted to a spot ETF in mid-January. Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs regain traction, posting $418M net inflowsIn related news, Bitwise filed an S-1 application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for their spot Ethereum ETF on March 28. Fellow ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reacted to the news stating that his odds for ETH ETF approval in May remain a pessimistic 25% but he could go lower. There are seven weeks until the deadline and the radio silence from SEC is bleak, he added.

XRP Price Holds Support - Indicators Show Risk of Downside Break


                            XRP price is holding gains above the $0.60 zone. The price could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $0.570 support zone.

XRP is facing a major hurdle near the $0.6580 zone.
The price is now trading below $0.640 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $0.5720 support.

XRP Price Faces Uphill Task
After a steady decline, XRP price found support near the $0.5720 level. A low was formed at $0.5714 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
There was a move above the $0.5880 and $0.600 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5714 low. The bulls pushed the price above the $0.620 resistance zone, but the bears are active near $0.640.
Ripple’s token price is now trading above $0.6320 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.640 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The next key resistance is near $0.6580. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5714 low. A close above the $0.6580 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.700. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.700 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.7440 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.800 resistance.
More Losses?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.640 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.600 zone.
The next major support is at $0.5720. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5720 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.5250 support zone.
Technical Indicators
4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.
4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.600, $0.5720, and $0.5250.

Tron Accounts for Nearly Half of Illicit Transactions: Report


According to analytics firm TRM Labs, the Tron blockchain is responsible for a whopping 45% of illegal cryptocurrency transactions in 2023,  the South China Morning Post reports. The blockchain, which is associated with controversial entrepreneur Justin Sun, is becoming increasingly popular with drug traffickers, but Bitcoin still maintains the lead there. Tron has emerged as an increasingly attractive option for criminals due to its speed and low transaction fees. The report states that Tether, the top stablecoin, accounted for more than $19 billion of illegal transactions. Roughly 1.6% of the stablecoin's total volume was linked to criminal activities. The Tron-based USDT token, which was introduced back in March 2019, has now become the primary choice for terrorism financing, according to TRM Labs. As per data provided on Tether's website, Tron-base USDT has a market cap of $54 billion, which makes it the top stablecoin on the blockchain. The Ethereum-based token comes in second place with $49 billion. Tether believes that the volume of illicit transactions that involved its flagship stablecoin has been exaggerated, according to a statement made by the company's spokesperson. A recent UN report has also singled Tron as the preferred choice for bad actors. However, Tron DAO said that such an allegation was inaccurate in its statement, arguing that it is "actively engaging" with blockchain forensics companies. It added that it was "flawed" to assume that we could exercise direct control over those who use the technology.  As reported by U.Today, the Tron founder was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last March.

SBF's Fall From Crypto King to Convict: The $11 Billion FTX Fraud Case | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 28 March 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Samuel Bankman-Fried (aka “SBF”), a co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the trading firm Alameda Research, had been sentenced to 25 years in prison. The sentence, delivered by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, also includes three years of supervised release and an order for Bankman-Fried to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.



The DOJ’s announcement elaborates on SBF’s misdeeds, detailing how he misappropriated billions of dollars of customer funds deposited with FTX. Furthermore, according to the DOJ, he defrauded investors in FTX of more than $1.7 billion and lenders to Alameda of over $1.3 billion. These actions led to SBF being found guilty of multiple charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering.



According to a report by CoinDesk, in court, SBF’s lawyer, Mark Mukasey, portrayed his client in a compassionate light to Judge Kaplan, emphasizing that SBF’s actions were driven by analytical thinking rather than malicious intent, describing him as an individual guided by logic and mathematics rather than greed or a thirst for power. Highlighting SBF’s personal challenges, including autism and social difficulties, alongside his altruistic values, Mukasey characterized him as an extraordinary individual with a remarkable intellect and work ethic. He appealed to the judge, requesting leniency to preserve SBF’s future prospects, including the chance to start a family, portraying his client as a unique yet fundamentally human figure deserving of compassion.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Attorney General Merrick B. Garland commented on the case, emphasizing the grave consequences of defrauding customers and investors: “Anyone who believes they can hide their financial crimes behind wealth and power, or behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand, should think twice.” As for FBI Director Christopher Wray, he said: “Today’s sentencing should serve as a warning to others looking to use fraudulent means for personal gain — there are consequences for your actions.”



U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York also weighed in, characterizing SBF’s actions as one of the largest financial frauds in history: “His deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers’ expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers’ money to expand his own power and influence. The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight.”



Judge Kaplan granted permission for the authorities to allocate the assets obtained via forfeiture to reimburse the victims of Bankman-Fried’s offences.

                        Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has sued two Nigerian agencies, accusing them of infringing his basic human rights.Local media outlet Premium Times reported Thursday that the suit was filed against the Natural Security Adviser (NSA) and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on March 18.Meanwhile, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional manager for Africa, has also lodged an individual lawsuit for rights enforcement with Justice Ekwo. Anjarwalla, who eluded lawful detention on March 22, is pursuing the same legal remedies as Gambaryan.Binance didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.The lawsuits follow the detention of both executives and the confiscation of their passports in February as part of a wider crypto exchange crackdown in Nigeria. Nigerian authorities alleged that Binance violated local tax regulations by failing to provide proper documentation (VAT invoices) and hindering tax collection from its users.This crackdown was related to Nigerian Naira experiencing frequent depreciation compared to the US dollar.Binance Exec Demands Release and Passport Return in Nigerian Legal Saga
According to Premium Times, Gambaryan (a US citizen) argued that his detention and passport confiscation violated his right to personal liberty enshrined in Articles 35(1) and (4) of the Nigerian Constitution. He petitioned for his immediate release and the return of his passport.He further requested a permanent court order barring the authorities from detaining him in connection with any future investigation or demands related to Binance. Additionally, he sought a public apology from the authorities and compensation for all legal expenses incurred.In a supporting affidavit, Gambaryan clarified that he visited Nigeria on Feb. 26 solely as a Binance representative, attending a meeting requested by the authorities to discuss relevant issues.He further asserted that he neither committed any offense during the meeting, nor received prior written notification of any alleged wrongdoing in Nigeria.Nigerian Court Sets New Hearing Date
During the hearing on Thursday, a senior Nigerian lawyer, TJ Krukrubo, appeared on behalf of both executives, but clarified they lacked official legal representation. He notified the court of a previously submitted withdrawal notice filed for Anjarwalla on March 26.In light of the missing representation, Justice Echo postponed the case until April 8. This adjournment allows the applicants to secure legal counsel and provides the respondents with additional preparation time.

Binance Executives File Lawsuit Against Nigeria’s NSA and EFCC


							

Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan sues Nigeria’s NSA and EFCC for allegedly violating his fundamental rights.



Gambaryan’s colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla also filed a separate lawsuit against the Nigerian authority.



The lawyers requested the court release Binance executives and return their passports.




In a recent update on Binance’s legal tussle with Nigeria, two Binance executives filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian authorities following Nigeria’s decision to arrest the executives. 



According to a recent Reuters report, Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, sued Nigeria’s National Security Adviser (NSA) and the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allegedly violating his fundamental rights.



In the originating motion filed on March 18, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Olujoke Aliyu, sought five reliefs before Justice Inyang Ekwo. The lawyers requested that the court permit Gambaryan’s release from legal custody and retrieve his passport.



In addition, Gambaryan sought a public apology from the NSA and EFCC and an injunction order against the authority’s future investigation.



The lawyers requested the court consider his detention and the seizure of his passport a “violation of his fundamental right to personal liberty” as guaranteed by Nigeria’s constitution. In addition, Binance’s African regional manager, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who fled from custody on March 22, filed a lawsuit separately in court.



These incidents happen on the heels of the Nigerian Department of State Security’s arrest of the two Binance executives in Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja. Following the Nigerian authorities’ finding that Binance Nigeria was allegedly involved in an illicit flow of $26 billion, executives were arrested and their passports seized.



The lawyers further explained Gambaryan and his colleague’s innocence, stating that they were arrested on February 26, when they came to Nigeria on an invitation from the NSA and EFCC to discuss the legal conflicts involving Binance. They added, “The only reason for his detention is because the government is requesting information from Binance and making demands on the company.”

Bitcoin To Skyrocket by Over 110% if History Repeats, Says Hedge Fund Veteran Mark Yusko - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The co-founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko is doubling down on his prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit a six-figure price over the coming months.
Yusko says in a new CNBC interview that Bitcoin could triple in price from its current fair value or double in price from its post-halving fair value.










According to the veteran hedge funder, Bitcoin’s fair value is estimated based on the number of users and miners or its network effects.
“So we look at the fair value today from the Metcalfe’s Law model… that gives us around $50,000. The halving occurs in three weeks. What a halving does is it cuts the block rewards, the amount of money that’s given to the miners to secure the network. If those rewards were to get cut in half, as they do, many of the miners would struggle. So historically what has happened? The price rises, the fair value rises. So that would push it to $100,000.
But this time it’s a little different in that instead of just block rewards, we get transaction fees because of ordinals and inscriptions. So let’s say the fair value only goes to $75,000 this time. Then post-halving you get a lot of interest in the asset, a lot of people FOMO (fear of missing out) in and we normally go to about two times fair value in the cycle. 
So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000.”
Bitcoin is trading at $70,882 at time of writing.
According to Yusko, Bitcoin could reach the peak for the bull cycle that will ensue around nine months after the halving.
“So the big move happens post-halving. So the halving occurs sometime between April 20th and April 21st most likely. So once that occurs then you start to get an increase in demand right from the [spot Bitcoin] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other people interested. But the supply of new coins goes from 900 a day to 450.
Well, think about it… if there’s more demand than supply, price has to rise. So the price starts to rise. It starts to become more exponential or parabolic toward the end of the year, and historically, about nine months after the halving. So sometime toward Thanksgiving, Christmas we see the peak in price before the next bear market.”

Analysis Company: "This Asset Could Take Over The Spotlight As Bitcoin Stalls" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency research firm Wolfe Research suggests that gold could potentially outperform Bitcoin as the Bitcoin price hovers around $70,000.
Both of these assets have traded in sync over the past month, hitting new records even as the U.S. stock market continues to trade near its highest levels.


According to analysts, Bitcoin's trading patterns mirror its own 2021 movements, where it rose to new all-time highs twice before experiencing a significant pullback. “Bitcoin has historically traded more like a ‘risk asset,’ often finding a home for excess liquidity for the retail investor,” said Rob Ginsberg, managing director at Wolfe.
Ginsberg is not predicting a 50% correction like last time, although the similarities with the 2021 model are undeniable. However, he would not be surprised to see Bitcoin continue to hold steady just above $70,000.






On the other hand, according to the analyst, gold may be in a better situation. “Gold and Bitcoin ratio is approaching support while oversold on a weekly basis,” Ginsberg said and added:

“If our views on Bitcoin are correct and it continues to consolidate in the $60,000-$73,000 range, this could provide a good opportunity for gold to start outperforming.”

Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,679 on March 14 and fell to around $60,800 last week as traders absorbed the run. Although Ginsberg warned that selling pressure “has historically emerged strongly above $70,000,” BTC has since rebounded to its highs and looks poised to accelerate again.

Can GMT repeat its 70% hike to cross $1? - AMBCrypto



GMT broke out past the resistance zone that rejected the bulls earlier this month.
Metrics reflected a healthy bullish bias, but sustained gains could hinge on Bitcoin breaking out.

Stepn [GMT] posted outsized gains in the past eight days. From 20th March’s low at $0.2506, GMT rallied to $0.445, a move that measured 77.57%. A few hours before press time, GMT prices fell to $0.406 and could dip lower.
Earlier in March, AMBCrypto reported that the on-chain metrics of GMT were healthy, and a bullish run of 70% or more could commence. However, Bitcoin [BTC] fell below $70k and nearly touched $60k just a few days later, dragging GMT prices down by 30%, from $0.3822.
Sentiment was firmly bullish once more

GMT did not rally as expected, but it did show strength during its resurgence. AMBCrypto looked closely at on-chain metrics to see if the token could maintain its bullish momentum.
The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) metric has been in a downtrend throughout January. This was a bullish sign and showed old coins re-entering circulation and rising demand.
The weighted sentiment was also strongly positive, reflective of the recent gains the token saw. The network growth also ticked higher in the second half of March.
The MVRV ratio shot higher alongside prices to reflect holders at a profit. While this was a positive outcome, it could lead to selling pressure in the form of profit-taking activity shortly.
Examining the supply distribution

AMBCrypto analyzed the behavior of wallets holding different brackets of GMT tokens. The smaller holders, encompassing up to 100k GMT, saw a downtrend in March. This was especially pronounced in the 1k-100k GMT holders.
This suggested that holders were taking profits as prices rose.
On the other hand, wallets with 100k-10 million of the tokens made up a greater percentage of the supply distribution in the past three weeks. What it means is possible accumulation from whales.

Realistic or not, here’s GMT’s market cap in BTC’s terms

It is hard to be conclusive with this metric alone, but overall, the health of GMT remained bullish. The sharp BTC correction forced sentiment to sour across the altcoin market.
Perhaps this time favorable conditions will last longer for the bulls.

ERC-7231: Ethereum Community Backs CARV’s NFT Standard for Value Redistribution to Users in the AI Revolution



                    Santa Clara, US, March 28th, 2024, Chainwire


CARV, the modular data layer for gaming and AI, today announces the final approval of ERC-7231 – the protocol that establishes a revolutionary system of data self-sovereignty, empowering users to possess, manage, and contribute their information to both AI systems and data consumers, thereby enabling the equitable sharing of generated value.
Ethereum Community greenlighting the standard is a major step in bridging disparate digital identities and enabling users to own their online history, relationships, and experiences across platforms.
ERC-7231 binds multiple Web2 and Web3 identities to a single non-fungible token (NFT) and achieves encrypted aggregation of multi-domain identity data. The result is an “identity of identities” that enables self-authentication, social overlapping, and commercial value generation from targeted user data.
“At long last, this solution breaks down identity silos, rewrites the rules of data ownership, and lays the foundation for a user-owned internet where individuals can have an equitable share in value distribution,” said CARV Co-Founder Victor Yu.
ERC-7231 offers three important benefits at the dawn of Web3. First, the protocol’s integration with account abstraction wallets makes Web2 and Web3 onboarding (and therefore adoption) easier. Second, uniting multiple identities under one banner enables greater interoperability between different platforms and services. Third, users exercise unprecedented control over their data to decide how it’s used. If they opt to share this data, for example, users can passively earn whenever brands leverage their on-chain and off-chain identity information.
Case in point: CARV ID is integrated with the standard and already empowering users to manage their digital presence across the gaming universe with ease and confidence. More than 900,000 CARV ID holders are playing their favorite games and earning rewards across CARV’s comprehensive ecosystem, which spans from its foundational data stack, its gaming-focused application layer, to the increasing list of games integrated with CARV ID. CARV has also developed an AI Agent in house, where more nuanced data can be scrapped in a privacy-preserving way and attributed to CARV ID. Entities building on CARV’s modular data layer, such as MARBLEX which recently just announced their strategic partnership with CARV, can tap into this rich data source for game and AI development. ERC-7231 is “the key to stringing everything together,” said Yu.
Understanding gamers today is increasingly difficult due to app tracking changes (IDFA) and shifting privacy regulations (CCPA). With ERC-7231, users can not only aggregate, own, and control their identities, but gaming and AI companies can leverage this zero- and first-party data to create customized experiences and more accurately target gamers.

For example, according to the company, improved user acquisition was the aim of Electronic Arts and its latest game, EA Sports FC Tactical, in Indonesia. Utilizing CARV as one of the primary channels for user acquisition, EA recently recruited Indonesian gamers for the beta test at a lower Cost Per Install (CPI) than traditional channels. Better yet, the game can better understand each gamer and their history thanks to ERC-7231’s aggregated data from multiple gaming accounts.
“Backed by this standard, brands can shift and shape their offering with quality and compliant data, and users can share in the value creation from this information. We welcome all user identity solutions to adopt ERC-7231 and usher in a new age of identity-aggregated NFTs,” said Yu.
About CARV
CARV is the largest modular data layer for gaming and AI, revolutionizing how data is used and shared. CARV ensures privacy, ownership, and control are firmly in the hands of individuals and provides gaming and AI development with holistic and high-quality data reinforced with human feedback in a regulatory-compliant, trustless way. To pioneer a future where data generates value for all, CARV has built CARV Protocol, the modular data layer integrated with 40+ chain ecosystems, and CARV Play, its flagship gaming superapp. CARV has more than 2.5 million registered users and 700 integrated games.

Mem Token Wind in the Markets: This Solana-Based Mem Token Outperformed PEPE! Are DOGE and SHIB Next? - Bitcoin Sistemi

While the mem token craze has increased recently, Solana-based mem tokens have come to the fore.
Among the Solana-based mem tokens, Dogwifhat (WIF) is undoubtedly the most notable project, while Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, also listed WIF.


At this point, while WIF has experienced an unstoppable price rise this year, the WIF price exceeded $ 4 today and left PEPE behind, becoming the third largest meme token after DOGE and SHIB, with a market value reaching $ 4 billion.
WIF, which exceeded $ 4 with an increase of more than 230% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $ 3.68 with a 19% increase at the time of writing.





With this increase, WIF topped the list of the most profitable altcoins, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI).



As WIF continues its unstoppable rally, WIF's largest holding address, 2Fcm…PE6d, made a profit of $134 million (+1440%). This whale started buying WIF in December 2023 at an average purchase price of $0.248.
Analysts stated that despite the tremendous rise in WIF, the data shows that the whale has not started to sell, “which indicates that the upward expectations in WIF continue.” said.





Analysts also stated that they expect the Dogwifhat price to continue to increase and with this increase, the WIF market value will exceed $10 billion in the next few years and WIF will gain the status of a premium meme token.

Kerrisdale Capital on BTC and MSTR: 'Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL' | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent report titled “Long Bitcoin / Short MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR): Know When to HODL, Know When to FODL,” Kerrisdale Capital Management outlines a bold investment strategy. The hedge fund advocates going long on Bitcoin directly while simultaneously shorting shares of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a publicly traded company known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation tactics.



Kerrisdale Capital is a hedge fund known for its short-selling investment strategy, where they profit from declines in a company’s stock price. The firm often targets companies they believe are overvalued or have questionable business practices, publishing in-depth research reports to support their short positions. Kerrisdale has a history of attracting controversy due to their aggressive approach and the potential conflict of interest inherent in short-selling activities. Despite this, they have a track record of identifying potential weaknesses in companies across various industries



Kerrisdale argues that MicroStrategy’s stock price implies an inflated Bitcoin valuation of over $177,000 – more than 2.5x the current spot price. They assert that the company’s historical premium over Bitcoin’s actual price is unsustainable. Kerrisdale believes that as more accessible and affordable Bitcoin investment vehicles emerge, such as ETFs and ETPs, MicroStrategy will lose its appeal.



Kerrisdale questions MicroStrategy’s self-proclaimed status as a “Bitcoin development company.” They point out that the core software analytics business represents a tiny fraction of MicroStrategy’s overall value. According to Kerrisdale, the company’s stock price is almost entirely driven by its Bitcoin holdings, which were largely acquired through debt financing and equity-linked offerings.



The report disputes the argument that MicroStrategy’s use of leverage and share dilutions to buy Bitcoin creates superior shareholder value compared to direct Bitcoin ownership. Kerrisdale highlights that while MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings may have increased, the dilution has kept Bitcoin holdings per share relatively stagnant.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Kerrisdale questions other justifications for MicroStrategy’s high premium. They deem the ability to reinvest cash flows from the software business into Bitcoin insignificant, citing minimal free cash flow generation. The lack of management fees in holding MicroStrategy compared to a spot Bitcoin ETF is also dismissed by Kerrisdale, especially considering the substantial premium and the low fees of spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC.



Kerrisdale’s thesis hinges on the expectation that the extreme premium commanded by MicroStrategy shares will return to more historically consistent levels. They note that since early 2021, MicroStrategy’s premium has only exceeded 2.0x on 6% of trading days, with an average of 1.3x. This suggests considerable room for the premium to contract, potentially resulting in a significant decline in MicroStrategy’s share price.



Kerrisdale emphasizes that their investment strategy is not based on a bearish view of Bitcoin or MicroStrategy itself. They are simply wagering on the distortion between the two assets correcting. It’s also crucial to remember that Kerrisdale Capital has both a short position in MicroStrategy and a long position in Bitcoin ETFs, standing to profit if their analysis proves accurate.



On Thursday, a day during which the Bitcoin price was more or less stable, thanks to all the short-selling of the stock, MSTR closed at $1,704.56, down 11.18% (though still up 148.79% for the year-to-date period).

FTX former execs and promotors to settle class lawsuit for $1.3M

Former FTX executives and promotors have come to a nearly $1.36 million settlement with a class action group of the crypto exchange’s former investors seeking compensation for being defrauded.FTX co-founder Zixiao “Gary” Wang, former engineering lead Nishad Singh and sister trading firm Alameda Research ex-CEO Caroline Ellison agreed to cooperate and give information to the lawsuit to resolve the claims against them, according to a March 27 Miami federal court bid seeking the settlements’ approval.Settlements were also reached with seven other influencers and former FTX chief regulatory officer and FTX.US chief compliance officer Daniel Friedberg.The former execs didn’t admit to any of the lawsuit’s allegations, but the class group found the trio’s “knowledge and other information” would be valuable in strengthening its case against others it sued — including celebrities, companies and venture capitalists.A highlighted excerpt of Ellison’s settlement notes her testimony against former boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried could help the suit — the FTX MDL (multidistrict litigation). Source: PACERWang, Singh and Ellison will turn over — and have already begun sharing — “all non-privileged documents and/or data” they gave when helping prosecutors lock up their old boss Sam Bankman-Fried for 25 years.The three each face their own sentences after pleading guilty to fraud. The class will affirm their cooperation with the court before their sentencing. The former execs will also hand in records used in FTX’s bankruptcy case and make themselves available for depositions and hearings.The settlement agreement further saw the three agree to forfeit their assets for the judge in their criminal case to decide the recovery and distribution of victim funds.They are not to oppose a request from FTX investors that the funds be distributed through the class suit, as opposed to FTX’s proposed bankruptcy paybacks or other lawsuits.A settlement with Friedberg was also reached, with the filings noting he has voluntarily “provided valuable information” to the class group and “has agreed to do so on an ongoing basis.”Related: Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prisonFriedberg’s settlement notes he “did not have knowledge of the FTX fraud,” and after he found out about it, he “immediately resigned” and “promptly contacted the authorities.”Seven YouTubers and influencers also paid to settle the suit, including $180,000 from Brian Jung, $122,000 from Kevin Paffrath, $37,485 from Tom Nash, $10,000 from Graham Stephan, and $5,000 each from Jeremy LeFebvre and Andrei Jikh.Information for American football star William Trevor Lawrence’s settlement wasn’t available, but he seemingly paid $1 million to settle based on the total disclosed relief minus the other agreements’ sums.All named in the settlements were released “from all claims related to any of the alleged conduct giving rise to this litigation.”Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?

Bitcoin Vs. Gold Vs. SPY: Which Asset Class Would've Given Best Returns On $1000 Investment In Q1? - SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY) - Benzinga

The first quarter of 2024 has turned out to be a blockbuster for most asset classes, and the strong performances have left investors worried about the sustainability of the uptrend.How long will the party last? What are the risks involved in investing in an overbought market? Benzinga collated views from analysts and economists to make sense of the rally so far and zero in on the opportunities that could pay off in the near to medium term.Equity Market — From Shaky Start To Strong Surge: The equity market kicked off the new year with a whimper, with concerns that 2023’s gains might not hold. However, the momentum from last year carried through, quashing skepticism and propelling the market to new highs.Three months in, the S&P 500 Index has notched record highs for both closing and intraday trading. Blue-chip stocks mirrored this performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing the quarter at a fresh record. Tech stocks were once again at the forefront, fueled by the AI boom that spurred gains for companies of all sizes. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t quite reach its record peak as valuation concerns prompted some profit-taking near the quarter’s end.                               Source: Benzinga The more heartening aspect of the recent rally is that, unlike in 2023 when it was nearly exclusively fueled by tech, this time around, the participation has broadened. LPL Financial‘s Chief Technical Strategist, Adam Turnquist, said in a recent note that the strong uptrend in the S&P 500 Index is supported by broad participation and cyclical leadership. “Improving relative strength in industrials, financials, and materials provides additional evidence of a bullish rotation that has largely been overshadowed by mega-caps and AI enthusiasm,” he said.See Also: Investing In Stocks For BeginnersAI optimism drove much of the upside early in the quarter, with stocks such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Microsoft Corp. MSFT — the ones at the forefront of the revolution — clocking strong gains for the year.

Nvidia (+83%)



Constellation Energy Corp. CEG: +58%



Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK: +41%



Micron Technology, Inc. MU: +38%
On the flip side, Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Boeing Co. BA, which were hit by negative headlines (softening EV demand and supply-side bottlenecks; airplane safety concerns), were the worst S&P 500 stocks, shedding 29% and 26%, respectively, for the quarter.Cable telecom company Charter Communications, Inc. CHTR, trading platform provider MarketAxess Holdings Inc. MKTX, and medical and specialty insurance products company Humana, Inc. HUM rounded up the list of worst performers.Gold’s Dazzling Run: Gold rode on the dollar’s weakness as the greenback took a hit from expectations that the Fed is ready to cut the Fed fund rate, which currently hovers at 22-year highs. The yellow metal shares an inverse relation with the dollar as it is denominated in the latter.The precious metal ended the quarter at a record high of $2,254.80 and on an intraday basis, it peaked at $2,256.90 on Thursday.Current LevelQTD Change2023 PerformanceGold futures (Price/troy once)$2,254.80*+8.83%+13.45%*record closing highBitcoin Builds On Gains: The crypto space began to see an accelerated rally in late 2023, and the gains continued into 2024. In the run-up to the spot Bitcoin BTC/USD approval, the space saw solid gains, and the momentum stalled in a typical “sell-the-news” move after the approval came through.

However, inflation and the Federal Reserve’s actions are seen as key drivers for the financial markets.Larry Tentarelli, Chief Technical Strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, shared exclusive comments with Benzinga. He highlighted incoming inflation data, especially the Consumer Price Index and Personal Consumption Expenditure Index, as crucial factors. Additionally, economic data on GDP growth, non-farm payrolls, and 10-year Treasury bond yields will be closely watched to determine the market’s course.Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz Investment Management, agreed with Tentarelli. He emphasized the Federal Reserve’s actions as the most significant influence on the market. “The current stance from the Fed is that they will follow through with 3 rate cuts this year, but sentiment could shift quickly if inflation measures remain sticky and the Fed is forced to stay on hold for longer,” he said. Ripley, however, flagged concentration risk. Any faltering on the earnings front could pose a risk to the rally, he said.Tentarelli said he is very bullish on U.S. large caps, based on easing bond yields and inflation, and the earnings season, which starts in mid-April. The analyst sees further momentum for AI stocks much against fears of a bubble burst. “We are very bullish on the AI stock leaders and think that valuations are very reasonable here,” he said.Tentarelli named Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, and Super Micro as his AI stock picks.He is also exceedingly bullish on Bitcoin and expects the apex cryptocurrency to rally past $100,000 by the year-end. The upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around April 19-20, could be the catalyst driving it higher, although he advised keeping an eye on bond yields.“The one caveat here is for bond yields to not break out over 4.40[%],” he said.Fund manager Louis Navellier said he sees earnings estimate revisions likely to be the main market driver in the near term. He also noted that the next two quarters will have easier comparisons, making the bar manageable to scale. “There is a fear of missing out, you know, with the Nvidia and super microcomputer strength, but there are other hot pockets,” Navellier said, referring to weight-loss drug companies such as Novo Nordisk A/S NVO and Eli Lily & Co. LLY. Among the other stock picks flagged by Navellier were:
Cloud security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD and Fortinet, Inc. FTNT



AI names Nvidia and Super Micro



Norwegian provider of browser and mobile browsers Opera Limited OPRA



Homebuilders, particularly Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL



Consumer companies with a direct model, especially e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ELF

Bitcoin Cash open interest surges past $700M ahead of BCH halving

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at $574.84, having jumped 9.06% over the past 24 hours as the second-ever BCH halving event is set to take place next week.Traders appear to be heavily securing their positions in anticipation of the BCH halving, which is scheduled for April 4, according to NiceHash data.On March 28, $190,140 was liquidated in short positions and $211,870 in long positions. On the same day, open interest (OI) in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts reached all-time highs of $708.75 million, spiking 18.26% in 24 hours and 165% over the past 7 days, as per CoinGlass data.Bitcoin Cash open interest surged to record highs ahead of the halving next week. Source: CoinGlassThe last instance nearing this level was in May 2021, with OI reaching $684.12 million, coinciding with BCH reaching its highest price in the past five years at $1,399.This is in contrast to the same date in 2020, where futures open interest stood at $63.29, just before the first-ever BCH halving on April 8, 2020.At the time, miner rewards halved from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH. However, miners seem to be taking this as a cue to increase their mining efforts ahead of the upcoming halving.

Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) Whales See Algotech (ALGT) as Best Presale Opportunity in 2024 After $3M Presale | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $70,000 at the beginning of 2024. This is caused by the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. Crypto whales are buying up Bitcoin (BTC) in anticipation of its scarcity doubling. The crypto bull run has left early investors smiling, with top coins and altcoins hitting all-time highs.Despite Bitcoin’s rising prices, large cryptocurrency investors such as Microstrategy are buying Bitcoin (BTC) in large quantities. Other altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) are not far behind. However, the market is currently experiencing a slight correction in the Bitcoin price, which may allow alternative cryptocurrencies to attract some investment capital from these large investors.12-hour downtime on the Polygon (MATIC) network sparks concern among the investorsThe network experienced an outage of 12 hours due to a glitch in the protocol sequencer. This has impacted the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEM). The outage has made room for speculation about the network’s credibility, reliability, and scalability. Polygon (MATIC) dropped 8% in market value. It is now selling for $1.03 in the crypto market, with a total market cap of $10B, and is ranked 16th. It is celebrated for providing a solution to blockchain’s inherent limitations regarding speed and transaction costs. However, the decreasing value has shifted investors’ interest to other altcoins.Immutable (IMX) Price Slides as Bears Take Over Immutable X is known for its ability to work above limitations like low scalability, poor user experience, and a low developer experience. It helps users with instant trading and massive scalability. However, the IMX token is sliding further into the bear market. Its value has fallen by 20% in the previous month.Moreover, IMX’s market cap is down. Its rising trading volume can trigger a resurgence; however, holders continue to look for alternatives. Some analysts anticipate that IMX will not show a price rally as it has fallen below the $3 support zone.While Polygon (MATIC) and Immutable X (IMX) may make excellent investments, a massive opportunity awaits in the Algotech (ALGT) presale.Algotech Emerges as the Best Presale Opportunity After $3M PresaleAlgotech’s (ALGT) scalable infrastructure and impressive project roadmap can handle real-time issues such as large trade volumes and rapid execution. As demand for advanced trading tools increases, Algotech’s TradFi platform will become more relevant with its advanced technology and cutting-edge use cases.Despite being just weeks into the launch, the project has managed to defy market expectations with a massive $3.2 Million public presale round. Stage 2 of the presale grabbed significant attention after 80 million ALGT tokens were sold out within two weeks, reaching 85,000 unique holders. Algotech uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to help traders with efficiency and precision. It relies on decentralization and AI technologies for real utility, encouraging adoption in DeFi.ALGT token value is anticipated to skyrocket beyond its current $0.06 level as the presale demand heats up. Analysts believe that its value can reach an all-time high of $1 before it gets listed on more exchanges. This makes Algotech the best crypto to buy in 2024. It has also announced a giveaway to celebrate this milestone: $250K in ALGT tokens will be distributed to 10 lucky winners. Learn more:Visit Algotech PresaleJoin The Algotech Community

Logan Paul: "il progetto NFT CryptoZoo non è una truffa"

Logan Paul from the NFT CryptoZoo project, accused of scamming his audience, has returned to assert his version in a new documentary. 

Logan Paul and the new documentary: his version on his NFT project CryptoZoo
Logan Paul, famous YouTuber and WWE fighter, is back in the spotlight with his NFT project CryptoZoo that, in the past, caused investors to lose money. Specifically, Paul once again claims that CryptoZoo is not a scam. 
In a new documentary “5 Months with Logan Paul”, journalist Graham Bensinger met with Paul and, regarding CryptoZoo, stated that Paul’s exposure “has led people to lose money”.
On this subject, here is how Paul responded: 
“Everything you just said has an element of truth. The problem is this. What you just described is not a scam. I took on a project that I simply wasn’t able to handle at that time. […] I didn’t make any money, brother. I lost half a million dollars on this project. Where’s the scam?”.
CryptoZoo was announced 3 years ago, with the launch scheduled for September 2021, but Paul’s NFT project still does not exist. In practice, Paul and his team sold NFTs and released a ZOO token, but the game has never materialized. 
With this documentary, Paul would like to confirm his version that his NFT project was difficult for him to manage, but that it was not a scam to investors. 
Logan Paul and the new documentary about his NFT project CryptoZoo
Continuing with the documentary, Paul also stated that he had suicidal thoughts because of his CryptoZoo project. He felt like he was entering a tunnel, from which he was able to come out.
Another thing that Paul does in the documentary dedicated to him is to promise that he will “take care” of those who have plotted to make it seem like he has set up his scam. 
In this regard, Logan Paul had received a class action, or collective legal action, in February 2023, precisely for the never-happened launch of CryptoZoo.
Not only that, such legal action is of the “rug pull” type, accusing Paul and his team of raising funds for a new token or NFT collection, without keeping the promises made about the benefits and advantages but abandoning the project and keeping the buyers’ funds.
And indeed, the accusations against the defendants speak of trading NFTs to buyers, claiming that they would have received benefits, rewards, and exclusive access to other crypto resources at a later time, as well as the support of an online ecosystem for using and trading NFTs. 
Refund to defrauded investors
After six months from his video in which he outlined his plan to fix things, which was in July 2023, Paul had not yet refunded any of his defrauded investors.
Once again, another unkept promise for the YouTuber, who had announced his three-phase plan to fix things, which was to start refunding.
The latest news on this topic, then, arrived at the beginning of January 2024, when Paul stated that he will “buy back” the CryptoZoo NFTs, but even here there would be a “scam”.
Basically, the program provides that holders of NFTs receive 0.1 ETH for each eligible NFT, but they must also waive any current or future claims against Paul.

Bitcoin to attract $1T from institutions amid ‘raging bull market’ - Bitwise exec

Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan said institutional investors would likely inject as much as $1 trillion into Bitcoin (BTC) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as they slowly move into crypto.In a memo sent to investment professionals, Hougan addressed concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility. As the asset bounces between $60,000 and $70,000, the executive said the best approach would be to “keep calm and take the long view.”Source: BitwiseWhile the price seems unstable in the short term, Hougan noted many key events to look forward to in the coming months and years. These include the Bitcoin halving and the spot Bitcoin ETFs getting approved on national account platforms like Morgan Stanley or Wells Fargo.Furthermore, the executive highlighted that the space has to wait for investment committees and consultants still conducting their formal due diligence on Bitcoin. This is a necessary step they have to take before investing in the asset. Related: Bitcoin Halving: Latest News and Full Coverage by CointelegraphHougan said that while the space waits for these key events, the BTC price would likely “chop sideways” whenever there are small changes in sentiment; however, the investment officer believes things would be different long-term. Hougan wrote: “But long-term, we believe Bitcoin is in a raging bull market. Not only is it up nearly 300% in the past 15 months, but there are strong reasons to think that will continue.”According to Hougan, the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January opened crypto to investment professionals in a major way. Related: 3 theories why the SEC may be eyeing down Ethereum: Crypto lawyerHe also believes that investment professionals who control trillions of dollars are just starting to move into crypto. Hougan highlighted that onboarding more professional investors would “take years, not months.”The executive also said that the $12 billion flowing into ETFs since their launch is exciting and is “the most successful ETF launch of all time.” However, he believes that once global wealth managers begin to allocate 1% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, this would mean $1 trillion in inflows into the space. “A 1% allocation across the board would mean ~$1 trillion of inflows into the space. Against this, $12 billion is barely a down payment,” he added.Magazine: Ether ETFs face Senate opposition, Wright is not Satoshi, and Dencun goes live: Hodler’s Digest, March 10–16

Support for This Altcoin from Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin! Price Reacted Backwards! - Bitcoin Sistemi


There is no calm on the Worldcoin (WLD) front, which has been at the center of discussions and investigations since its launch.
Worldcoin, which was recently vetoed by Spain and Portugal, received support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.


At this point, responding to a post about the recent negativities that Worldcoin has faced in Portugal, Buterin said that he believes Worldcoin has done a pretty good job of introducing system design changes in response to privacy criticisms.
Accordingly, Vitalik Buterin once again expressed his appreciation for Worldcoin and said:






“They're actually doing a pretty good job of taking privacy criticisms seriously and designing their systems to be increasingly data minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.”

Vitalik has previously stated that Worldcoin's efforts towards privacy protection are much higher than other centralized authentication solutions.
At the time of writing, WLD price has not yet reacted to Vitalik Buterin's post. WLD, which has dropped around 2% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $ 8.35.

Binance exec seeks redress over Nigeria detention, demands apology

Binance’s head of financial crime compliance has asked the Federal High Court in Nigeria to mandate the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to issue an apology to him regarding his detention in the country.According to local reports, Tigran Gambaryan is suing the government for violating his fundamental human rights. Gambaryan’s motion claims that his detention in Nigeria soon after his arrival in February and the confiscation of his passport violates the country’s constitution, which guarantees an individual’s right to personal liberty.In the lawsuit, Gambaryan disclosed that the federal government is using his ongoing detention “as a means to exert pressure and persist in making requests to Binance.” The motion emphasized that Nigeria could communicate with Binance through other channels instead of detaining Gambaryan, who only attended a meeting.Source: Obinna Uchechukwu UzoijeThe financial crime compliance head for Binance also reportedly requested the court to order the immediate return of his passport and the issuance of a public apology. Nadeem Anjarwalla, regional manager of Africa at Binance, detained alongside Gambaryan, also lodged a similar complaint. Anjarwalla reportedly escaped Nigerian detention recently.During the court session, Gambaryan’s attorney informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that their application had been served to the respondents, who still had time to reply. The lawyer requested an adjournment for the ONSA and EFCC to respond. The judge granted the request, postponing the case to April 8.Related: Binance’s Russian successor CommEx to shut down in AprilAmong Nigerian crypto enthusiasts, various theories have risen in a bid to make sense of the situation. An enthusiast, who identifies as Chineduokoli expressed concerns about the possibility of getting proper redress in a Nigerian court.Another individual, Obinna Uchechukwu Uzoije, questioned the delay in the Binance executive’s decision to file a lawsuit against the agencies and speculated whether his colleague’s escape prompted it.Gambaryan, a United States citizen, and Anjarwalla, who holds both British and Kenyan citizenship, purportedly landed in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Feb. 25.

What Are Bitcoin Runes? Biggest Update Since Ordinals


								On Thursday, Bitcoin Ordinals founder Casey Rodarmor unveiled the documentation for a new Bitcoin-native digital commodities protocol known as Runes. This groundbreaking update is set to coincide with Bitcoin’s upcoming halving, marking a significant evolution in the Bitcoin protocol’s capabilities for handling digital assets directly on its blockchain.


What Are Bitcoin Runes?
Runes introduce a novel fungible token protocol on Bitcoin, utilizing an indexer-based model that builds upon the social consensus mechanisms first popularized by the Ordinals initiative. This new protocol facilitates the etching, minting, and transferring of Bitcoin-native digital commodities, potentially altering the landscape of how digital assets are created and exchanged on the Bitcoin network.

According to analysis by ren (wassie arc) (@0xren_cf) from Electric Capital, shared via X (formerly Twitter), “The biggest update since Ordinals is coming to BTC at the halvening… RUNES.” Ren’s analysis highlights several key features and improvements that Runes brings to the table:

Simplified Transactions: Unlike the BRC-20 token standard, which requires multiple transactions for deployment, minting, and claiming, Runes streamline these operations into a single transaction.
Extendability and Future Proofing: Runes feature an even-odd field tagging system within their protocol, allowing for future extensions and programmability through soft forks.
Larger Namespace for Tokens: Runes expand the available character space for token names up to 28 characters, compared to BRC-20’s four-character limit.
Security Enhancements: Runes addresses several security concerns, including the prevention of spoofing through the exclusion of Unicode symbols and mitigating the risk of token balance lockup by attackers.
Unique Token Naming: Runes enforces unique naming for tokens, preventing the creation of tokens with duplicate names. “Rune names shorter than 13 characters will be gradually released over a 4 year period after the runes launch to prevent immediate grabbing of the shortest names,” Ren remarked.

One of the most innovative aspects of the Runes protocol is its approach to token issuance and transfer. Utilizing a UTXO-based system, Runes tokens are directly issued into a UTXO during the transaction that sets their initial supply, ticker symbol, and decimal precision. This mechanism not only aligns closely with Bitcoin’s native design principles but also enables more efficient and flexible management of token balances and transfers.

The introduction of Runestones, described as the “precompiles” for Runes, further enhances the protocol’s capabilities. These instructions, stored within the OP_RETURN of a transaction, facilitate the movement of Runes from inputs to outputs and ensure future compatibility through an even-odd tagging system.
However, users are cautioned to be mindful of the specific tags used, as even-tagged Runestones can lead to the effective burning of the involved Runes, a process referred to as creating a “Cenotaph” by Rodarmor.
Vision For The Future
Looking forward, the Runes protocol aims to support a wide array of applications and interactions, from intricate inscriptions that could, for example, influence the abilities of digital collectibles based on the amount of a specific Rune held, to facilitating off-chain liquidity pools for Rune trading. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Bitcoin network, a prospect that has garnered excitement within the community.
Ordiswap Labs, through a statement on X, emphasized the potential of Runes to enhance the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem, noting the protocol’s efficient on-chain footprint and compatibility with existing Bitcoin standards, including the Lightning Network. “Runes aims to provide a simple, Bitcoin-native token system with a unique issuance model and efficient on-chain footprint […] Runes are one that we are now specifically looking into, and we cannot be more excited about the potential of the BTC DeFi ecosystem in the coming months!”


The activation of the Runes protocol is strategically timed to coincide with the Bitcoin halving, with expectations set for a block height of 840,000, around April 20.
At press time, BTC traded at $70,366.

                        While the overall cryptocurrency market remains relatively stable, meme coins have been gaining momentum, with Dogwifhat emerging as a front-runner. The red-hot Solana-based meme coin has recently reached a new all-time high, becoming the third largest meme coin by market cap after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Starting the day at $3.21, the coin experienced sideways trading until around 9 am ET, after which it witnessed a sudden spike. Earlier today, it reached an all-time high of above $4 and is currently trading at $3.73, up by more than 20% over the past day. Dogwifhat’s Strongest Daily Performance
The recent performance marks Dogwifhat’s strongest daily showing since its launch. The coin has surpassed the more established meme coin Pepe, securing the 38th position in the Top 100. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Dogwifhat has a market cap of $3.7 billion, while Pepe settles in 43rd place with a market cap of $3.32 billion.It is important to note that meme coins are highly volatile and lack strong fundamentals. The vision behind WIF is simply “literally just a dog wif a hat.” As a result, they are influenced by random events, such as tweets, unrelated news, and the movements of other coins. Market sentiment plays a larger role in driving these tokens than any tangible factors.Other meme coins are also performing well today. In the overall Top 100 of the crypto industry, the four best-performing tokens are meme coins: Dogecoin (+16.83%), Floki (+12.7%), and BONK (+10%). Outside of the top 10, PEPE has seen an 2% increase and is currently trading at $0.000007883 per token, while Shiba Inu is up 5.85% to $0.00003179. A total of 65 out of the 100 biggest meme coins have posted gains in the last 24 hours.Solana Emerges as Preferred Blockchain for Meme Coins
Solana (SOL), a blockchain platform known for its low transaction costs, has emerged as a preferred venue for trading these coins. According to data from CoinGecko, the Solana meme coin sector has surged by 13% over the past week and more than 40% over the past month. The platform has seen a wave of new coins featuring caricatures of public figures like Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in presale scams amid the meme coin season on the Solana blockchain, which continues in full force.Just recently, crypto detective ZachXBT highlighted several presale coins that have raised concerns due to fraudulent activities and suspicions of being rug pulls. One instance involves X user @Sartoshi0x, who received 7,000 SOL as part of a presale but secretly kept 62% of the funds without distributing the tokens as promised. The surge in Solana meme coin presale scams comes as these events have amassed a staggering $150 million in SOL from only 33 presales. Despite the allure of quick gains, ZachXBT emphasizes that many of these projects, often promoted by smaller accounts, are either dubious or outright scams.

Vitalik Buterin Says Worldcoin Takes Privacy Criticism Seriously


                        
                            Vitalik Buterin Says Worldcoin Doing Good Job at Taking Privacy Criticism Seriously

                        Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently commented on Worldcoin’s attempt to ensure user data’s privacy, acknowledging their effort.Replying to a user’s post on social media Buterin addressed to the project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, saying that Worldcoin has done “quite a good job” when it comes to protecting personal information with cryptography.“IMO [In my opinion] they actually have been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal,” said Buterin.“Modern cryptography is truly amazing,” he said.Buterin’s Concerns and Skepticism
In October 2023, Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about Worldcoin, especially its fundamental mechanism that verifies human identity via iris scanning. He discussed its “digital passport” that differentiates humans from AI but raised privacy and accessibility issues.Buterin noted the system’s potential to solve “anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems,” yet he cautioned, “If proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.”His primary worry was the extensive data collected through iris scanning, potentially revealing personal details like sex, ethnicity, and medical conditions.Regarding Worldcoin’s global accessibility, Buterin was skeptical, pointing out, “Even with much higher-scale distributed manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there’s an Orb within five kilometers of everyone.”Governments Act to Regulate Worldcoin
Worldcoin’s biometric data collection practices have recently faced regulatory actions globally.In Portugal, the National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) temporarily halted Worldcoin for 90 days on March 26, due to concerns over collecting iris and facial scans without adequate consent, particularly from minors.Similarly, in Spain, the Data Protection Agency (AEPD) issued a three-month ban on Worldcoin’s data collection starting March 6, citing similar issues. Legal appeals by Worldcoin were rejected by a local court, affirming the AEPD’s decision.These instances reflect a growing scrutiny of Worldcoin by regulators in different jurisdictions, including Hong Kong and Kenya, where concerns over privacy risks and biometric data collection have led to investigations and restrictions on the platform’s activities.

Bitcoin Behemoth Transfers Over $6 Billion, Signaling Institutional Investors' Growing Faith in Crypto Ahead of Halving



                    
In a significant move within the cryptocurrency community, a notable Bitcoin whale, identified only as “37X,” has shifted an enormous sum of over $6 billion in Bitcoin to three separate addresses, marking the first such transaction since 2019. 



This transfer saw the whale relocating nearly its entire stash of 94,500 Bitcoin, valued at $6.05 billion as of March 23, leaving a mere 1.4 BTC in the original wallet. 




The details of this massive transaction were shared by Arkham Intelligence on March 25, stating, “$5.03B BTC was sent to bc1q8yj, with addresses bc1q6m5 and bc1q592 receiving $561.46M and $488.40M in BTC respectively. bc1q592 has since sent those funds onwards.”



This whale activity coincided with a surge in Bitcoin interest from institutional investors, partly fueled by the anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event set for late April. 



This event is expected to cut the reward for mining new blocks in half, a significant change that has historically impacted Bitcoin’s price. 




Despite Bitcoin achieving a record price level prior to this halving, experts believe the market has yet to fully account for the impending reduction in supply. 



A D8X co-founder and former UBS executive director highlighted to Cointelegraph that the price increase does not fully reflect the anticipated supply squeeze.

The timing of the whale’s transfer was also noteworthy, occurring just as Bitcoin surpassed the $70,000 mark on March 25 after a 10-day absence from this price point. 



This resurgence is part of a broader trend of Bitcoin accumulation off exchanges, with Coinbase’s Bitcoin supply dropping to a nine-year low. 



According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s price saw a 6.4% increase in the 24 hours leading up to March 25, reaching $71,222.



The current Bitcoin rally is largely attributed to halving anticipation and increased institutional investment, including from traditional financial institutions launching Bitcoin-related products. 



Ten Squared’s partner, Christopher Cheung, mentioned to Cointelegraph, “The involvement of traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in launching BTC products is further legitimizing cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. 



“This reduces the ‘career risk’ for investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market.” 



The growth in Bitcoin ETFs, with a combined total of $58.3 billion in on-chain holdings, underscores the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class among investors.

Bitwise applies for Ethereum ETF; Bitbot presale gathers steam with price expected to rise to $0.0141



                    

                    
Bitwise applies for Ethereum ETF emphasizing spot trading but omitting staking features.
Bitbot presale raises over $1.6 million, BITBOT tokens currently going at $0.0134.
Next Bitbot presale stage expects BITBOT price to rise to $0.0141.

Bitwise Asset Management has taken a bold step forward in the cryptocurrency market by applying to an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), despite facing regulatory challenges.
At the same time, Bitbot, a new Telegram bot, is also making waves as its token presale quickly sells out through its presale stages.
Bitwise’s application for an Ethereum ETF
Bitwise filed its S-1 form with the U.S. SEC for what it is calling the Bitwise Ethereum  ETH ETF with the SEC on Thursday. The application marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey into the cryptocurrency investment space. 
The Ethereum ETF application includes a comprehensive correlation analysis between Ethereum and Bitcoin, highlighting similarities in market dynamics and bolstering the case for Ethereum ETF approval.
Following the approval of its spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise aims to replicate its success with Ethereum.
The company’s decision to venture into Ethereum ETFs underscores its confidence in the potential of Ethereum as a viable investment asset.
Unlike some competitors, Bitwise’s proposal focuses solely on the spot trading aspect of Ethereum, omitting mention of staking features present in other ETF filings. This strategic differentiation aims to streamline the approval process and position Bitwise uniquely in the competitive ETF landscape.
Bitbot: empowering crypto trading with innovative features
In parallel with Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF endeavours, Telegram continues to innovate in the cryptocurrency trading sphere with its new trading bot Bitbot.
Bitbot is a non-custodial Telegram trading bot designed to democratize access to advanced trading tools for users of all experience levels.
With features like automated sniping, limit orders, copy trading, and yield optimization, Bitbot provides users with institutional-grade trading capabilities directly from the convenience of Telegram.
Central to Bitbot’s ecosystem is its native token, BITBOT, which serves as a utility coin offering holders various benefits.
BITBOT holders enjoy revenue sharing, exclusive access to presales, unique perks, and governance rights, empowering them to participate actively in Bitbot’s strategic direction.
Bitbot presale 
Bitbot’s ongoing presale has garnered significant attention and support from the crypto community.
With over $1.621 million raised thus far, the presale demonstrates strong investor confidence in Bitbot’s vision and capabilities.
In the current presale stage, BITBOT tokens are available at $0.0134, offering investors an opportunity to secure their stake in Bitbot’s ecosystem at an attractive rate.
Looking ahead, the next presale stage presents an opportunity for investors as the price is expected to rise to $0.0141.
With Bitbot’s innovative features and promising roadmap, the presale serves as a gateway for investors to become early adopters and contributors to Bitbot’s continued growth and success.

Binance Introduces Ethena (ENA) as 50th Launchpool Project | Coinspeaker



The introduction of Ethena to Binance Launchpool coincides with the protocol planned website launch later today, March 29, 2024

Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market value, has announced the addition of Ethena (ENA) to its Launchpool, making the protocol the 50th project to join the program.
The announcement comes a few weeks after Binance unveiled EtherFi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) network focused on liquid staking, as the 49th project to enter the program.




Users to Start Farming ENA on Binance
Ethena is a synthetic dollar and internet-native yield platform built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Its synthetic dollar, USDe, aims to bring stability and scalability to the DeFi ecosystem.
The platform utilizes delta-hedging against Ethereum collateral to maintain USDe’s peg and introduces the ‘Internet Bond’ for yield opportunities from staking and derivatives.
Starting on March 30, 2024, users can farm Ethena’s native token, ENA, by staking their BNB and FDUSD tokens alongside other projects in the Binance launchpool.
With a total circulating supply of 15,000,000,000 ENA, Binance said it will initially release 1,425,000,000 ENA, representing 9.5% of the total supply. Additionally, the exchange has allocated 300,000,000 ENA, constituting 2% of the maximum supply, as Launchpool token rewards.
Binance to List ENA on the Exchange
The farming event is scheduled to last three days, and only users from non-restricted regions can participate in the program.
Users from certain regions have been restricted from participating in the token’s farming due to regulatory issues. The company said that users in Australia, Canada, Cuba, the Crimea Region, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, North Korea, Syria, the United States of America and its territories, and non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine are not eligible to farm ENA.
Nevertheless, the exchange assured users that the list of prohibited countries could change according to regulatory updates.
Binance also disclosed that on April 2, 2024, at 08:00 (UTC), the company will officially list ENA on the platform. The listing will come with a range of trading pairs, including ENA/BTC, ENA/USDT, ENA/BNB, ENA/FDUSD, and ENA/TRY.
Ethena to Airdrop 750 Million ENA to Early Adopters
Meanwhile, the introduction of Ethena to Binance Launchpool coincides with the protocol planned website launch later today, on March 29, 2024. The platform also plans to reward users for their contributions to the network since launch.
Ethena Labs, the brains behind the network’s development, recently announced that it would airdrop 750 million ENA to users holding “shards”, which represent their engagement with the protocol.
The planned airdrop accounts for 5% of the total ENA supply. However, the number of tokens each user receives will depend on the shards accumulated by April 1.
To be eligible for the airdrop, users must ensure that their USDe, the protocol’s synthetic dollar pegged to the US dollar, is staked or held within the Ethena protocol. Eligible participants can expect to receive their ENA tokens on April 2, which will be available for trading on crypto exchanges such as Binance.

Fake Ethena Labs token exploited for $290K on Binance Launchpool

Update March 29, 09:50 am UTC: This article has been updated to clarify the token in question is a fake bearing the same name as Ethena Labs' ENA token.A fake token with the same name as Ethena Labs's ENA token has been exploited for 480 BNB (BNB) tokens worth $290,000 on the Binance launch pool for farming. The vulnerability behind the exploit is still unknown. On-chain security firm PeckShield reported the incident at 8:31 am UTC on March 29 in an X post, mistaking the fake token for the real ENA token.Ethena Labs’s ENA token was announced on the Binance Launchpool on March 29. The exploit of the fake token, which is unrelated to Ethena Labs, occurred a few hours after the announcementing listing, causing widespread confusion.Ethena Labs launched its USDe synthetic dollar on the public mainnet on Feb. 19. Ethena became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8, when it offered investors an annual percentage yield (APY) of 67%. In terms of total sum, the exploit is on the smaller side of crypto hacks. The attack occurred a day after the over-$11-million Prisma Finance hack on March 28.Crypto hacks are a long-standing issue in the industry, eroding investor trust. Over $200 million worth of crypto has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 2024 across 32 individual incidents up to Feb. 29, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi.The over-$200-million loss represents a 15.4% increase compared to January and February 2023, when $173 million of digital assets were stolen.A total of $1.8 billion was lost to crypto hacks and scammers in 2023, 17% of which can be attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, according to a Dec. 28 report by Immunefi.Related: Funds hacked in 2024 increased by 15.4% vs. the same period in 2023 — ImmunefiAmount of crypto funds stolen fell 54% in 2023The biggest year for crypto hackers was 2022, which saw over $3.7 billion in funds stpo, a decrease of 54.3% to $1.7 billion in 2023, according to the “2024 Crypto Crime Report” by Chainalysis.Despite the value of funds falling, the number of incidents grew from 219 in 2022 to 231 in 2023.Total value hacked. Source: ChainalysisChainalysis attributed the significant yearly drop to a decrease in decentralized finance (DeFi) hacking, according to the report:“Hacks of DeFi protocols largely drove the huge increase in stolen crypto that we saw in 2021 and 2022, with cybercriminals stealing more than $3.1 billion in DeFi hacks last year. But this year, hackers stole just $1.1 billion from DeFi protocols. This amounts to a 63.7% drop in the total value stolen from DeFi platforms year-over-year.”Related: Marc Andreessen, Galaxy Digital, Accolade, back new $75 million crypto fund: Report

                        Brazilian exchange operator B3 has received approval from the country’s securities regulator to introduce Bitcoin futures trading. On Thursday, the platform said the Bitcoin futures trading is scheduled to commence on April 17, according to a report from Reuters. Currently, B3 offers exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETF receipts related to cryptoassets. With the addition of Bitcoin futures, the exchange aims to meet the growing demand for derivatives that provide a hedge against price fluctuations or directional exposure to the popular cryptocurrency.B3’s Bitcoin Futures Will be Tied to Nasdaq
The Bitcoin futures contracts offered by B3 will be tied to the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price, with each contract representing 10% of Bitcoin’s price in Brazilian reais. It is important to note that these futures contracts will involve financial settlement, meaning there will be no actual buying or selling of physical bitcoin.“The launch meets the demand for a derivative that allows a hedge against bitcoin’s price fluctuations or a directional exposure to the asset,” Felipe Goncalves, B3’s superintendent of swap rates and currency products, said. He said that the move by B3 signifies a significant step in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial market of Brazil. By offering Bitcoin futures, B3 provides investors with a regulated and secure platform to participate in Bitcoin trading, leveraging the price movements of the digital asset.Brazil Warming Towards Digital Assets
Brazil has been moving toward digital assets and innovative technologies like blockchain. Last year, the country announced it is set to issue digital identification documents for its more than 214 million citizens using blockchain technology.The decision to leverage blockchain technology for digital identity stems from its inherent properties of immutability and decentralization. Alexandre Amorim, president of Serpro, said that blockchain technology is crucial for protecting personal data and preventing fraud. He claimed that the b-Cadastros blockchain platform significantly enhances the security and reliability of the National Identity Card project, offering a more secure digital experience for Brazilian citizens. In addition to the digital identity project, Brazil is also making strides in the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In August, the government provided more details about the project, which has been rebranded as Drex. The CBDC aims to expand business access to capital through a tokenization system associated with the Drex. More recently, the central bank of Brazil vowed to tighten rules and strengthen its oversight of crypto platforms amid growing crypto adoption in the country.Roberto Campos Neto, the governor of Brazil’s central bank, said last October that “cryptocurrency imports” by Brazilian residents have risen 44.2% in the period between January and August 2023 compared to the same period last year.“We understand that a lot is connected to tax evasion or linked to illicit activities,” Neto said while stressing that oversight of the crypto sector in Brazil will be strengthened going forward.

Driving Cats NFT Club Drop Begins in Challenge to SHIB, BONK, PEPE and DOGE



                    
The first phase of the Driving Cats NFT Club public sale got underway on 29 March at 8:30 AM (GMT) on OpenSea. 



Cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bonk (BONK) and Pepecoin (PEPE) have been attracting huge inflows from retail investors in recent weeks and months, amid the beginning of the bull run. 




While these altcoins can deliver significant returns during the current cycle – potentially over 200% – investing in NFTs at the beginning of the drop can potentially generate even higher returns, in a much shorter period of time.



One such opportunity that has emerged is the Driving Cats NFT Club (DCNC.)



The first phase of the public sale of the Driving Cats NFT Club started today at 8:30 AM (GMT), and investors can now buy and mint their NFT from this collection. 



During the first phase, each of the 999 NFTs that make up this collection will be available to buy for just 0.07 ETH (around $240).



Once the first phase of the public sale ends in late April, each NFT will be priced at 0.25 ETH – over four times its price during the first phase.



However, as the NFT collection is expected to sell out during the first phase, and as most buyers will likely hold onto their NFTs rather than trying to flip them in the secondary market, the price of each NFT could rally much higher than 0.25 ETH.




For investors who buy and mint their NFT during the first phase of the public sale, the Driving Cats NFT Club could be a great investment, potentially delivering much higher returns than if you were to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepecoin (PEPE), or Bonk (BONK).

WIF, DOGE, SHIB Lead Memecoin Gains as Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Warn of Pullback

“The price rally has been exponential in Q1, and there are signs of exhaustion,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast Friday. “ETH risk reversals are skewed to the downside at -8%, indicating some fear. Funding and forwards remain very elevated, which means that speculators are still paying high prices to keep their leveraged longs.”

Bitcoin shows ‘signs of exhaustion’ as Q1 BTC price gains near 70%

Bitcoin (BTC) risks “exhaustion” as it nears the end of Q1 2024 with 65% BTC price gains.In an update sent to Telegram channel subscribers on March 29, trading firm QCP Capital warned that “exponential” upside could pose a problem next quarter.BTC price slows after “exponential” Q1Bitcoin market observers are firmly focused on the weekend as several key candles — the weekly, monthly and quarterly — close at once.After a transformational start to the year, BTC price action continues to hover around all-time highs while still facing difficulty flipping them to new support.For QCP Capital, the outlook for the second quarter nonetheless remains “very bullish.” It summarized:“For Q2, there are sufficient catalysts to form a very bullish view:1. Continued BTC spot ETF demand (and shrinking supply as GBTC runs out)2. BTC halving3. London Stock Exchange ETNs4. Potential ETH spot ETF approval.”Despite this, the extent of progress since the start of the year — including the launch of the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January — has been such that bulls may have problems continuing that momentum.“At the same time, the price rally has been exponential in Q1 and there are signs of exhaustion,” QCP explained.It flagged declining sentiment on the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), and persistent high funding rates across exchanges.“While we remain bullish, we are cautious about leverage and we are also prepared to scoop some value on big dips,” the update concluded.Bitcoin monthly chart looks to match recordThe latest live data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, TradingView and monitoring resource CoinGlass confirms that BTC/USD is 65.4% year-to-date.Related: Bitcoin ‘sell-side liquidity crisis’ sees BTC move for the first time since 2010BTC/USD quarterly returns (screenshot).

Hackers Swipe Bitcoin from Unwitting Call of Duty Cheaters


In a striking turn of events, gamers, particularly those bending the rules in Call of Duty, find themselves in the crosshairs of a sophisticated malware campaign. 
An unknown threat actor deployed this malware. It targets users of pay-to-cheat services in games. This leads to unauthorized transactions and compromised accounts.
Activision Blizzard Teams Up with Cheat Makers to Battle Malware Theft
The initial alarm was raised by a Call of Duty cheat provider, PhantomOverlay, upon noticing unauthorized purchases on user accounts. This discovery quickly unraveled a wider web of compromised accounts across various gaming platforms, including Battlenet and Activision, with over 3.6 million and 561,183 accounts affected, respectively.

“The scope of the impact is so large, and in a bizarre twist of fate, Activision Blizzard is coordinating with cheat providers to aid users impacted by the massive infostealer campaign.” Stated vx-underground.

This cyber-attack doesn’t stop at gaming credentials. Impacted users report significant losses from their Electrum Bitcoin wallets, adding a financial sting to the breach. The exact amount siphoned off remains unclear, but the implications are alarming, underscoring the vulnerabilities associated with illicit gaming practices and third-party tools.

In an unexpected collaboration, gaming behemoth Activision Blizzard is joining forces with cheat providers like PhantomOverlay to assist users caught in this malware incident. This partnership aims to identify and remediate affected accounts, shedding light on the scale and sophistication of the infostealer campaign.
Zeebler, a developer of cheating software for Call of Duty, initially made the discovery of this malware campaign. Zeebler revealed in PhantomOverlay’s channel the hackers’ tactic. They target gamers, even cheat users, to steal usernames and passwords. Alarmingly, they also aim to take their cryptocurrency assets.
Activision has responded to the crisis, with spokesperson Delaney Simmons asserting that the company’s servers remain “secure and uncompromised.” The focus now shifts to understanding the malware’s propagation methods, which remain ambiguous but seem to involve the download or use of unauthorized software.

This malware incident warns gamers about the dangers of cheating and using third-party tools. As the probe continues, gamers eagerly await measures to combat this threat. They want to protect their digital and financial assets.

Analysis of the cryptocurrencies Ondo, Patex, and Bonk

In this historical period there are some cryptocurrencies whose prices are performing in a particularly unique way: we are talking about Ondo, Patex and Bonk.

Latest crypto news at Ondo, Patex, and Bonk prices
Ondo is one of the most interesting cryptos at the moment. 
ONDO is the Ethereum token of Ondo DAO, and grants specific rights in Flux Finance.
The Ondo Finance project is related to the tokenization of real assets (RWA, Real World Asset), which is one of the fastest growing sectors within the crypto world.
Around it, Flux Finance is a platform that allows loans in stablecoin collateralized in tokenized US bonds. 
The Ondo token made its debut on the crypto markets only at the beginning of 2024, so there is little historical data to analyze. Furthermore, the project’s platforms have not yet had time to prove themselves to be solid and long-lasting.
Nevertheless, in less than three months the price of Ondo has risen from the initial $0.17 to the current $0.88, with a gain of 415%.
The all-time high was reached three days ago at almost $1, but if the current medium-term trend continues, it is possible that it will be updated in the coming weeks. 
However, it is necessary to pay close attention to this project, because there is a possibility that RWAs may be considered securities in financial markets, and in that case they could not be freely traded on platforms that are not specifically registered and authorized to deal with securities. 
Furthermore, giants like BlackRock are also entering the RWA sector, which do not have authorization problems, so the competition could be significant. 
However, throughout the duration of the bullrun, it is possible to ride the wave of tokens linked to RWAs, even if it is primarily just propaganda. 
Therefore, the doubt is not so much about short-term resistance, but about long-term resistance, since the RWA sector is just beginning, and it will presumably take some more time before giants like BlackRock fully appropriate it.
The trend of Patex 
Patex is also a token on Ethereum, and this token has also debuted on the crypto markets only this year.
This is always a project related to RWAs, so the same considerations just made for Ondo apply. 
The price trend of Patex on the crypto markets, however, is decidedly different. 
While Ondo debuted at a very low price, and then has almost done nothing but rise, Patex instead debuted at prices in line with current ones.
But after all, it landed on the crypto markets less than three weeks ago, so it could still be only in its initial phase.
The debut was made at around $6.5, with a first peak at $9.7, a subsequent drop below $5, and a rise up to the current $7.3. 
It is therefore a fairly volatile token, more than Ondo, which has not yet really taken off on the crypto markets. 
The Patex project is specifically targeting the Latin American market, and includes an ecosystem of tools that should enable the tokenization and exchange of RWA. 
At this moment it is very difficult to say how solid this project really is, and what concrete potential it has, besides the fact that the crypto sector of RWA seems to be currently dominated by Ondo. 
The trend of Bonk 
Bonk instead has nothing to do with RWA, because it is a memecoin on Solana. 
The token made its debut on the crypto markets at the end of 2022, so it has been traded for almost a year and a half. 
The initial debut took place at very low prices, but this is a typical characteristic of memecoins, which usually perform very poorly until the moment of the boom. 
The price of Bonk tends to enter a bull run at the end of the year, in view of Christmas, since its project revolves around this event. 
Indeed, by the end of 2022 it had already recorded a first boom with a spectacular +3,000% in just a few weeks. 
However, he had then lost a large part of those earnings, only to repeat themselves at the end of 2023. 
Indeed, starting from mid-October the price started to rise again, going from 0.2 millionths of a dollar to 25 millionths in about two months. The gain was 12,000%. 
As often happens in these cases, it was a speculative bubble that burst at the beginning of 2024, but the price did not drop much below 10 millionths of a dollar. 
In March, a new speculative bubble inflated, leading to new all-time highs above 45 million dollars. Now it has dropped back to 27 million, but it is not possible to completely exclude the possibility of new bubbles inflating. 
It is worth noting that, despite the three sensational booms, its market capitalization is still less than 1.8 billion dollars, while other longer-standing memecoins, such as Shiba Inu, have a market capitalization even ten times higher. 
So the potential for some new bubble seems to be there, even if not with gains similar to those of the past.

Vitalik Buterin Fires Shots at Crypto Villains


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has ignited a firestorm in the crypto world with his recent social media post, taking aim at what he calls "crypto villains." In an unexpected move, Buterin singled out figures like Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, labeling them as emblematic of a darker side of the industry.In his post, Buterin mentions Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, two famous "crypto villains." The former is known for having purchased the infamous Mt. Gox exchange in 2011, in 2014 it went bankrupt, and in 2015 Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese police. As a result, he was under investigation for the next four years.Davies co-founded the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which collapsed in 2022 after failing to meet its multi-billion dollar obligations. The fund's bankruptcy set off a chain reaction that is believed to have gotten to FTX, which eventually collapsed later that year. Interestingly, Buterin believes that while Karpeles deserves a chance at forgiveness due to his current activities, Davies does not. The screenshots attached to the post by the Ethereum founder make it clear what he dislikes — it is the fact that Davies, after losing billions and ruining a lot of people's lives, continues to post his meme cryptocurrency deals and generally engage in cheap attention-grabbing activities.This comes hot on the heels of the imprisonment of another notable figure in the crypto sphere, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX exchange, who was sentenced to 25 years behind bars. FTX, once a titan in the crypto exchange arena, faced insolvency following revelations of financial instability and subsequent investor withdrawals.

Please reach out to HKVAEX."Three other virtual asset trading platforms have withdrawn their operational license applications in 2024 for reasons that were not made public, including the prominent global crypto exchange Huobi.Crypto Twitter community member Wu Blockchain speculated that the reasons for the withdrawal may involve a variety of reasons, including a request to change the audit company or provide more information. At the time of its launch, HKVAEX was confused with VAEX, a different crypto exchange in Hong Kong tied to KuCoin. At the time, an HKVAEX representative told Cointelegraph, “VAEXC is another applicant, and they have nothing to do with us.”Related: Binance executive reportedly escapes detention as Nigeria files tax evasion chargesCommEx, a Russian crypto exchange with strong ties with Binance, officially announced it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits on March 25.“We have to announce the gradual suspension of operations on the CommEX platform,” the firm said, recommending users to withdraw their assets immediately to third-party wallets.Binance had previously hinted at exiting Russia in early September 2023 as top local executives, including vice president of Eastern Europe Gleb Kostarev, stepped down. Subsequently, CommEx emphasized that it operated independently of Binance but admitted that some of its core members were former Binance staff.Magazine: Creating ‘good’ AGI that won’t kill us all: Crypto’s Artificial Superintelligence Alliance

Tezos Blockchain: the proposals of the Paris protocol

After the successful activation of the Oxford 2 protocol on February 9th, the Tezos Blockchain community is once again buzzing. 
This time it’s about the proposals of the Paris protocol – Paris A and Paris B – which each promise significant advancements to the Tezos protocol. 
These proposals, identified by their hash keys, aim to introduce lower latency, faster finality, and crucial updates to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. 
Let’s delve into the complexity of these proposals and their significance for the future of Tezos.

Updates and important improvements of the Tezos blockchain
Both Paris A and Paris B offer substantial improvements to the Tezos protocol, including:
Lower latency and higher speed: By reducing block times to just 10 seconds, both proposals aim to improve transaction speed and network efficiency without compromising decentralization or security.
Activation of the Data Availability Layer (DAL): The introduction of DAL on Mainnet is set to revolutionize scalability, benefiting especially Smart Rollups like Etherlink, significantly increasing throughput and bandwidth.
Refinement of Tezos PoS: Both proposals include enhancements to Tezos PoS, with the aim of simplifying the acquisition and updating of baking rights, while also simplifying the calculation.
Paris B introduces Adaptive Issuance, Staking and Adaptive Slashing immediately after the activation of the protocol. These features represent a significant revision of the Tezos PoS mechanism, adapting it to real-world use and improving the security of the chain.
Paris A, instead, provides the possibility for bakers to vote for the activation of these features at a later time through a signaling mechanism on the chain. This mechanism allows for a more gradual adoption process, allowing bakers to assess the impact of these features before implementation.
Main features
Adaptive issuance: This mechanism regulates the issuance of tez by the protocol based on the ratio between the tez staked and the total supply, incentivizing participants to stake funds to maintain a target ratio defined by the protocol.
Episode: The proposals from Paris introduce a new role – the staker – which allows participants to contribute to a baker’s security deposit without giving up custody of their funds. The deposited funds are subject to slashing in case of misconduct.
Adaptive Slashing: this function enhances the slashing mechanism to distinguish between innocent errors and deliberate attacks, ensuring fair penalties based on the total stake of the attester.
Paris A offers a more deliberative approach, allowing the activation of the function through a voting mechanism. Paris B, on the other hand, activates Adaptive Issuance, Staking, and Adaptive Slashing immediately upon protocol activation, providing a faster implementation path.
Both proposals from Paris include further enhancements to Tezos’ PoS, independent from Adaptive Issuance, Staking, and Adaptive Slashing.
These changes simplify the calculation of batch rights and reduce various delays and grace periods, thus optimizing the efficiency of the network.
Conclusions
The proposals of the Paris protocol mark an exciting chapter in the evolution of the Tezos blockchain. With innovations aimed at improving speed, scalability, and security, Tezos continues to consolidate its position as a leading blockchain platform.
Whether it’s the gradual adoption offered by Paris A or the immediate implementation of Paris B, the future looks promising for Tezos and its vibrant community.
While we eagerly await the outcome of these proposals, we continue to collaborate and build together a brighter future for Tezos. 
Join the conversation on Tezos Discord and stay tuned for further updates in the #baking-announcements channel. The journey ahead of us is full of possibilities and together we can shape the next phase of Tezos’ journey.

                        TRM Labs data revealed that 2023 saw illicit crypto volumes drop by a third from $49.5 billion in 2022 to $34.8 billion. However, of all crypto frauds in 2023, TRON blockchain hosted 45%, up from 41% in 2022.A new report from TRM’s blockchain intelligence team highlighted key trends in crypto illicit transactions through 2023.Criminals have handled over $34 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, despite 9% decrease in year-on-year total illicit crypto funds from 2022-2023.The report titled “The Illicit Crypto Economy,” also noted that almost half of all illicit crypto volume (45% in 2023) occurred on the TRON blockchain. This was followed by Ethereum blockchain at 24% and Bitcoin blockchain with 18%.Further, Tether (USDT) stablecoin has seen the largest illicit volume last year, at $19.3 billion. “Approximately 1.63% of Tether volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,” it noted.When asked about the factors that make TRON blockchain a potential hotbed for perpetrators, Angela Ang, senior policy advisor at TRM told Cryptonews that “one of the reasons for TRON’s popularity could be its low transaction fees and high speed.” This makes it cheap and quick to launder funds, she added.“The availability of stablecoins like USDT on TRON could be another factor. For example, we know that USDT on TRON is the currency of choice for terrorist financing entities.”2023 Observed Crypto Crime Reductions
While the damage on TRON blockchain was massive, 2023 witnessed a significant decline in the volume of illicit funds. There was a 30% decrease than the $49.5 billion recorded in 2022.Also, sanctions volume was the largest driver of the overall decline last year. Crypto value linked to sanctioned entities fell 30% from $25.4 billion in 2022 to $16.2 billion in 2023. Source: TRMAdditionally, crypto hacks and exploits saw a dramatic 50% reduction to $1.8 billion in 2023 from $3.7 billion in 2022. On an average, every hack in 2023 saw $10 million compromised, against $21 million in 2022, it added.“Many factors are likely to have contributed to the dent in crypto crime over 2023, including increased vigilance from businesses, fraud awareness among the general public, and pure chance,” the report read.

Top Judges' Cryptocurrency Portfolio Revealed: They Hold Bitcoin and These Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi

South Korea, which came to the fore with its parliamentarian's suspicious cryptocurrency transactions, has now come to the fore with the cryptocurrency assets of senior judges.
According to reports from local news agency NoCut News and Joongang Ilbo, it was revealed that some senior South Korean judges hold popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL).


The information came to light after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that senior judges must make annual public disclosures about their financial assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
According to the court decision, the statements that judges must provide must also include the assets and crypto wallet information of their spouses and children.





Accordingly, Cheongju District Court Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol said that he held 9.92 and 3.38 BTC, while his wife and son held a total of 6.54 BTC in their names.
Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol stated that apart from Bitcoin, he holds small amounts of Ethereum, Solana and XRP.


Additionally, Kang Il-won, Chairman of the Supreme Court Public Service Ethics Committee, disclosed the assets of 141 high-ranking judges, including Chief Justice Cho Hee-dae and Supreme Court Justices, including cryptocurrencies.
Cheongju District Court Chief Judge Lim Byeong-ryeol reported that he held 3.38 Bitcoins (192.34 million KRW) in his name, while his wife and son held 519.68 million KRW and 1.05 million KRW worth of cryptocurrencies, respectively.

Rapid rise and fall of Memecoins amidst SBF's sentencing

In a whirlwind of speculative fervor, the cryptocurrency community witnessed a fierce surge in memecoins coinciding with the historic sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX. Judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision to impose a 25-year prison sentence on Bankman-Fried sent shockwaves through the industry, marking a significant milestone as the first prison sentence for an individual linked to the collapse of a major cryptocurrency exchange.Within hours of the sentencing, a memecoin titled “Sam Baseman Fraud” emerged on the Coinbase layer-2 network Base, amusingly adopting the ticker symbol “FTX.” This tongue-in-cheek nod to Bankman-Fried’s legal woes quickly captured the attention of speculative investors. The memecoin skyrocketed by an astounding 23,300%, reaching a peak market capitalization of $1.5 million on March 28, according to DexScreener data.However, the euphoria proved short-lived as the token rapidly shed more than 85% of its value within three hours, exemplifying the volatile nature of memecoin investments. Despite a subsequent stabilization, with the token trading around the $0.06 mark, it remained substantially below its all-time highs, reflecting a 60% decrease.Solana-based SBF memecoin surges In a parallel development, the Solana network witnessed the launch of another memecoin, dubbed “Som Bonkmon Fraud,” also themed around Sam Bankman-Fried. Initially, this token surged to a market capitalization of approximately $20 million, representing an astonishing 18,000% increase from its launch value of $30,000.Nevertheless, mirroring the fate of its counterpart, the SBF memecoin experienced a steep decline, plummeting over 95% from its peak. As of the latest update, the token trades around $0.0008, only marginally above its initial listing price, underscoring the speculative nature and inherent risks associated with memecoin investments.The emergence of Bankman-Fried-themed memecoins adds to a growing trend of memecoins inspired by crypto and political figureheads. With the upcoming United States election looming, several political memecoins, including Boden and Tremp, have sought to capitalize on the heightened attention surrounding political events.The resurgence of memecoins gained momentum following the meteoric rise of Dog Wif Hat (WIF). This Solana-based memecoin soared from a market capitalization of approximately $50,000 to $3.5 billion within four months. Other meme tokens, such as the frog-themed Pepe on Ethereum and the rooster-themed Coq Inu (COQ) on Avalanche, have experienced notable rallies.FTT token dips amidst legal turmoilThe fallout from Bankman-Fried’s sentencing reverberated across the cryptocurrency market, impacting not only memecoins but also established tokens. FTX Token (FTT), the native cryptocurrency of the now-defunct exchange, witnessed a significant decline of more than 16% following the news of Bankman-Fried’s legal troubles, per CoinGecko data.

Wyckoff 'SOS' Could Catapult Bitcoin To $100,000: Fund Manager


                            Charles Edwards, founder of the Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, published a detailed examination of Bitcoin’s current market phase suggesting a bullish trajectory, potentially reaching the $100,000 mark. The analysis hinges on the identification of a Wyckoff ‘Sign of Strength’ (SOS), a concept derived from the century-old Wyckoff Method that studies supply and demand dynamics to forecast price movements.
Understanding The Wyckoff ‘SOS’: Bitcoin To $100,000?
The Wyckoff Method, developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, is a framework for understanding market structures and predicting future price movements through the analysis of price action, volume, and time. The ‘Sign of Strength’ (SOS) within this methodology signifies a point where the market shows evidence of demand overpowering supply, indicating a strong bullish outlook.
Edwards’s observation of an SOS pattern in Bitcoin’s recent price movements suggests that the market is at a pivotal point, where sustained upward momentum is highly probable. In Capriole’s latest newsletter, Edwards offered a precise depiction of Bitcoin’s market behavior, highlighting a period of volatility and consolidation in the $60,000 to $70,000 range.

This phase was anticipated by the hedge fund. Currently, as Bitcoin ventures above its last cycle’s all-time highs, it aligns with the predicted zig-zag SOS structure. Edwards elucidates, “It would not be surprising to see a liquidity grab at / into all-time highs […] All consolidation above the Monthly level at $56K is extremely bullish. It would be uncommon (but not impossible) for price to continue in a straight line up.”
The “zig-zag” phase also perfectly aligns with the halving cycle as BTC tends to consolidate “both months either side of the Halving.” Edwards added that “the realities of a much lower supply growth rate + unlocked pent up tradfi demand will then kick-in and launch 12 months of historically the best risk-reward period for Bitcoin.”
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s foray into price discovery territory above $70,000 is devoid of significant resistance levels. This opens a pathway to psychological and Fibonacci extension levels, with Edwards pinpointing $100,000 as the next major psychological resistance.

The 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the 2021 high to the 2022 low is noted at $101,750, serving as a technical marker for potential resistance. Edwards reflects on investor sentiment, stating, “You can also imagine quite a few investors would be happy seeing six-digit Bitcoin and taking profit in that zone,” acknowledging the psychological impact of such milestones.

BTC Fundamentals Support The Bull Case
Edwards also delves into the importance of fundamentals, underscoring their role in providing a bullish backdrop for Bitcoin. The introduction of the Dynamic Range NVT (DRNVT), a unique metric to Capriole, indicates that Bitcoin is currently undervalued. Edwards describes DRNVT as “Bitcoin’s ‘PE Ratio'”, which assesses the network’s value by comparing on-chain transaction throughput to market capitalization.
The current DRNVT readings suggest an attractive investment opportunity, given Bitcoin’s undervaluation at all-time price highs. “What’s fascinating at this point of the cycle is that DRNVT is currently in a value zone. With price at all time highs, this is a promising and unusual reading for the opportunity that lies ahead in 2024. It’s something we didn’t see in 2016 nor 2020,” Edwards remarked.

With both technical indicators and fundamental analysis signaling a bullish future for Bitcoin, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Halving event adds further momentum to the positive outlook. Despite the expectation of volatility and consolidation in the short term, Edwards confidently states, “probabilities are starting to skew to the upside once again.”
At press time, BTC traded at $69,981.

SBF Is Going to Prison for 25 Years

With trial by combat out of the question (at least, for now), Bankman-Fried will have to serve his time the old-fashioned way. Kaplan did take his autism diagnosis and gentle nature into account in one regard – he recommended that Bankman-Fried be placed in a medium or low-security federal prison, preferably one that’s close to San Francisco, where his parents live, arguing that his autism, notoriety, and perceived wealth would make him vulnerable in a maximum security facility.

X Payments To Launch Without Crypto


							

X Payments debuts without crypto, only securing a Money Transmitter License in Louisiana.



Major firms like PayPal and Coinbase comply with Virtual Currency License requirements, unlike X Payments.



New York’s strict crypto license rules impact X Payments’ strategy, reflecting Musk’s regulatory concerns.




In the development of the digital payment industry, X Payments, a new venture by the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), is set to make its debut without cryptocurrency integration. Acquired and rebranded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, X Payments recently received a key Check Sales and Money Transmitters license in Louisiana. 



However, the company’s absence of a Virtual Currency Business License, crucial for crypto asset transactions, signals a delay. This indicates that digital currencies like Dogecoin and others may not be embraced at its inception.



Notably, Louisiana and states like New York require firms engaging in crypto-related activities to obtain a specific Virtual Currency Business License. This requirement has been met by major players such as Robinhood, PayPal, Coinbase, and eToro.



Essential for operations involving virtual assets, this license has not been sought by X Payments, as indicated by the sole issuance of the Money Transmitter License. Consequently, the lack of application for the necessary virtual currency permissions underscores a decision to exclude cryptocurrency payments from its platform initially.



Further insight into the company’s regulatory strategy emerges from the situation in New York, a state known for its stringent licensing requirements for virtual currency businesses. According to a report from BitcoinSistemi, the New York State Department of Financial Services confirmed that X Payments has not applied for a virtual currency license. 



This move aligns with Musk’s previous comments on the challenges of obtaining approval in states like New York and California. Although X Payments has reportedly sought Money Transmitter Licenses in these jurisdictions, the omission of virtual currency licenses suggests a cautious approach to integrating cryptocurrencies.

UAE research showcases challenges facing Blockchain implementation in UAE banking sector | Cryptopolitan

The UAE based ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) Academy research Centre alongside the College of Business and Economics at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEEU) carried out a research project entitled, “Digital Transformation of banking and financial institutions in the UAE: Understanding the common challenges for collective action” aimed at understanding the current landscape of the digital transformation of banking and financial institutions in the UAE.The results of the research clearly showcase that the UAE banking sector is apprehensive and mostly not enthusiastic about utilizing blockchain technology. The reasons are many, ranging from technical, regulatory and even talent challenges.The research was supported by senior representatives from across the UAE’s financial sector, who shared their insights via interviews conducted by the research team.While the research covered an array of technologies, and the digitization history and movement within the UAE, there was a specific section on Blockchain.Benefits of BlockchainInterviewees did identify the benefits of blockchain, which according to them facilitated the recording and verification of transactions and their authentication.The research report also noted that blockchain technology increases the confidentiality and trust for transactions and tracks assets they noted that hybrid systems (blockchain technology and non-blockchain systems) will still be used for the foreseeable future.Blockchain technology has many other benefits including increased speed of transactions, and reduction in costs and reduced risks because of its tamper proof nature and transparency. So, it is a welcome solution for businesses and customers.As per the research, blockchain contributes as well to cross border payment, KYC and digital currencies. It states, “It can revolutionize the financial services sector in the UAE by streamlining processes and increasing efficiency and transparency while reducing time and costs. These benefits can lead to increased trust in the financial system as trust is a critical factor in financial decision-making globally.”UAE Banks and BlockchainWhen it came to the research on how ready UAE Banks are for Blockchain, the researchers revealed that both the UAE government and the Central Bank of UAE have supported blockchain initiatives. Yet the technology has only been utilized in some functions in the financial sector.However, there is no clear indication of how ready the UAE financial and banking system is to move financial statements into a distributed and consensus-driven ledger.Despite this, interviewees in the report believe that the UAE is an ideal location to leverage the benefits of Blockchain in the financial services and banking sector. Tech ChallengesYet some interviewees believe that most banks have not adopted blockchain because of the technology challenges facing blockchain.There is an opinion that banks will not move solely to blockchain. They believe that many banks are still considering moving financial statements into a distributed and consensus-driven ledger. The reason is that they need more time to be ready with the IT infrastructure required to build the blockchain-enabled ecosystem.Despite the view by some that blockchain can generate greater trust in products and services, it was identified that there is a need for more confidence in blockchain itself. The use cases are scattered so finding the proper use case can also be problematic.Furthermore, cyber security remains a challenge as well as implementing complex IT infrastructure-related blockchain technology in multi-cloud ecosystems.In addition, others believe that the UAE needs to implement a standard protocol among different financial institutions on how to use blockchain. Some replies stated, “Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem to solve.” The opinion exists that there is no universal case for why the UAE needs blockchain and whether it has the skills, technologies, vendors, and partners to implement it.The report stipulated that there are two opposing views on the status of blockchain adoption in the UAE. This is in line with global studies. OMFIF (Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum) indicated that 72% of central banks are unsure that blockchain will be used in future payment systems.Respondents believe it takes time and is costly to transform the existing system. Secondly a standard protocol for operations is not present. Blockchain is also resource hungry.Some interviewees also experienced integrating blockchain into the traditional fiat money systems managed by governments as a considerable challenge.There are also skills gap. Some replies explained that blockchain increases the level of complexity in banking, requiring greater skill levels that are already in short supply.Regulatory challengesAnother challenge mentioned by interviewees was the lack of a unified regulatory framework making cross border transactions difficult.As per the research, “Some banks perceive a need for a regulatory framework at the CBUAE for blockchain.”From a governance perspective, some banks believe compliance and legal could be more blockchain-friendly.ConclusionWhile Blockchain has always looked to be a promising technology for the financial and payments sector, it is still facing resistance, even in the UAE which has been a vanguard for blockchain and advanced technology implementations.Addressing the concerns mentioned in this study should help propel Blockchain further within the banking sector.

Google’s inclusion of Bitcoin wallet balances sparks privacy debate

Google has expanded its features to allow users to search wallet balances across multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon and Fantom. When entering the wallet address, search results display the token balance by network along with the last updated time.Users can search three Bitcoin address formats — P2PKH, P2SH and Bech32 — and view current balances and recent transactions. Incorporating Bitcoin data into search results boosts Google’s accessibility to on-chain activity, leveraging its extensive daily search volume. While some praise Google’s new feature as a move toward mainstream adoption, privacy-centric Bitcoin supporters have raised concerns about centralized data aggregation and its impact on privacy.An example of a Google Bitcoin wallet search. Source: GoogleGoogle’s latest feature comes after it introduced Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain search results, allowing users to check wallet balances with readable domain names like “vitalik.eth” for Ethereum wallet addresses. Google’s recent expansion builds on its initial introduction of Ethereum wallet balance searches in May 2023. In 2022, Google integrated a crypto feature enabling some Ethereum wallet addresses to have their Ether (ETH) balances tracked by the Google search engine, saving the need to make the trip to Etherscan.Related: Amazon takes minority share in ChatGPT rival Anthropic AIThe addition of wallet searches marks a shift in the tech giant’s attitude. Google prohibited Bitcoin-related advertisements in 2018 but recently reversed its stance, allowing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) advertisements following their approval in the United States in January.ETF products from notable asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results.In October 2022, Google partnered with Coinbase to allow its customers to pay for cloud services with crypto. The tech firm also initiated a countdown to the Ethereum Merge event — Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022 — by featuring animated pandas moving in sync.In 2023, Google Cloud joined forces with Web3 startup Orderly Network to create user-centric developer tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) to lower the barrier of entry into the decentralized world. The collaboration aimed to address DeFi’s major hurdles: entry barriers and security issues, which have been long-standing challenges in the ecosystem.Magazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3 — Tony Pearce’s journey in time and space

Within a span of just 14 hours, transactions amounting to 1.4 trillion SHIB have been recorded, which raises some questions: Why are whales moving so much SHIB and can it affect its market price?Transaction logs show a sequence of movements that catch the eye — notably from major exchange hot wallets like Coinbase and Binance. These platforms are central to the crypto trade, and their hot wallets are instrumental for immediate transactions.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor example, one transaction from a Coinbase hot wallet moved 36.3 billion SHIB, valued at approximately $1.03 million, considering the token's price at the time was around $0.0000284.The timing of these large-scale movements coincides with an explosive rally on the Shiba Inu chart. As for now, Shiba Inu is moving in the uptrend, as suggested by the movement above crucial moving averages.The reasons behind these whale movements can be manifold. Some investors might be reallocating their holdings in anticipation of market events or potential news that could affect SHIB's valuation. Others might be taking profits after the recent price surge or redistributing their assets for strategic diversification. The significant transfer activity could also be preparatory, setting the stage for a larger market play.The impact of these whale moves can be quite noticeable, often hinting at heightened price volatility. Market sentiment can swing, and prices can sharply rise or fall in response to such large-scale transfers. For SHIB, which stays and moves in an uptrend, peaking at $0.00003083, these transactions may be of a new market trend.However, one should most certainly stay cautious; while these signals may hint at impending market movements, they do not always lead to immediate or predictable outcomes.

Everything Vitalik Buterin Said About Ethereum's Future


Vitalik Buterin sheds light on how the Dencun hard fork improved the blockchain’s scaling and efficiency. 
Indeed, proto-danksharding marks a significant shift, reducing transaction fees for rollups by a staggering factor of over 100. According to Ethereum’s co-founder, this development paves the way for a more scalable, cost-efficient ecosystem. It addresses long-standing concerns about blockchain bloat and high fees.
Why Ethereum’s Future Looks Bright, According to Vitalik Buterin
The Dencun hard fork signifies a pivotal transition for Ethereum. The blockchain’s shift towards a Layer 2 (L2)-centric ecosystem reflects a forward-thinking approach to decentralization, with major applications transitioning from Layer 1 (L1) to L2. 
This transition reimagines Ethereum’s infrastructure to support a broader range of applications and improve user experience across the board.
Vitalik Buterin emphasizes the importance of separate data availability space. This is a novel concept that allows L2 projects like rollups to store data in a section of a block inaccessible by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The new mechanism enables data to be broadcasted and verified separately from the block.
Therefore, it lays the groundwork for future scalability through data availability sampling. This method promises to dramatically expand Ethereum’s data capacity without compromising security or requiring significant changes from users or developers.

“Because data space is not EVM-accessible, it can be broadcasted separately from a block and verified separately from a block. Eventually, it can be verified with a technology called data availability sampling, which allows each node to verify that the data was correctly published by only randomly checking a few small samples. Once this is implemented, the blob space could be greatly expanded; the eventual goal is 16 MB per slot (~1.33 MB per second),” Buterin wrote.

The roadmap outlined by Buterin includes several critical areas for development. These include increasing blob capacity and enhancing L2 protocols to maximize data usage efficiency. The introduction of PeerDAS, a simplified version of data availability sampling, and EIP-7623 aims to further streamline Ethereum’s capacity for handling transactions and data, marking an ongoing commitment to scalability and efficiency.
Buterin also addresses the need for improvements within the L2 protocols themselves, from optimizing data compression to enhancing security measures. These improvements are crucial for supporting Ethereum’s growth and maintaining its position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications.

“We no longer have any excuse. Up until a couple of years ago, we were setting ourselves a low standard, building applications that were clearly not usable at scale, as long as they worked as prototypes and were reasonably decentralized. Today, we have all the tools we’ll need, and indeed most of the tools we’ll ever have, to build applications that are simultaneously cypherpunk and user-friendly,” Buterin emphasized.

The vision is for Ethereum to become a blockchain ecosystem that is capable of supporting a wide array of applications at scale and one that prioritizes user experience, security, and decentralization.

“BOME Will Be the Next SHIB” - Smart Money Investor


							

Smart Money whale predicts BOME will be the next SHIB.



The whale accurately predicted BOME’s rise, buying the memecoin before Binance’s listing.



BOME rallied over 300% within hours, making the whale one of the top gainers.




According to Lookonchain, the smart money on-chain platform, the whale who withdrew $2.3 million from Binance to buy 314 million BOME predicts the novel memecoin will be the next SHIB. The whale accurately predicted BOME’s recent rise and bought the memecoin before Binance listed it on its platform.







In a recent post on X, the identified whale noted it was not all bloom for him as an investor in crypto assets. According to him, a market downturn on March 15 caused him to panic over his capital in Binance Futures, where he risked liquidation. However, he quickly redirected his investment and bought BOME, the Solana-based memecoin.



Although the whale intended to preserve his capital, he claimed to have changed his mind after observing a growth in BOME’s popularity. According to the BOME investor, the newly launched memecoin became as famous as SHIB across the cryptocurrency network, turning the intended capital preservation into a viable investment.



Following SHIB’s growth pattern and the similarity he observed between the Shiba Inu memecoin and BOME, the whale claimed to have envisaged a similar scenario. However, he noted that BOME’s situation was more intense, leading to his decision to invest in the Solana-based memecoin.BOME started trading on November 16, 2024, for $0.00751, rallying over 300% within the first few hours, according to data from TradingView. The whale’s account indicates he invested in the memecoin before the rally began, making him one of the highest gainers from the rally. BOME traded for $0.0133 at the time of writing after pulling back from the initial rally and staging a recovery to the upside.

Vitalik Urges Ethereum Developers To Target ‘Millions’ Of Users Post-Dencun - The Defiant

Ethereum’s chief scientist said Ethereum is ready to support applications servicing millions of users following Dencun's massive L2 fee reductions.Vitalik Buterin, the chief scientist and co-founder of Ethereum, penned a blog post calling on developers to pivot their focus towards building new applications that could serve millions of users following the activation of its Dencun upgrade earlier this month.Ethereum’s highly-anticipated Dencun fork went live on March 13, ushering fee reductions of up to 95% on Layer 2 networks supporting EIP-4844 — the main upgrade included in Dencun. The fee reduction also precipitated triple-digit increases in transaction volume on leading L2s.Buterin described Dencun as the most significant Ethereum upgrade since The Merge, which transitioned the network to Proof of Stake consensus in September 2022.“As of two weeks ago, the two largest changes to the Ethereum blockchain — the switch to Proof of Stake, and the re-architecting to blobs — are behind us,” Buterin said.With fees on many Layer 2s now sitting below six cents, Buterin issued a challenge to developers to begin building applications addressing non-financial use cases that could serve “millions” of users.“Pretty much every crypto application that is not financial speculation depends on low fees — and so while we have high fees, we should not be surprised that we mainly see financial speculation,” Buterin said. “Now that we have blobs, this key constraint that has been holding us back all this time is starting to melt away… What this means to developers is simple: we no longer have any excuse.”Vitalik described the first nine years since Ethereum’s mainnet launch as a “training stage,” with low fees setting the stage for large-scale applications to take flight on the network. He said the tools are now available to build protocols that are both “cypherpunk and user-friendly,” urging developers to work on new applications targeting mainstream use cases including identity, reputation, and governance.“Ethereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem,” Buterin continued. “It's a full-stack replacement for large parts of ‘centralized tech’, and even provides some things that centralized tech does not... We are building tools for millions of people to use. Across the ecosystem, we need to fully readjust mindsets accordingly.”L2s need further developmentVitalik noted that more progress must be made on L2, including further mechanisms improving scalability, the efficiency of blobs, data compression, and security.Buterin said that just five of the 47 Layer 2 networks tracked by L2beat have reached “stage 1” decentralization, meaning they have only “limited training wheels” in place. In a previous post, Vitalik said stage 1 decentralization means that a network boasts a fraud or validity proof scheme, at least a seven-day delay on upgrades, and a multisig account with at least six of eight signers if a security council can override transactions.DeFi AlphaPremium ContentLooking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community.DeFi Daily | WeekdaysDeFi Alpha Letter | WeeklyDefiant Podcast Transcript | WeeklyInbox Dump | SaturdayWeekly Recap | SundayStart for free“The ecosystem's standards need to become stricter,” Buterin said. “So far, we have been lenient and accepted any project as long as it claims to be ‘on a path to decentralization’. By the end of the year, I think our standards should increase and we should only treat a project as a rollup if it has actually reached at least stage 1.”Buterin added that Ethereum’s core developers will continue to work on Layer 1 scaling in the background, describing the introduction of Verkle Trees with Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra fork as the last remaining “truly significant” upgrade still to come to Ethereum’s base layer.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Open Interest Hits Highest Level in 3 Years, Here’s Why



Bitcoin Cash remains a long distance from its all-time high of $4,355 which it attained back in December 2017.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently seeing a surge in open interest, and the reasons may not be far-fetched. On Thursday, open interest in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts soared to levels not seen since May 2021, reaching an impressive $708.75 million all-time high in the process.
The surge signals an 18.26% rise within 24 hours, and a 165% bump over the last seven days, per Coinglass data. Similarly, BCH price has picked up pace, surging 6.05% in the past 24 hours to stand at $578 as of press time.




Why Bitcoin Cash Is Seeing Record-Breaking Open Interest
The second-ever Bitcoin Cash halving is only a few days away. According to projections, the event, which will cut block rewards in half, is scheduled to take place on April 4. However, traders and investors appear to have already entered a race to secure good positions in anticipation of potential price movements.
A positive takeaway is that the surge in open interest indicates Bitcoin Cash is now more appealing than ever. This is because halving usually brings scarcity – a general recipe for increased value. So, traders might be bracing up for the potential price appreciation that will likely come with the upcoming event.
Miner activity is another factor that could be driving the surge. With the halving expected to bring block rewards from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH, miners too would be doubling down on their efforts.
A popular X user identified as DavidShares has corroborated this line of thought in a recent post. The user reported that the Bitcoin Cash hash rate has doubled in the past week.
Still Struggling with Acceptance
Despite its self-acclaimed technical superiority, BCH is still struggling to warm its way to the hearts of crypto lovers. Its market capitalization is significantly lower than that of Bitcoin (BTC), and it often faces skepticism due to its name and what appears to be a controversial history. To date, many view it as a “Bitcoin wannabe”, while others see it as an unserious experiment and not a real competitor to BTC.
For a better perspective, Bitcoin approaches its fourth halving on April 21 amid record highs. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash remains a long distance from its all-time high of $4,355 which it attained back in December 2017.
Be that as it may, Bitcoin Cash’s open interest surge is a positive that shows a budding interest in the cryptocurrency. Whether BCH would be able to maintain the momentum, however, remains to be seen. One thing is clear though, the countdown to the halving has injected fresh energy into the BCH market.

Search Engine Giant Google Announced It Will Allow Wallet Address Searches For These Altcoin Networks! - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a significant development for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, Google has expanded its search capabilities to include wallet address searches for various blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Fantom, Arbitrum, and others.
Google Introduces Wallet Address Searches for Bitcoin, Fantom, Arbitrum and More
This development allows users to conveniently check their wallet balances on different blockchain networks directly from the search engine.



Supported blockchain networks for wallet address lookups now include Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom.

Users can enter a wallet address into Google's search bar to get information about the remaining token balance in the wallet for each respective network.
Additionally, search results also show when the balance was last updated, providing users with real-time information on their cryptocurrency holdings.





Google clarified that the balances shown in search results represent only the native token for each network, and the last updated timestamp reflects the balance as of the last external transaction. It is important to note that updates to wallet balances are not instantaneous.
This latest feature builds on Google's recent efforts to support Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains in search results.



ENS provides readable domain names for Ethereum wallet addresses, allowing users to easily identify wallet owners. For example, vitalik.eth, the domain name of Ethereum producer Vitalik Buterin, can be searched on Google to view relevant wallet balance information.
Google's expansion of wallet address searches for various blockchain networks follows its initial support for Ethereum wallet balance searches that began in May of the previous year.





At the time, Google allowed users to search for specific public addresses and view wallet balances directly within the search results.

R. Kiyosaki reveals why ‘Boomer retirements’ are going broke


Not long after his warning that the upcoming stock market crash would particularly victimize his generation, a popular investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ explained why the Boomer generation retirements were going broke.
As it happens, Robert Kiyosaki pointed out that “another giant bank in China went bust” and that the same was happening in the United States “as commercial real estate, specifically office buildings go bust,” according to the X post he published on March 29.

Baby Boomers bust
Furthermore, he pointed out that the Baby Boomer generation was especially at risk due to their retirement plans containing “fake assets” through real estate investment trusts (REITs) “a.k.a. Mutual Fund ETFs for real estate,” and that “Boomer retirements are going broke as paper assets crash.”


To avert the damage caused by the imminent crash, Robert Kiyosaki has advised his followers to “get out of fake assets, including fiat, dollars and buy real gold, silver, and real Bitcoins, (…) regardless of your age,” adding that:

“I do not trust anything that can be printed. Go real… Get real.”

Robert Kiyosaki’s preparation plan
As a reminder, the famous entrepreneur with a massive following on social media earlier explained that his generation was about to suffer greatly in the upcoming “biggest stock market crash in history,” which was still coming amid the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, excessively printing paper money.
It is also important to note that Robert Kiyosaki has long argued that the best way to protect oneself from the fallout of this massive crash was to focus on investing in commodities and resources as the superior investment in 2024, including precious metals like gold and silver, Wagyu cattle, and maiden cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC).
That said, Bloomberg’s senior expert Mike McGlone has recently warned that commodities might be in trouble, preparing for a possible 30% crash under the influence of underperforming stocks and dipping government bond yield in China, the world’s top commodity consumer, as Finbold reported on March 28.

Under-the-Radar Memecoin That’s Exploded Over 5,800% in a Month on the Cusp of an ‘Epic Sprint’, Says Trader - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez is expressing bullish sentiment on an altcoin built on the Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution Base.
Martinez tells his 55,200 followers on the social media platform X that the memecoin Brett (BRETT) could appreciate by around 57% from the current level.










The analyst, however, warns that a correction of around 25% from the current level could occur first.
“The memecoin craze might seem to be cooling off, but I believe it’s just warming up. BRETT on Base is one of those that is gearing up for an epic sprint!
Before soaring, BRETT might dip to the $0.038 support, setting the stage for a bullish breakout to $0.080!”
Based on the analyst’s chart, it appears that the memecoin is forming an ascending triangle pattern in the one-hour time frame. An ascending triangle pattern is considered bullish once the price breaks out of the upper resistance level.

BRETT is trading at $0.0509 at time of writing, up by around 5,865% from the February 29 low of $0.000847.
Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the flagship crypto asset could go up by around 9% from the current level if a key support and psychological level holds.
“Bitcoin appears to be breaking out of a bull flag on the 4-hour chart! If BTC holds above $70,000, we could see a surge of nearly 10% to a new all-time high of $77,000!”

Bitcoin is trading at $70,612 at time of writing.

                        HSBC’s recent launch of retail gold tokens underscores the growing adoption of financial asset tokenization, a practice that’s transitioning from early adoption to mainstream use.However, challenges remain in ensuring standardization and broader integration.Asset tokenization leverages blockchain technology to represent ownership of real-world assets (real estate, art, shares, etc.) as tradable digital tokens. These tokens function as digital ownership certificates, enabling fractional ownership. As a result, it broadens the investor base and increases trading activity, thereby enhancing liquidity in these markets.A critical limitation of many current tokenization platforms is their narrow scope, according to Ralf Kubli, board member for the Casper Association. He explained that tokenization platforms prioritize the digitization of the underlying asset itself, neglecting to represent the associated liabilities and cash flows. Consequently, an asset-backed token is created and linked to a blockchain, with a separate PDF document containing the terms and conditions.Overcoming Tokenization’s Transparency Gap with Smart Financial Contracts
However, the dependence on manual cash flow calculations negates the very efficiency and automation that tokenization promises. This lack of transparency and verifiability surrounding cash flows presents a substantial risk, echoing a critical vulnerability exposed during the 2008 financial crisis.“The current projects do not define the cash flows of the underlying financial instrument in a machine-readable and machine-executable term sheet,” Hubli told Cryptonews on Thursday.“Failing to do so means we still have the same risks that have already plagued the financial industry for years. Especially the brute force efforts required around reconciliation.”The Role of Smart Contracts in Tokenization
Kubli proposes a clear solution: ensure all cash flows are algorithmically and deterministically defined within these assets.This necessitates the development of “smart financial contracts.” These contracts wouldn’t just encode information about the tokenized asset, but would also explicitly define all payment obligations of the parties involved. By doing so, they would comprehensively define both the asset and liability aspects of the financial instrument.“Fortunately, we do have such a standard available. Established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards (ACTUS) Research Foundation was formed to help clarify the cash-flow patterns of financial instruments based on collateralization,” he said.“Now, they have created and deployed an open-source standard that any business could use.”The adoption of standardized cash flow definitions within tokenized assets, as advocated by Kubli, would offer financial institutions real-time insight into their resources and obligations. This enhanced transparency could significantly mitigate the risk of a future crisis mirroring the events of 2008.

In a recent analysis conducted by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, it has been revealed that Dogecoin whales have engaged in significant accumulation, acquiring approximately 1.4 billion DOGE tokens valued at around $280 million over the course of the last two weeks.This accumulation phase began following a notable decline in DOGE's price, which dropped by 40% in the initial two weeks of March, hitting a low point after reaching a local high of $0.2 per DOGE.Illustrated in the accompanying chart is the discernible uptick in accumulation coinciding with the recent rally, during which the DOGE price surged by 78% within a nine-day time frame. At its current valuation of approximately $0.22 per token, Dogecoin reached a recent peak of $0.2288 per token, marking its highest point since November 2021. This surge in price can be attributed to various factors, including the underperformance to other meme coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), which experienced a notable 140% increase in value against Dogecoin over a two-week period.4/20 and "Dogecoin Father"Additionally, anticipation surrounding the month of April has contributed to DOGE's upward momentum, as historical trends indicate a tendency for significant price increases during this time, often linked to cultural events like the April 20 commemoration. Speculation regarding potential catalysts, including the impact of Elon Musk's tweets, further adds to market sentiment.Here's what happened previous April, for example. Despite uncertainties regarding future market movements, one undeniable observation is the strategic accumulation efforts by Dogecoin whales, reflecting their confidence in the cryptocurrency's potential. As enthusiasts and investors monitor these developments, Dogecoin remains the hottest topic in the space of digital assets right now.

Bitcoin's Market Dominance Poised for Growth, Predict Crypto Traders Amidst Ascending Triangle Pattern



                    
Several crypto traders have observed a promising pattern on the Bitcoin dominance chart, hinting at a possible increase in Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market. 



This pattern, known as an ascending triangle, suggests that Bitcoin’s market dominance might be on the rise. 




This technical analysis tool is identified by a chart pattern where the price moves within a confined area, marked by a rising trendline support and a flat resistance line, indicating potential upward momentum in Bitcoin’s market share.



Benjamin Cowen, a notable figure in the crypto community and the founder of Into The Cryptoverse, expressed his optimism regarding Bitcoin’s dominance, telling his substantial audience of over 810,000 on X on March 27, “The BTC dominance train is about to leave the station.” 



This sentiment is echoed by other traders who see the pattern as a bullish sign for Bitcoin.




Another prominent voice in the crypto space, a trader known as Beanie, shared with his nearly 195,000 followers on X that Bitcoin’s dominance is “coming back in a big way.”

Beanie pointed out that in bear markets, Bitcoin often becomes a refuge for investors, attributing to its perceived stability compared to other, more speculative assets. 



This shift towards Bitcoin in uncertain times is not unprecedented, as Beanie compared the current market conditions to the bear market of 2018, contrasting it with the bull market of 2021 where Bitcoin’s dominance saw a significant decline from 70% to 40%.



The landscape of Bitcoin’s market dominance has seen dramatic shifts over the years, from a commanding 85% in March 2017 to a record low of 32.45% by January 2018. As of the latest data from CoinStats, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 50.1%.



However, not all traders are convinced of this bullish outlook. 



Some, like Zero Ika, who has a following of 43,500 on X, argue that Bitcoin’s dominance is on a “long-term downtrend” from a macro perspective, suggesting a more cautious view of Bitcoin’s market share moving forward. 



This divergence of opinions highlights the speculative nature of the crypto market and the varying interpretations of market data among investors.

While Bitcoin Prepares for Halving, Another Record Prediction Came for BTC! - Bitcoin Sistemi


As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin prepares for the halving event, which is expected to take place in April, bullish expectations for BTC are increasing.
At this point, while the giant bank Standard Chartered increased its 2024 year-end BTC target to $ 150,000, Acheron Trading CEO Laurent Benayoun predicted that the Bitcoin price could increase by another 150% during the current bull market cycle.



Stating that at this point, the BTC price could rise up to $180,000 in the bull cycle, the famous CEO said that ETFs and the decrease in supply after the Bitcoin halving will be effective in this rise.
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Laurent Benayoun stated that the current bull cycle peak will be $180,000 and said:






“If we look at Bitcoin's past performances, the supply decreases in each cycle. Since the supply will be halved in this cycle, the BTC price may reach 2 to 3 times what we saw in previous cycles.
“I predict Bitcoin will reach $120,000 to $180,000 per unit.”

The famous CEO stated that the loosening of financial policy in the USA will contribute to the appreciation of the Bitcoin price and said, “The market is pricing in a decrease in interest rates because interest rates are horizontal, so it is logical to expect interest rates to decrease in the near future. A possible reduction in interest rates will have a positive impact on the BTC price.” .” said.

                    Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Fountain, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Pandora, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), FTX’s co-founder, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and $11 billion in forfeiture for massive fraud, marking a historic moment in the crypto industry. Judge Lewis Kaplan emphasized the sentence’s necessity due to Bankman-Fried’s risk-oriented decision-making philosophy known as “expected value” and lack of remorse.
Sam Enzer joined Unchained to unpack the sentencing, discussing the fairness of the length, explaining how the $11 billion forfeiture would work and how it’s different from the bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, Enzer provided insights into the kind of prison SBF would end up in and into the three-year supervised release SBF will face after his prison term. The conversation further delved into the broader impact of the sentencing on the crypto industry, suggesting it could signify the end of a dark chapter.
Show highlights:

Whether the 25-year sentence is fair, according to Sam
What the $11 billion in forfeiture means for SBF
Whether the assets of SBF actually belong to the FTX estate
Where SBF will likely go to prison and why Sam believes that SBF will not go to a maximum security prison
When the clock starts ticking for the 25-year sentence
Why SBF will not be eligible for parole and whether he could get “good time credit”
What the defense will attempt in appealing the conviction
What types of behavior could get SBF enough credit to appeal for a reduced sentence
Why SBF will have to be supervised for three years after his release
How SBF’s philosophy about “expected value,” was the theme of the crime, according to Judge Kaplan
Whether the co-conspirators, such as Caroline Ellison, will be sentenced and serve in prison
Why Sam says that the sentencing represented “the closing of a dark chapter” in crypto

Bitwise exec predicts $1T institutional shift to Bitcoin

Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, forecasted a huge surge of institutional investments into Bitcoin. He argued that ETFs could inject as much as $1 trillion into the digital asset. Hougan published these comments in a memo to investment professionals, which was a signal of a clear move toward crypto investments.Interest in Bitcoin ETFs is growing among institutional investorsHougan also discussed the volatility issues of Bitcoin in his memo. He accepted that the asset fluctuated in price between $60,000 and $70,000. Nevertheless, he recommended that investors take a long view. Hougan emphasized patience and listed future developments that can strengthen Bitcoin.Foremost among these occurrences is the expected endorsement of spot Bitcoin ETFs on the likes of Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. These developments, Hougan says, would give a good framework for institutional investments in Bitcoin. He pointed out due diligence processes taking place as critical steps before these institutions invest in the asset.The way to trillion-dollar inflowHougan positively commented on the future of Bitcoin, calling it a “rage bull market” and mentioning an almost 300% increase in the value of Bitcoin over the previous fifteen months. He credited this growth to Bitcoin spot ETF approval in January, which allowed investment professionals to participate.The Bitwise executive specified the slow but considerable move of investment professionals into the crypto world. He foresaw that this process would take years rather than months. Hougan also rejoiced in the $12 billion that came into ETFs since their introduction, making it the most successfully launched ETF ever.Prospects for investments and long-term visionAs for the future, Hougan pointed out the possibility of bigger investment inflows into Bitcoin. He claimed that if global drivers of wealth dedicated only 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it could mean $1 trillion of new investments. This amount is quite huge in comparison to the 12 billion dollars that have already been invested in ETFs, which reflects an untapped potential for the cryptocurrency market.Confidence was Hougan’s characteristic when the price of Bitcoin fluctuated. He proposed that oscillations are a fact of life in the short term, but the long-term future for Bitcoin is bright. He emphasized the strategic significance of professional investors to gradually join the crypto market, a development that he sees as sustaining the growth of Bitcoin through the years.Matthew Hougan’s insights shed light on the burgeoning relationship between institutional investors and the cryptocurrency market. With ETFs as a conduit, Bitcoin stands on the brink of a significant transformation. Hougan’s memo not only reassures existing investors but also signals a watershed moment for potential institutional entrants into the crypto space.

Crypto traders bet $2.4M on spot Ether ETF approval results

Crypto gamblers are placing bets on whether a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before May 31.Polygon-based crypto gambling site Polymarket shows that traders have placed “Yes” or “No” bets on whether a spot Ether ETF application will be approved before May ends. Over $2.4 million worth of bets have been placed, with about 81% pessimistic about the chances of a spot Ether ETF approval before the end of May. Spot Ether ETF approval’s betting market. Source: PolymarketCrypto traders buy yes or no shares, depending on their predictions of how they expect things to go. The share’s value represents the odds of the bet and changes similarly to how the crypto market goes. At the moment, the cost of a Yes share is $0.19, while No is worth $0.81. This means fewer gamblers believe in the chances of spot ETH ETF approvals before the end of May. The top trader for Yes holds about $84,000 worth of shares, while the top holder for No has around $127,000 in No shares.If the SEC approves a spot Ether ETF before the betting market’s deadline of May 31, 2024, at 11:59 ET, the market will resolve, meaning that holders of Yes shares will be able to cash out their earnings. However, the opposite also applies if there are no approvals before the date. Related: Bitwise files with SEC for spot Ether ETF listingThis is not the first time that crypto traders gambled on ETF approval results. On Jan. 5, Reddit users criticized Polymarket gamblers for betting on whether spot Bitcoin ETFs would be approved by the SEC before Jan. 15. A Reddit user described the betting as stupid and said it was like putting up dollars to win dimes. Meanwhile, another joked that they were about to lose their kid’s college fund to place a bet. The overall bets on the ETF outcomes have reached at least $12 million on the predictions market. The SEC eventually approved the trading and listing of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10.Investment management company Grayscale has expressed confidence in the approvals of spot Ether ETFs in May. On March 25, Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said that the SEC’s perceived “lack of engagement” with applicants does not indicate whether an ETF will be approved or not.

                        Brandon Mintz, CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator Bitcoin Depot, predicts a global surge in Bitcoin ATM installations following the Bitcoin halving. Mintz anticipates that the period after the halving, when crypto FOMO (fear of missing out) typically intensifies, will drive increased demand for Bitcoin ATMs. In 2023, crypto ATM installations experienced their first-ever yearly decline in a decade, likely due to the bear market exacerbated by the collapse of several crypto firms.However, the start of 2024 has already shown promising signs, with 1,469 crypto ATMs installed in the first three months alone, compared to the over 3,000 removed during the same period in 2023, according to data from CoinATMRadar. FOMO to Drive Users to Bitcoin ATMs
Mintz expects the FOMO phase and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies to drive more customers to Bitcoin teller machines. “It’s looking really positive that the industry continues to see a lot of growth in kiosk count.”However, he believes it is still early in the cycle, as the halving event, scheduled for late April, approaches. Historically, the uptick in Bitcoin adoption and ATM usage tends to occur after the halving, when the price of Bitcoin experiences significant growth.While the number of teller machines has increased recently, Mintz notes that over the past 18 months, the number of ATM operators has actually decreased.The bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a major operator with 5,000 ATMs, was one of the notable casualties. Mintz attributes the decline to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, which had a significant impact on the crypto market.Bitcoin Depot, in its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results, reported a 7% increase in revenues compared to the previous year. The company has plans to install 900 teller machines in the first quarter of 2024 and an additional 940 ATMs in convenience stores across 24 states in the United States.Mintz believes that the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States will not negatively impact Bitcoin ATMs. He views the ETF customer base as different from that of Bitcoin ATMs, with ATM users primarily transacting in cash. Mintz suggests that the increased adoption and price growth driven by ETFs could actually lead to more ATM usage as Bitcoin adoption continues to rise.Bitcoin ATM Hacks Become Prevalent
Bitcoin ATM scams are becoming increasingly prevalent, resulting in unsuspecting users losing substantial sums of money. Last year, major Bitcoin teller machine manufacturer General Bytes experienced a security breach that led to $1.5 million worth of BTC stolen from a number of its crypto teller machine operators. At the time, General Byes founder Karel Kyovsky said that a hacker was able to upload their own Java application onto the company’s Bitcoin ATMs, which allowed them to read and decrypt API keys to access funds on exchanges and hot wallets.In August 2022, General Bytes also reported a hack that led to the theft of deposited Bitcoins at ATMs, which led to around $16,000 stolen.

Bitcoin wallets drained as infostealer malware targets Call of Duty players - Crypto Briefing




A group of unidentified cybercriminals has released an information stealer malware targeting gamers who cheat in Call of Duty, resulting in the theft of bitcoin (BTC) holdings from affected players.The malware has already compromised hundreds of thousands of accounts, with the numbers continuing to grow.According to vx-underground, an information security and malware market resource, the malware has impacted at least 561,000 Activision accounts, over 3.6 million Battlenet accounts, as well as over 117,000 accounts from Elite PVPers.
“Impacted users have begun reporting being victims of crypto-draining — their Electrum BTC wallets have been drained. We do not have any information on the amount of money stolen,” vx-underground said in a disclosure published on X.
Activision Blizzard, the American video game holding company behind the Call of Duty series, has confirmed the existence of the malware and said that they are working with PhantomOverlay, one of the providers of cheat engines and codes for the video game series. Activision Blizzard became a subsidiary of Microsoft after a $68.7 billion acquisition in 2022. This is not the first time that game cheaters have been targeted by exploiters. In 2018, a supposed cheat for the popular video game Fortnite turned out to be malware designed to steal Bitcoin wallet login details. Fortnite players were again targeted in 2019, with hackers blocking access to users’ entire device data.
“There is not enough data yet on how [the malware] is spreading, [it] could be only affecting folks who have third-party tools installed,” a source familiar with the matter said.
PhantomOverlay first noticed the suspicious activity when users reported unauthorized purchases. Other cheat providers, such as Elite PVPers, have also confirmed similar attacks on vx-underground in the past week.However, while the current estimated number of compromised accounts is substantial, PhantomOverlay claimed in a Telegram broadcast message on Wednesday that the figures “are inflated” dismissing database logins as “invalid garbage.”In a separate statement, PhantomOverlay also claimed that they had some idea who the threat actors behind the malware distribution scheme are.
“[…] the malware gang is aware of suspicions on them [and have] made it increasingly hard to prove anything,” PhantomOverlay said.
To date, the total amount of crypto stolen remains unknown.

Top 5 Rising Stars: Exploring the Leading Projects on TON Blockchain



                    
The TON (The Open Network) ecosystem is rapidly becoming a pivotal force in the cryptocurrency domain, attracting a wide range of developers and investors due to its burgeoning growth and innovative capabilities. Originally envisioned by Pavel Durov for use with Telegram, TON has since morphed into a powerful, scalable network known for its swift transactions and intuitive applications. This piece highlights five cryptocurrencies within the TON ecosystem poised for noteworthy expansion.



1. Gramcoin (GRAM): The Premier Choice



Potential for growth: Significant




Within the Telegram community, Gramcoin, or GRAM, has carved out a niche for itself, thanks to its innovative approach to mining. Unlike traditional methods, GRAM allows for mining via video cards using Givers — specialized smart contracts that assign computational tasks. This process rewards miners in a manner akin to the Bitcoin protocol but without necessitating the use of costly ASIC hardware. This decentralized mining strategy ensures inclusivity, allowing individuals with video cards to participate, ultimately leading to a more equitable distribution of tokens.



The GRAM community has swelled to include tens of thousands of enthusiasts, drawn by its open and decentralized model. Within this community, many see GRAM as the potential successor to Bitcoin, capable of following in Bitcoin’s pioneering footsteps within the world of digital currencies. While both cryptocurrencies offer fast and cost-effective money transfers, GRAM, operating on the high-performance TON blockchain, sets itself apart with its instant transactions, accessibility to mining, and inclusive nature. GRAM mining only requires a video card and a simple software setup, making it accessible to any user. In contrast, Bitcoin mining now requires substantial initial capital, limiting participation to investors with significant resources.



Within the TON ecosystem, GRAM trades actively on a number of decentralized platforms, including STON.fi, Ton Diamonds, DeDust, and the Cryptorg bot on Telegram. Since its launch in January, GRAM’s valuation has soared by 28,000 times, with its user base expanding to over 30,000 in just a couple of months. With rumors of potential listings on major exchanges swirling within the project’s Telegram group, the GRAM community is abuzz with anticipation for what the future holds. Keen observers have noted significant GRAM token transfers, including transactions of over a million units to wallets linked with MEXC and OKX exchanges.




2. Notcoin (NOT): The Viral Sensation of the TON Ecosystem



Potential for growth: Moderate



NOT, a meme coin originating from the Notcoin clicker game within the TON ecosystem, has experienced a remarkable surge in popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts during the winter season. This surge can be attributed to the widespread distribution of free giveaways. As of mid-March 2024, the Notcoin community boasts an impressive user base of over 30 million people on Telegram, with 5 million users actively engaging with the platform on a daily basis.



The game itself is straightforward and integrated directly into Telegram chats, requiring players to simply tap on the Notcoin symbol to earn coins with each press. However, the game introduces a strategic element by limiting the energy available for clicking; it depletes with each tap but gradually regenerates over time, preventing endless clicking. Players can also acquire NOTs through various activities such as participating in specific Telegram groups or channels, using referral links to invite friends, and advancing these friends to higher tiers within the game. An exclusive offer of 50,000 Notcoins was available to Telegram Premium subscribers, but as of April 1, 2024, the Notcoin team announced they would cease the “mining” process of the coin, a decision shared by the Web3 gaming project.



In an interesting twist, NOT has established a friendly relationship with the GRAM project. The creator of NOT holds GRAM tokens and has organized competitions rewarding winners with GRAM tokens. This collaboration highlights the strong sense of community and shared objectives among supporters of these projects.



3.  STON.fi (STON): The Premier DEX within TON



Potential for growth: Above Average



STON.fi stands as a pivotal decentralized exchange (DEX) within the TON ecosystem, operating on an innovative automated market maker (AMM) model. Established in 2022, it utilizes request-for-quote (RFQ) mechanisms and hashed time-locked contracts (HTLC) for seamless cross-chain swaps, positioning itself as a technological frontrunner in facilitating secure and efficient trading.



With a daily trading volume reaching $7 million, STON.fi not only showcases the vibrant activity within the TON ecosystem but also signifies the trust and reliance traders place in its infrastructure. This figure, one of the highest among emerging TON-based platforms, indicates a robust and growing interest in TON’s offerings.



STON.fi’s growth potential is rated above average, buoyed by the TON ecosystem’s expanding user base and the intrinsic value of its technological foundation. The STON token, integral to protocol governance and voting through long-term bets, has seen a remarkable six-fold increase in value from February to March 2024, peaking at $18. This growth trajectory underscores STON.fi’s solid market position and its pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) within the TON ecosystem.



4. DeFinder Innovations (DFI): Pioneering the TON Ecosystem Landscape



Potential for growth: Moderate



DeFinder Innovations (DFI) stands as a comprehensive initiative within the TON ecosystem, showcasing a diverse array of products including the ARBUZ gaming experience with ongoing coin rewards, the DeWallet virtual wallet, the DeFinder Innovations Fund, ArrakenPlanet agricultural simulation game, and a groundbreaking TON-based betting platform. These varied offerings aim to meet a wide range of user preferences, spanning entertainment, financial management, and investment avenues.



DFI is on a mission to emerge as the leading community within the TON ecosystem by addressing gaps in services and product offerings and enhancing TON’s appeal through active user involvement. DeFinder Innovations seeks to unify different facets of the cryptocurrency community, fostering a cohesive environment. This goal is facilitated by the strategic use of the DFI token for ecosystem governance, employing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model to distribute tokens from a communal pool to engage and incentivize participation.



With its moderate growth potential, DFI’s innovative ecosystem and broad service portfolio set it up as a key contender in the TON arena. The initiative has attracted attention and support from the TON Foundation, highlighted by a significant $20,000 donation from the foundation’s leader to DeFinder’s wallet. Furthermore, DFI’s trading value has seen an extraordinary rise of 1440% since December 2023, illustrating a promising path towards realizing its lofty ambitions.



TonUp (TONUP): Catalyzing Project Launches



Potential for growth: Moderate



TonUp operates as an essential catalyst within The Open Network (TON), dedicated to promoting new project launches by providing necessary funding and liquidity. As a foundational element of TON’s project incubation framework, TonUp plays a crucial role in encouraging innovation and contributing to the ecosystem’s growth.



To safeguard and potentially enhance the value of its tokens, TonUp adopts a methodical approach involving regular token redemptions and destructions, effectively diminishing the total supply in circulation. This strategy aims to not only stabilize but also increment the value of TonUP tokens, instilling additional confidence among investors regarding the platform’s future prospects.



TonUP has showcased remarkable performance, with its token value experiencing a 180% increase within a month, peaking at $1.2 on March 25. This surge reflects strong investor trust and market demand for what TonUp has to offer. With its strategic approach to token management and its status as an incubator, TonUP exhibits moderate growth potential, marking it as an instrumental entity in attracting further innovation and investment to the TON ecosystem.



Synergizing Leading TON Initiatives



Examining these five cryptocurrencies unveils their critical contributions and potential within the TON ecosystem. Each project brings unique solutions and strategic visions to the table, enhancing TON’s vibrancy and innovation capacity. From GRAM’s commitment to decentralization to NOT’s captivating gameplay, DFI’s community-centric approach, STON.fi’s trailblazing DEX model, and TONUP’s facilitative role in project launches, these endeavors collectively highlight the expansive opportunities for growth and innovation in The Open Network. As they evolve and broaden their influence, their combined efforts are set to redefine the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

This Memecoin Edges Out PEPE for Third in Market Cap


The Solana meme coin season persists as dogwifhat (WIF) witnesses its market capitalization reach $4 billion on Friday.
WIF touched $4 on Friday morning, a new all-time high from Solana’s latest dog-themed memecoin. 
Dogwifhat Climbs to Third Spot in Memecoin Market Cap Rankings
During the recent price surge, WIF surpassed PEPE to claim third in the rankings. Solana’s inaugural dog-themed meme coin now finds itself behind WIF. Currently, BONK holds a market capitalization that is almost half the size of WIF.

Having launched in November 2023 at a measly price of $0.0000021, WIF has seen a meteoric rise within the crypto sector, climbing as high as 40 in the total market cap rankings.

Solana memecoins continue to see a rise in popularity. The increased interest in trading Solana-based tokens comes off the back of cheaper gas fees. Something Ethereum has yet to overcome. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently broke $4 billion and currently sits at $4.5 billion as interest continues to increase.

The recent listing by tier 1 exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin has only added credibility to the project, which describes itself on its website as “LITERALLY JUST A DOG WIF A HAT.”

While WIF remains the top memecoin on Solana, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain the top dogs, with market caps 3x and 5x that of WIF. Safe to say no one will be catching the top two anytime soon.

SOL Price Forecast: Consolidation Phase Prepping for a Bull Run?


Since peaking on March 17, Solana has maintained a unique user count consistently above 800,000, signaling a strong community engagement that reflects positively on the Solana (SOL) price. Daily DEX trades on the blockchain remain high, underscoring sustained active participation. 
While the outlook for Solana remains bullish, it’s anticipated that the current consolidation phase may persist a bit longer before the token experiences a significant uptick once again.
Solana Total Value Locked Remains Above $4 Billion
Recently, the Solana ecosystem has achieved a noteworthy achievement by surpassing the $4 billion mark in Total Value Locked (TVL) for the first time since April 2022. This mark was reached on March 15, and since March 22, Solana TLV has remained above $4 billion. 
This significant metric, which tallies the aggregate value of assets deposited across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms within Solana, serves as a critical indicator of the ecosystem’s overall health, the effectiveness of its DeFi applications, and the degree of user engagement. The recent uptick in TVL shows a revival of investor confidence and an escalating interest in the DeFi offerings available on Solana.

Historically, Solana’s TVL reached its peak in 2021, with figures soaring above $10 billion. This period of exponential growth was followed by a marked decrease, leading to a considerable contraction in TVL. The span from November 2022 to November 2023 saw the TVL fluctuating within the range of $250 million to $350 million, indicating a phase of stabilization and consolidation for the Solana ecosystem. 

This phase was crucial in laying the foundation for the subsequent revival, as it reflected a period of equilibrium that ultimately paved the way for the current surge in DeFi activity on Solana.

Solana Users and DEX Trades Remain Strong
A notable event was the unprecedented daily volume of Decentralized Exchange (DEX) transactions, reaching a record 7.86 million on March 14, setting a new high. From March 14 onwards, Solana’s DEX trading volume consistently exceeded 6 million transactions daily, a stark contrast to the period before December 2023 when daily transaction volumes peaked at 2.2 million on Solana DEXs.
Between March 19 and 24, unique daily DEX trades were always around the 6 million zone. Then, it started to grow again, reaching more than 7 million from March 25 to March 27.

Another metric drawing attention from Solana’s on-chain analytics is the Daily Unique Transaction Signers, which gauges the number of unique users transacting on the network each day.

Starting in January 2024, there’s been a consistent rise in this metric. It reached 823,000 users by March 14 and soared above 2,000,000 by March 17. That represents an increase of 143% in just three days. Yet, after surpassing 2,000,000 daily unique users, the count of daily signers began to diminish, dropping to 936,000 by March 21. After some consolidation, that number started to rise again. 
Solana registered 873,000 unique users on March 23, and that number grew to 1.1 million on March 27.
SOL Price Prediction: EMA Lines Are Drawing a Consolidation
The SOL 4-hour price chart clearly indicates the 20 EMA line nearing a dip below the 50 EMA line. EMAs, more responsive than SMAs, adeptly reflect market trends by weighting recent price movements, crucial for identifying trend directions and reversals.

When the shorter-term 20 EMA crosses under the longer-term 50 EMA, it typically signals a shift towards bearish momentum. This movement often ushers in a consolidation phase, where prices stabilize as the market reaches equilibrium between buyers and sellers.

Observing the SOL price chart, it’s evident that while short-term EMAs stand well above the longer-term ones, they are aligning with current price levels. That indicates that SOL is indeed undergoing a consolidation phase.

Should Solana undergo a correction, it may test the $167 support level. If SOL fails to hold, the next potential support is at $137. However, should the bullish momentum resume, this consolidation could serve as a springboard. This would potentially propel SOL back to its journey to a new all-time high. Its previous record is $259.97, reached in November 2021.

BTC and BCH Make Gains Days Before Halving Takes Place


							

BCH rebounded significantly, climbing above $500 a few days before its next halving event.



Data from Coinglass shows a significant increase in Open Interest in BCH-backed futures.



BTC has gained 7% this week with the return of the bulls after a two-week bearish period.




Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded significantly, climbing above $500 a few days before its next halving event. The Bitcoin fork bounced off a swing low of around $348 to surpass its highest price since December 2021, according to data from TradingView.



Data from Coinglass shows a significant increase in Open Interest (OI) in BCH-backed futures is partly responsible for the recent surge in the cryptocurrency’s price. At the time of writing, the OI in BCH-tracked futures had more than doubled to $500 million on Thursday from $213 million last week.



The surge in OI continued and recorded an additional 17.71% rally within 24 hours as of Friday morning. As of the time of writing, it has increased by an additional $202 million to $702 million. This surge shows increased leveraged bets on more expected price volatility a few days before the halving event. The crypto community expects BCH halving to happen on April 3, 2024, five days from filing this report.



Bitcoin surged alongside BCH following a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of $73,794, according to data from TradingView. The flagship crypto rebounded from a $64,537 recent low, climbing above $70,000. 



BTC has gained 7% this week with the return of the bulls after a two-week bearish period adjudged to be triggered by a profit-taking action after a significant bull run. With the recent rebound, many crypto community members believe Bitcoin is preparing for a new phase of volatility toward the upcoming halving event. Meanwhile, data from Deribit, a leading cryptocurrency options exchange, shows that it will settle $15.2 billion worth of quarterly contracts this Friday, with Bitcoin accounting for $9.5 billion of the volume. Users expect this development to catalyze the top crypto’s volatility ahead of the halving event, which will take place on April 20, 2024.

In a remarkable turn of events, over 264 million Dogecoin (DOGE) were transferred in significant transactions involving the trading platform Robinhood. These movements, documented by Whale Alert, a service dedicated to tracking large transactions, highlight the ongoing interest in Dogecoin, especially against the backdrop of its recent price surge.The first transaction recorded by Whale Alert involved an enormous transfer of 200 million DOGE, with a market value of approximately $43 million, from an unidentified wallet to Robinhood. Hours after this initial transfer, a second significant movement was detected. This involved 64,438,642 DOGE, valued at roughly $13.8 million, moving from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. These transfers out of Robinhood indicate a considerable accumulation of Dogecoin. They are characteristic of "whale" behavior in the market. Whales possess the market power to influence price movements and market dynamics significantly. Their actions, such as the massive accumulations and transfers of DOGE observed, can lead to rallies or trigger volatility in the market. Notably, the involvement of a mainstream trading platform like Robinhood in these transactions shows the accessibility and interest in Dogecoin among retail investors. Robinhood's platform facilitates easy entry for individuals looking to participate in cryptocurrency trading, thereby amplifying the impact of trading on market dynamics.Dogecoin price holds gainsThese transactions come at a time when Dogecoin has shown remarkable bullish behavior. The price of DOGE has surged to $0.2121, marking a 65.61% increase in the last 30 days. Such a price rally in Dogecoin often attracts interest from both individual and institutional investors, contributing to increased trading volumes and market activity.Several factors contribute to Dogecoin's popularity and price volatility, including social media influence, endorsements by public figures and its cult status within the cryptocurrency community. Moreover, the broader market trend toward meme coins and speculative assets has further fueled Dogecoin's rally.As Dogecoin continues to rally, the crypto community remains divided on its future prospects, with some viewing these developments as indicators of confidence and others as a reminder of the inherent volatility and speculative risk in the market. The actions of large investors and the role of platforms facilitating access to these markets will continue to be critical in shaping market trends.

Ethereum Founder Lays Out 'What Else Memecoins Could Be'


								In a blog post, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has laid out a vision for the future of memecoins that challenges the crypto community to rethink their potential beyond mere speculative assets. Titled “What Else Could Memecoins Be?”, published on March 29, 2024, Buterin’s comprehensive analysis not only critiques the current state of memecoins but also proposes innovative pathways for their evolution.
Ethereum Founder Is Disappointed With Memecoins
Reflecting on the genesis of his thinking around digital currencies, Buterin recounts, “Ten years ago, two weeks before the Ethereum project was publicly announced, I published this post […] arguing that issuing coins could be a new way to fund important public projects.” He envisioned digital currencies like AntiCancerCoin or ClimateCoin as mechanisms through which societal contributions could be directed towards significant causes, thereby leveraging blockchain technology for the public good.
The discourse around memecoins today, however, has deviated significantly from such ideals, Buterin notes. The resurgence of meme coins has been marked not by innovation but by controversy, including instances of overt racism within certain Solana meme coin projects.

This trend has stirred discontent within the crypto space, leading figures like Ethereum philosopher Polynya to express severe disillusionment. Buterin quotes Polynya’s reaction to underscore the depth of the community’s unease: “Even long-time Ethereum philosopher Polynya is very very unhappy.”
Seeking solutions to this quandary, Buterin introduces the concept of “charity coins” — cryptocurrencies where a substantial portion of the token supply is allocated to charitable endeavors. He reminisces about past initiatives like “GiveWell Inu,” which supported effective altruism through GiveWell, and “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” aimed at funding anti-aging research among other causes.
Despite mixed results and challenges, such as the dissolution of GiveWell Inu and community issues with “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” Buterin sees potential in the idea. He recalls the positive impact of donating half the supply of the Dogelon Mars token to the Methuselah Foundation, highlighting the benefits of aligning cryptocurrency projects with charitable causes.
Integration Into Blockchain Gaming
Expanding on this idea, Buterin advocates for the integration of gaming into the memecoin ecosystem through what he terms “Robin Hood games.” These games would not only offer entertainment but also provide a means of supporting public goods and enabling financial gains for participants, especially those from lower-income backgrounds.

He emphasizes the importance of creating genuinely engaging and enjoyable games, critiquing and praising the play-to-earn model exemplified by Axie Infinity for its mixed outcomes. Buterin is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for these games to democratize cryptocurrency participation, offering a unique blend of fun, financial opportunity, and societal contribution.
He states, “Don’t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don’t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain.”
In his concluding remarks, Buterin calls for a more nuanced approach to evaluating crypto projects, urging the community to recognize and support initiatives that align with their values, even if they stem from traditionally criticized sectors. He advocates for a crypto space that is not only more inclusive and entertaining but also one that actively contributes to the betterment of society.
I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1. […] At the least, more good memecoins than bad ones, ideally those that support public goods instead of just enriching insiders and creators.

So, why is Dogecoin going up? Notably, the latest gains are happening against the backdrop of the increased whale accumulation but also Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle (EV) behemoth Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), announcing the company’s plans to enable DOGE payments for its products.
Dogecoin price prediction 2024
So, how high will Dogecoin go? If whale activity is anything to go by (and it is), this asset is looking at a bright future this year, with some experts setting their DOGE price prediction as high as $1 by mid-April, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms eyeing $0.41-$0.51 area as their Dogecoin price prediction 2025.
In conclusion, although things are looking great for the top doge meme coin now, it is important to remember that making any definitive Dogecoin prediction is challenging, as the situation in the crypto industry can change, so doing one’s own research and monitoring any Dogecoin news is critical when investing.

Regulation crypto: the SEC can proceed against Coinbase

In a significant development in crypto regulation, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of New York has ruled that the case involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, must proceed, denying the motion to dismiss.
This decision represents a crucial moment in the ongoing legal examination of Coinbase’s operations in the cryptocurrency sphere.
SEC moves against Coinbase: the government regulatory authority’s attempt to regulate the crypto world
Judge Failla’s decision stems from the SEC’s allegations that Coinbase operated as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without proper registration, in addition to conducting an unregistered sale of securities through its staking program.
The judge has granted most of the SEC’s requests, but has rejected the claim that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker with its Wallet application.
Coinbase, which was sued by the SEC last year, vehemently contested these accusations, requesting the dismissal of the case and accusing the regulatory authority of using a “regulation through enforcement” strategy. 
However, with the court ruling in favor of the SEC, the case is now set to proceed to trial, which will likely begin in 2025.
The judge’s decision highlights the SEC’s ability to take legal action against cryptocurrency platforms operating outside regulatory frameworks.
Allowing the case to proceed, Judge Failla highlighted the importance of adhering to securities laws in the thriving cryptocurrency sector.
One of the crucial aspects of the ruling concerns the application of the Howey test, a legal standard established by a 1946 case of the United States Supreme Court. 
The test evaluates whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore as a security. Judge Failla has ruled that some cryptocurrency transactions on the Coinbase platform met the criteria outlined in the Howey test, reinforcing the SEC’s allegations of selling unregistered securities.
The irrelevant charges to the court’s judgment
However, not all of the SEC’s accusations carried weight in the court’s ruling. The claim that Coinbase’s Wallet application operated as an unregistered broker was rejected by Judge Failla. 
The judge ruled that the SEC did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim, highlighting a significant victory for Coinbase in the legal battle.
Furthermore, Coinbase had invoked the doctrine of big questions in its defense, arguing that the SEC’s actions lacked a clear authorization from Congress for matters of significant national importance. 
Despite Coinbase’s claims, Judge Failla was not convinced, emphasizing that the impact of the cryptocurrency industry is not significant enough to constitute a major part of the American economy.
Furthermore, Coinbase has argued that the SEC violated due process by initiating charges without proper notice.
However, Judge Failla rejected this claim, citing the SEC’s efforts to provide guidance and warnings to Coinbase regarding potential enforcement actions related to the sale of certain crypto-assets.
This legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC highlights broader issues regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. 
With the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency sector, regulatory clarity remains a pressing concern for market participants and authorities.
The outcome of this case could set important precedents for future regulatory actions and for the overall trajectory of the cryptocurrency market.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Judge Failla’s decision to allow the advancement of the SEC’s requests against Coinbase represents a significant development in the ongoing legal saga between the exchange and the regulatory authority. 
On one hand, the ruling presents challenges for Coinbase, especially regarding the alleged securities violations, on the other hand it highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. 
As the case moves towards trial, all eyes will be on the courtroom as it faces the intersection between law and innovation in the digital asset landscape.

Future of Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin's Vision Unveiled


							

Vitalik Buterin talked about the future of Ethereum post-Merge and Dencun upgrade.



ETH has entered a new phase where “blob fee markets” enter “price discovery mode.”



Buterin said that the debut of Blobscriptions brings a dynamic element to the fee structures




Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin offered insights into the future trajectory of the Ethereum network, shedding light on key developments and innovations while providing a roadmap for Ethereum’s scalability.



In a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Buterin acknowledged the existence of “blobs” while asking, “Where do we go from here?”



Buterin talked about the Dencun hard fork, stating that Ethereum entered a new phase where “blob fee markets” entered “price discovery mode,” marking a pivotal moment in the blockchain’s development. 



Additionally, the introduction of Blobscriptions brings a dynamic element to Ethereum’s fee structures, signaling a shift towards greater flexibility and efficiency in transaction processing.



Buterin also highlighted the importance of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which is paving the way for future scalability enhancements. Buterin said:




“I argue that now that the merge and EIP-4844 are done, we are decidedly on the right side of the S-curve. Further L1 changes will be quite meaningful and significant, but relatively milder.”




He also advocated for raising the standards of rollups, calling for a shift towards more advanced iterations that offer enhanced security and performance.



The Ethereum co-creator concluded that Ethereum is currently transitioning from a period of “very rapid L1 progress” to a phase where the L1 development will be significant but “more mellow and less disruptive to applications.” Buterin also said that Ethereum has upgraded from being “just” a financial ecosystem to being much more. 



As reported earlier, Buterin also emphasized the critical importance of ERC-4337 as account abstraction (AA) gains traction.

This is Why Another Nation Has Banned WorldCoin


Portugal has imposed a temporary halt on Sam Altman’s WorldCoin from collecting biometric data. 
The decision highlights escalating global concerns over privacy and data protection rights with technologies that harvest sensitive personal information.
Portugal Bans WorldCoin
WorldCoin, aimed at creating a unique digital ID and financial network through facial scans, has registered over 4.5 million individuals across 120 nations. Yet, the venture’s ambition hit a snag in Portugal, where the CNPD highlighted the acute risk to citizen data protection, citing the need for “urgent intervention.” 
The suspension, affecting a service that engaged over 300,000 Portuguese citizens, follows numerous complaints regarding unauthorized data collection. This is particularly regarding minors and issues around consent withdrawal and data deletion.
Still, Jannick Preiwisch, WorldCoin’s Data Protection Officer, emphasized the project’s adherence to legal standards, expressing surprise at the allegations. He assured efforts are underway to rectify any reported issues, especially concerning underage participation.

“The report from CNPD is the first time we are hearing from them regarding many of these matters, including reports of underage sign-ups in Portugal, for which we have zero tolerance for and are working to address in all instances, even if a matter of a few reports,” Preiwisch said.

How much will MARA stock be worth if Bitcoin hits $100,000?


Notable absentees of the ongoing crypto market rally have, for the most part, been major Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms. 
This, perhaps, isn’t surprising given that the companies not only suffered immense damage during the ‘crypto winter’ but their prospects for the Bitcoin halving might not be as stellar as might appear at first glance.
Indeed, as the mining rewards are set to become smaller, Bitcoin prices will have to increase significantly for the miners to remain profitable and the world’s premier cryptocurrency would have to rise above $120,000 for firms like Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) to maintain relative parity with the 2021 bull market.


Still, given the halving is likely to favor bigger firms, and that stocks like MARA have done all except match the crypto market rally, they may constitute value buying opportunities as of late March 2024. 
With these troubling yet promising circumstances in mind, Finbold decided to ask and try to answer, how high could the stock of Marathon Digital – the biggest Bitcoin miner by market cap – rise should BTC hit $100,000?
MARA stock price chart
So far, the stock of Marathon Digital has shown some correlation with Bitcoin’s movements, though nowhere near as much as companies such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). 
While Bitcoin’s 52-week surge of 147.67% was accompanied by MARA’s rise of 184.03%, the coin’s year-to-date (YTD) rally of 58.95% wasn’t shadowed by the miner which declined 1.53% in the same time frame.
BTC vs MARA YTD price charts. Source: Google
In fact, the correlation between the two appears to have weakened in recent weeks. 
While BTC reached a new all-time high in March. Marathon Digital shares erased most of their earlier 2024 gains.
The miner has, however, been catching up in the last 5 trading days and managed a 7.17% climb to $22.58.
Where will MARA stock stand if BTC hits $100,000?
The recently-observable correlation – or lack thereof – between MARA and Bitcoin makes predicting future movements for the stock difficult. Indeed, the 2024 figures hint that Marathon Digital shares might remain level, or drop toward $20 even should Bitcoin hit the long-awaited high.
Both the longer-term and the most recent performance, however, demonstrate that the miner could match and slightly exceed Bitcoin’s rise and that should the cryptocurrency land at $100,000, MARA could climb to a range between $35 and $40.
Finally, Bitcoin’s movements could have a disproportionate effect on the miner’s shares. There remains a strong possibility that should BTC rally in a fashion akin to its previous halvings – maybe reaching or exceeding Robert Kiyosaki’s 2024 $300,000 price target – MARA could repeat its 2020 and 2021 rally and surge toward $1,400.
While such a 6,000% rally might appear more appropriate for a penny stock Marathon Digital was at the time of Bitcoin’s last halving, it is worth remembering that 2024 is no stranger to already major stocks surging at exceptional rates.
In fact, Super Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ: SMCI) involvement with artificial intelligence (AI) led to a 253.84% YTD rise and MicroStrategy’s own connection to Bitcoin saw it surge 148.79%.
Conversely, should BTC fail to meet post-halving expectations and offer only a middling rally, Marathon Digital is in danger of plummeting back into penny stock territory on fears of evaporating profitability.

The Crisis Between Binance and Nigeria Continues! Counteraction from Binance Manager! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Tigran Gambaryan, one of the detained executives of Binance, has initiated legal action against the Nigerian National Security Advisor and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged violation of his fundamental human rights.
Binance Manager Tigran Gambaryan Filed a Lawsuit Against the Nigerian Government Following His Detention
According to local news, Gambaryan filed the lawsuit, arguing that his detention after arriving in Nigeria in February and subsequent confiscation of his passport violated the country's constitution, which guarantees the right to personal freedom.


According to Punch News published in Nigeria, Gambaryan's application demands that his passport be returned immediately and that the Nigerian authorities apologize to him.
As Binance's head of financial crimes compliance, Gambaryan's legal challenge highlights the seriousness of his situation and the urgency of addressing allegations that his rights have been violated.






In a parallel development, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's Africa regional manager and another person detained with Gambaryan, reportedly filed a similar complaint.
Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, both foreign nationals, arrived in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, on February 25 and were immediately taken to a government facility the next day. According to Punch, they were detained there after meeting with Nigerian authorities.


Amid these legal battles, the Nigerian government has escalated its stance against Binance, filing four tax evasion charges against the global cryptocurrency exchange.
The Federal Supreme Court of Nigeria ordered Binance and two executives to appear in court on April 4.





According to Nigeria's Vanguard News, Nigerian authorities also announced that they intend to enlist Interpol's help to capture Anjarwalla for trial.

Zero-Knowledge Large Language Models [zkLLMs]: Revolutionizing Privacy in the AI Ecosystem

We are aware of the fact that encrypted data is the heart of the decentralized ecosystem right? In the sense that there is a system that essentially relies on anonymity and privacy. And so naturally as the ecosystem grows we can easily assume that the need for performing computations on encrypted data with the power of AI algorithms has seen a rise.
This in turn has also brought up the charts for the demand for privacy-preserving systems, don’t we agree? This is where zkLLMs step in, my fellow degens!
Okay, let me tell you that if you and I were to enter a prompt to run a computation using an AI engine there can be two major things that would determine the quality of that computation. Want to know what are those?
Well, they are obviously the privacy (of the prompt provided, the parameter on which the computations happen and output data generated) and also mind you the efficiency of actually running that computation. 
Zero Knowledge Proofs works for the privacy of the data so that it is preserved and talking about the Large Language Models (aka the trained Machine learning models) these basically ensure that the computation is done efficiently within seconds by an algorithm trained on an incredibly massive amount of data. Do you get it? 
Zero-Knowledge Large Language Models (zkLLMs) are a way forward to keeping user data supremely private while utilizing powerful AI models you know. Built on none other than regular LLMs, ZK LLMs make use of zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) to make sure the AI model processes user data correctly without ever actually seeing it. 
Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs (zkPs)
For the uninitiated let me tell briefly that Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) of the truth of a statement without revealing literally anything about the statement itself. Well imagine how precious it can be in situations where privacy is a concern, am I right? 
To provide you degens an overview of what is the function on ZKPs, I’d say that they–
Preserve the Privacy of Our Data
Yes, the importance of zero-knowledge proofs lies in the fact that the prover never reveals the underlying information used to prove the statement. So it is comparable to proving you’re over 21 without showing your ID you know. In that situation, a ZK proof allows you to literally demonstrate this using a cryptographic protocol which ultimately ensures that your date of birth remains confidential. 
Verify Our Computations
ZKPs have also proved to be important in verifying the accuracy of computations performed on sensitive data. Is it that crucial, you ask? Well yes because simply knowing the outcome doesn’t guarantee the computation was done correctly. I mean imagine a situation of outsourcing a complex financial calculation and a technology like zero-knowledge proof that allows the recipient to verify the answer without ever needing access to the original financial data.

Nevertheless, if you decide to nerd out on zero knowledge proof then here is your ultimate guide to understand this concept more deeply.

Machine Learning and ZK Proofs: A Perfect Match
For us fellow degens living under a rock let me tell you that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have been on fire lately and the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple are all turning to this new tech. 
Machine learning is essentially where algorithms are trained on different data sets to make predictions or answer queries you know. These algorithms learn from a large set of data and ZK proofs can help them protect the privacy of the data.
Now the interjection of zkP + ML = zkML is way too cool to be missed out on. zkML allows the machine learning model to learn from the data provided without you know it being ever exposed for privacy and security reasons.

Here’s the complete walk-through of this nascent technology called Zero Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) that everyone talks about to have improved the state of AI/ML.

Traditionally speaking training machine learning models often naturally required access to incredibly vast amounts of data which may contain sensitive information. And this is where zk proofs stepped in to bridge the gap of privacy (as well as data security) in providing sensitive information by allowing these models to be trained and used without revealing the underlying data. 
Now you might wonder what are LLMs then? Well Large Language Models aka LLMs are a kind of Machine Learning Models which are trained on certain data of certain logics. 
Let’s get a deeper understanding of LLMs before we see how they interact with zk Proofs, shall we?
What Are Large Language Models?
A diagram illustrating the interaction between a user’s prompt, a large language model, and its training data, demonstrating the cycle of input and output in AI language processing.
Well, Large Language Models (or LLMs) are machine learning models that are you know explicitly trained on incredibly huge amounts of data to understand the complexities of language. These ML models use deep learning techniques to process and analyze natural language text and this understanding ultimately leads them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to our queries or prompts.
LLMs are used in a wide range of applications including language translation, text generation and sentiment analysis. Some well-known examples of LLMs include:-

GPT-3.5/4
BERT 
Transformer models 

While we can agree to the fact that machine learning has been going rogue it is also agreeable that combining the fruits of Zero Knowledge Proofs and LLMs can bring unimaginable feats to the computer world. And zkLLM for the real world is like hiring a digital accountant or an assistant with the help of whom you can get your accounts done and books maintained but you don’t even have to expose your data and neither does the virtual assistant reveal their trade secrets (algorithm).
Now join me in the journey of learning how this synergy between ZK Proofs and LLMs works!
zkP + LLM = zkLLM, What Is It?
You know ZK proofs can be used by LLMs to prove the existence of non-explicitly programmable properties of the input. I know that sounds intimidating. Well, what I’m trying to say is that an LLM could prove a sentence conveys a specific sentiment (e.g., sarcasm) without revealing the underlying algorithms used to determine that sentiment you know. This opens doors for more nuanced and privacy-preserving applications of LLMs.
While ZK proofs are important enough for proving the correctness of computations in zkLLMs, they alone cannot handle the complex computations required by these powerful AI models. This is where Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) comes into play.
Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Computing on Encrypted Data
Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a cryptographic technique, by the use of which computations can be performed on encrypted data directly. Yes, you heard it right! Now computers have the super power to perform computations without decrypting the data itself. 
The FHE method ensures the security of the data throughout the computation process. This technique has the potential to revolutionize the field of secure computing. Tt enables computations on sensitive data to be performed on data without ever revealing the underlying information itself. 
Imagine a locked box with special properties. You can put your data inside and perform computations without opening the box. FHE allows zkLLMs to do calculations or operate on encrypted user data. The LLM can perform complex tasks like sentiment analysis or text generation on the encrypted data itself, without ever decrypting it.
When it comes to saving privacy, zkPs and FHE work hand in hand and complement each other working towards the same goal. 
zkP and FHE: The Ultimate Powerhouse of Privacy Preserving
Zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) are two powerful tools that when used together can create a privacy-preserving powerhouse.
As we already know zkPs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) the truth of a statement, without revealing any additional information about the statement itself. FHE on the other hand, allows computations to be performed directly without decrypting the data. This is useful in situations where privacy is a concern. 
ZK proofs and FHE form the backbone of zkLLMs. Here’s how they work together:-

FHE encrypts the user data. This ensures the data remains safe throughout the process.
The user performs asks the LLM to perform computations on the encrypted data. zkLLMs are designed to work efficiently with FHE for these computations.
ZK proofs prove that the asked queries/computations were solved correctly. The LLM proves it processed the data as instructed without revealing the data or the intermediate steps.


Learn about the new way of thinking about cybersecurity that’s going rogue lately known as zero trust architecture (ZTA) in this comprehensive article by DroomDroom.

As we go deeper into understanding zkLLMs, one thing we need to keep in mind is the value of zkLLMs is created because decisions based on vast amounts of data are made securely and privately within seconds. To quote again ‘Within Seconds’.
The use of LLMs is of no value if the decisions are taking more time than they’re supposed to. Combining LLMs with zkProofs can sometimes cause an overload, making the time taken to perform a particular computation long. 
Don’t scratch your head over it though. The answer to the problem we are facing it lies in some brilliant data quantization mechanisms that help us reduce the presented data to fewer bits ultimately improving efficiency and getting us back to speed.
What are Quantization Techniques & How do they work?
Data Quantization techniques are like data compression methods. These methods essentially reduce the number of bits required to carry a piece of information. This translates to smaller file sizes and faster processing. So to keep it sweet and simple, quantization plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of zkLLMs.
Here’s how quantization techniques work. 
zkLLMs work with large stacks of data to deliver intelligent responses. However, the movement of this data and processing of this data can be time-consuming and expensive. Quantization techniques my friends, are the angels in this disguise. These techniques shrink the size of this data so that fewer bits are required to carry that data.
For Example:-

Numbers can be rounded or compressed to a smaller range to reduce the size of detail
Similar data points can be grouped and assigned a single codeword

Once smaller data packers are created, this enables faster movement of the data. This means less data to store means less space needed, and less data to process translates to faster computation and lower power consumption for zkLLM operations. 
Cerberus Squeezing (along with zkLLMs) is one such method used by the BasedAI network in their approach to speed up the computations made by their AI network engines. 

Hitesh an active member of the crypto community, brilliantly explained on X platform how BasedAI is a prime example of the the excellence of zkLLMs. Hitesh went on to explain that
BasedAI is a system that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to process information while keeping user data confidential. 
The company achieved this through a combination of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and a technique called Cerberus Squeezing. With FHE the data stays encrypted even during computations and Cerberus Squeezing ensures that the process is done with efficiency and avoids and slowdowns.
BasedAI creates a decentralized network where users interact with miners and validators through “Brains”. These Brains are basically nothing but containers that can run modified LLMs. The network gives incentives to partners in order to maintain high performance through a reward system based on $BASED tokens.
Some Other famous techniques include Uniform, Non-uniform, Scalar and Vector Quantization.
Now that we have determined how zkLLMs work we have solved the problem of efficiency. Let’s take a look at some real-world use cases for zkLLMs.
Real-Life Use Cases of zkLLM 
In today’s world privacy and powerful AI capabilities are both necessary. zkLLMs are a relatively new concept, but their applications hold some promise for real-life situations.  
Here let’s take a look at some real-life situations where zkLLMs can be applied:-
Secure Medical Diagnosis
Example of application of zkLLM in Healthcare

zkLLMs can be very useful in the healthcare industry. Suppose a patient uploads their medical records to a Cloud-based AI system. zkLLMs could analyze the data while keeping the sensitive patient information still encrypted and still identify any potential health issues. This protects patient privacy while allowing for advanced AI-powered diagnosis.

One of the primary uses of zkLLMs could be to analyze user’s encrypted financial data. Data from bank statements and investment portfolios can be scanned by the LLMs and asked to provide financial advice based on that. The LLM could identify investment opportunities without ever decrypting the financial information.
Secure Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
zkLLMs can also be used to power chatbots and virtual assistants. These bots can solve the queries of a user magically within seconds! What’s more?, the query still remains encrypted which means that the privacy of the user is maintained as well.
Private Content Moderation
Another great application of zkLLMs could be to analyze, identify and remove harmful or inappropriate content on the internet. The Large language Model operates on the encrypted chats to identify any violations or inappropriate data. On the other hand, ZK proofs can be used to show that the chats were scanned correctly. 
Secure Scientific Research
zkLLMs can be used to analyze sensitive scientific data such as genomic data and other research findings.

Conclusion
Zero-knowledge Large Language Models (zkLLMs) show that AI has taken a significant leap forward by offering language models that prioritize user privacy. Combining the strengths of zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption zkLLMs ensures that computations are performed correctly in a secure manner. 
That’s amazing, isn’t it? this outright opens doors to a wide range of privacy-preserving applications across various sectors. Even though the zkLLM technology is still in its early stages, the potential benefits are undeniable. As the technology moves forward, it makes way for a more secure and privacy-aware digital future.

Dogwifhat takes third spot in meme coin rankings by market cap - Crypto Briefing




Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced a significant surge this week, overtaking Pepe to become the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization.Based on data from CoinGecko, WIF now has a market cap of $3.6 billion, following Shiba Inu’s $18.2 billion (SHIB) and Dogecoin’s $31 billion (DOGE). The dog with a hat meme token has outranked Pepe, which has a market cap of around $3.3 billion.There is relative stability across crypto markets, but the meme coin category has outperformed other sectors, such as decentralized finance, and exchange-issued tokens, such as BNB.For a brief period, the WIF token touched the $4 level, a feat that has been touted as its strongest daily performance since it launched. Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap, WIF is now on the 38th place.The recent meme coin rally started early Thursday amid speculations of Dogecoin (DOGE) being used on an upcoming payments service of X, despite no official communication from the company. Purchases for DOGE-tracked futures saw a record $2 billion, which may indicate an oncoming period of sustained volatility, although this indication may be skewed with a bias for longs. Other dog-themed meme coins, such as Floki (FLOKI) and BONK, were also seen taking gains as the rally begun by Dogecoin took off, albeit with minimal change.On the macro side, trading firms are warning of a potential pullback in recent gains as Bitcoin and Ether price action showed signs of exhaustion.
“The price rally has been exponential in Q1, and there are signs of exhaustion,” notes Singapore-based QCP Capital. “ETH risk reversals are skewed to the downside at -8%, indicating some fear. Funding and forwards remain very elevated, which means that speculators are still paying high prices to keep their leveraged longs.”
The Solana network over which WIF was created is known for its low transaction costs, and it has since emerged as a preferred blockchain for trading meme coins. The Solana meme coin market has surged by 13% over the past week and more than 40% over the past month, according to data from CoinGecko.The surge in Solana meme coins has also been accompanied by a rise in presale scams. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT has highlighted several presale tokens that have raised concerns due to fraudulent activities and suspicions of being rug pulls.

A monumental movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to the KuCoin exchange has jolted the crypto world awake. Whale Alert, the ever-watchful eye on blockchain transactions, flagged an astounding transfer of over 1.4 trillion SHIB, translating to a market value of approximately $43.5 million. Originating from an enigmatic source, this transfer is not just a numerical feat but a narrative-rich event that potentially foreshadows a significant shift in the Shiba Inu market landscape. The market movements by crypto whales are akin to the deep-sea titans they are named after — capable of creating waves that can either uplift or capsize market trends. The transfer of 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens to KuCoin, therefore, raises a critical question: Is this the prelude to a sell-off, or merely a strategic positioning within the whale's broader market playbook?What remains clear is the indelible mark of whale movements on the crypto ecosystem. As crypto continues to evolve from a niche digital curiosity to a mainstream financial instrument, understanding the motives and consequences of these titanic transactions will be paramount for investors, analysts and enthusiasts aiming to navigate the treacherous yet exhilarating waters of the crypto market.Shiba Inu market scenarioFollowing the transfer, SHIB's price experienced a slight contraction of 3.35% in the last 24 hours, a move that, while seemingly minor, plays into a larger narrative of market sensitivity to whale activities. Despite this, SHIB's price trajectory over the past month — boasting a 126.42% increase — narrates a tale of resilience and bullish sentiment within the Shiba Inu community.This juxtaposition of short-term decline against a backdrop of monthly gains encapsulates the volatile dance of numbers and sentiments that characterize the crypto market. It prompts a deeper reflection on the intrinsic value and speculative dynamics that drive the pricing of meme coins like SHIB.The significant transfer to KuCoin does more than just stir speculative debate; it illuminates the profound impact whales can have on the liquidity, volatility and overall health of the crypto ecosystem. Such movements are not merely transactions but signals that can sway market sentiment, trigger speculative trading and even reshape the strategic landscape of exchanges and DeFi platforms.

Crash incoming? Ripple to unlock 1 billion XRP on April 1


Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger development, will unlock 1 billion XRP tokens on April 1, worth $628.5 million. This is part of Ripple’s monthly sell-offs, which could negatively impact the XRP price in the following weeks.
Historically, Ripple has been unlocking 1 billion tokens through escrows, finalized on the first day of every month since 2017. April will mark the start of a new epoch for XRP’s inflation, using different accounts from the past few years.
So far, the company has been using ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23),’ according to XRPScan, as reported in March’s unlock.


Now, ‘Ripple (10)’ will unlock 100 million and 400 million XRP, while ‘Ripple (11)’ will do two unlocks of 200 million and 300 million tokens.

What happened after Ripple’s XRP token unlock in March
The escrow system unlocked 1 billion XRP on March 1, from ‘Ripple (22)’ and ‘Ripple (23)’ accounts. Later, Ripple reserved 200 million tokens for March’s sell-off and re-locked the rest in escrows for July and August 2027.

However, the company spent 240 million XRP from its treasury account, ‘Ripple (1),’ in March, using old reserves. The sell-offs occurred in two batches, all sent to the same address, ‘rP4X2…Kxv3’.
As developed, Ripple sent the 200 million XRP to its reserves on March 1. Further, the payment protocol made one transaction of 100 million tokens on March 5 and one of 140 million XRP on March 13.

XRP price analysis amid sell-offs
It is notable how Ripple’s previous sell-offs could have impacted the XRP price. Finbold placed each of the company’s selling activities year-to-date on XRP’s daily chart.
Interestingly, only two out of eight days had a slightly positive price action. Yet, even these ‘green’ days were made of shy gains, while the negative ones were more impactful.

As of writing, XRP trades at $0.6285 while maintaining a range above the $0.60 support and below the $0.65 resistance. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s selling activities in April after unlocking more than $628.5 million worth of tokens.

Solana-fueled 'memecoins to billions' - Here's what this exec has to say - AMBCrypto



More memes are crossing the billion-dollar valuation marks.
Key crypto figures blame the SEC and TradFi for the meme frenzy. 

Memecoins, especially within the Solana [SOL] ecosystem, recorded explosive growth in Q1 2024. At the time of writing, the community-driven Dogwifhat [WIF] was up 30% on the weekly chart.
 It briefly touched $4 and flipped Pepe [Pepe] to become the third largest memecoin by market cap. WIF, which started as a Solana native meme, is now worth $3.6 billion in market cap. 
The ecosystem now boasts two unicorn memes, WIF and Bonk [BONK], with over $1 billion in market cap. Out of the $67 billion memecoin total market, the Solana ecosystem accounts for $8 billion, translating to about $12% stake. 
Memecoin rally: Did the SEC/TradFi influence it?
Memecoins are now billion-dollar gems to seasoned speculators. Reacting to the crazy billions in the meme sub-sector, Messari Co-Founder Dan McArdle quipped,
“The SEC makes it illegal for people who aren’t already rich to try and get rich from early-stage companies & projects.
Result: memecoins to billions.”
Arthur Hayes, founder and former CEO of BitMEX exchange, had similar observations. In a February newsletter championing the “Points System” for crypto projects, Hayes underscored how retailers get raw deals in traditional markets. 
“But without a hungry hoard of retail buyers who are excluded from investing earlier at much cheaper prices, there would be no buying pressure to create a successful IPO. That is why retail participation must be saved for the end and not the beginning of the fundraising lifecycle.”
Retailers are excluded from discounted prices so that companies can dump shares at them during the IPOs (Initial Public Offerings). 
On the contrary, crypto allows any retailer to join early, like during the Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering), yield farming, points, etc. 
On memecoins, Hayes recently stated that trading Slerf [SLERF] and BOME is “more fun” than “negatively yielding bonds.”
However, another user had a contrarian stance: “Meme coins are really just communities of traders that have agreed to compete to take each other’s money using price action.”
Despite what drives them, memes are now billion-dollar gems and have outperformed some legacy projects in Q1. However, they need great due diligence because they are not risk-free.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds At A Pessimistic 25%: Bloomberg Analyst | Bitcoinist.com


								Analysts’ optimism on the likelihood of Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval in May is constantly waning, as the once optimistic senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has lowered his prediction for the products being approved to a mere 25%.
Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds Continues To Drop
Eric Balchunas, who noted that his chances of having an Ethereum ETF approved in May by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are still a bleak 25%, expressed his pessimism in an X post. According to Balchunas, he would probably go lower if he could do so, suggesting how uncertain the analyst is towards the products.

The Bloomberg expert’s insights coincide with his colleague James Seyffart’s post regarding Bitwise Invest’s latest Ethereum ETF filling. On Thursday, Bitwise Invest registered shares of its ETH ETF with the SEC using a Form S-1 registration statement, which is its first stage of applying for the exchange products.
A 19b-4 form, announcing the firm’s intention to list the ETF on a stock exchange, was filed after this one. Bitwise plans to issue shares of the ETH investment vehicle on NYSE Arca, according to the 19b-4 modification filing that was submitted to the SEC.
Both filings preceded amid rumors that the SEC was attempting to classify ETH as a security under its regulatory scope, raising concerns about future listings of the ETH ETFs. Bitwise Invest is the latest asset company to join the ETH ETF race, indicating the firm’s confidence about an approval by the May deadline.
Even though some in the cryptocurrency world welcomed this move as a hint that regulations would soon approve it, experts like Eric Balchunas are still not convinced, warning that the likelihood is still slim.
Balchunas stated that he has been getting tagged in tweets about Bitwise’s latest filing, the ETH Correlation study, and other ETH ETF hopium. Despite his high regard for the developments, he still believes that the odds for approval are very low.
Furthermore, with seven weeks remaining until the May deadline, Balchunas noted that the SEC’s radio silence is still depressing. “Again, personally I want them to approve but I also want to get the call right so we will be a perfect 4 for 4 in crypto ETF predictions,” he added.
New Correlation As Part Of Bitwise’s ETH ETF Filing
It is worth noting that Bitwise’s recent spot Ethereum ETF filing includes the release of a new correlation analysis. This marks the first ETH correlation analysis to imitate the precise assessment process of Bitcoin (BTC) by the SEC, providing a promising outcome.

Several studies were conducted by Bitwise in order to mirror the SEC’s evaluation of Bitcoin specifically. These include the same 2.5-year sample period, exact intraday correlation intervals, the same correlation statistic, and others.
For hourly, one-minute, and five-minute correlations, the differences in correlation values across the whole sample period are limited to 0.2%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.

'Black Swan' Author Nassim Taleb Reveals Own Sam Bankman-Fried Verdict


Renowned author and financial expert Nassim Taleb has sparked widespread interest and debate with his recent commentary on the verdict handed down to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.Taleb, best known for his bestselling book "Black Swan," took to social media to share his thoughts on Bankman-Fried's 25-year prison sentence for fraud.Taleb's remarks, made in response to a statement by Bankman-Fried expressing remorse for his actions, suggest a deep skepticism regarding the sincerity of the convicted businessman's repentance. Without directly addressing the specifics of the case, Taleb's comment implies a concern that Bankman-Fried may be more focused on his own situation than on the victims of his fraudulent activities. The trial, which concluded in November 2023 with Bankman-Fried being found guilty on all seven counts, revealed a staggering sum of $8 billion fraudulently obtained from FTX customers. Despite the evidence presented by prosecutors, Bankman-Fried maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings.Collapse of FTXFTX, once valued at $32 billion and ranked as the fourth-largest crypto exchange globally, faced significant financial turmoil following investigative reports exposing its precarious financial state. The revelation triggered a mass exodus of investors, ultimately leading to the exchange's collapse and declaration of bankruptcy.Bankman-Fried's legal troubles began in December 2022 when he was detained in the Bahamas at the request of the United States. Initially released on a staggering $250 million bail, his subsequent return to custody followed accusations of witness tampering, culminating in yesterday's sentencing.

21Shares president ‘less bearish’ than Cathie Wood on ether ETF approval - Blockworks


Executives at two of the issuers jointly looking to launch a spot ether ETF have differing views on whether such funds will gain near-term approval. 
Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said this week during a podcast with Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz that “the probability is probably going down” for the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and other similar products, to be approved in May. 
Industry watchers expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule on spot ether proposals on or around May 23 — the date when the regulator’s 240-day clock to decide on the first such applications expires.  
“One of the tell-tale signs for bitcoin that something was gonna happen with the spot bitcoin ETF was the fact that we were communicating with the SEC,” Wood said. “I just think that the SEC is still biding its time, maybe studying the issues.”
Read more: Ether ETFs coming in May? Here’s why many are bearish
The SEC approved 10 spot bitcoin ETFs in January — the first products of their kind to hit the US market. 
Ark Invest partnered with European crypto ETP specialist 21Shares to launch one of those BTC funds. That ETF currently has roughly $3 billion in assets under management, the fourth-most in the segment behind Grayscale Investments, BlackRock and Fidelity.  
21Shares co-founder Ophelia Snyder noted the main reason that bitcoin ETFs were approved: a Grayscale legal victory over the SEC last year. Judges ruled in an August decision that the SEC allowing bitcoin futures ETFs, but blocking the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from becoming an ETF, was “arbitrary and capricious.”
The SEC allowed ETFs that hold ether futures contracts to start trading in October.
Given “how fresh most of the documentation is,” Snyder told Yanowitz she is less bearish than Wood and others around the chance of spot ether ETFs gaining approval soon.    
“There are not a lot of differences between these filings for Ethereum and the filings for bitcoin,” the 21Shares executive noted. “They’re the same structure, the same custodians, the same disclosures. It’s very internally consistent. That means there’s less to look at.” 
Still, Wood said she believes the language in proposals around staking the planned funds’ assets has been “a sticking point” for the SEC. 


Staking ether is the process of depositing ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain — and earning yield on that ETH for doing so.
An amended proposal filed by Ark and 21Shares last month said the sponsor “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the trust’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers.” Fidelity and Grayscale have made similar additions to their ether ETF applications.
Read more: Ark 21Shares amends spot ether ETF proposal to include staking language
Bitwise filed for a spot ether ETF Thursday, though its proposal did not include details about the fund potentially staking its assets. 
Marshall Beard, chief operating officer at Gemini — a custodian for VanEck’s spot bitcoin ETF and in discussions related to the proposed ETH funds — previously told Blockworks he believes spot ether ETFs that stake assets are “not going to be version one.”
ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy argued that staking is a feature that makes ether look more like a security, “which the SEC won’t look favorably upon,” he noted.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is another issuer with a spot ether ETF proposal in front of the SEC. The company’s CEO, Larry Fink, noted during a Thursday interview with Fox Business News that the designation of ether as a security or commodity might not have a big impact on whether such a fund gets greenlit.
When asked directly during the interview whether BlackRock could launch a spot ether ETF even if ETH is labeled a security, Fink added: “I think so, yeah.”

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Talked About Memecoins! He Explained What Kind of Projects He Prefers! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed the topic of memecoins in a thought-provoking blog post published today, sharing his views on their potential to positively contribute to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Defends the Positive Impact of Memecoins in the Cryptocurrency Space
Known for his influential role in shaping the Ethereum network, Buterin emphasized his personal stance on memecoins, stating that he prefers projects that comply with certain moral principles.


He expressed disapproval of coins associated with totalitarian ideologies, fraud, or other negative connotations that may bring excitement in the short term but lead to disappointment in the long term.
While Buterin acknowledged the recent surge in memecoins and the controversy surrounding some of them, especially those that perpetuate racism or offensive themes, he also acknowledged the crypto community's desire to have fun and participate in light-hearted projects.





However, he advocated for a balance, calling for a proliferation of “very good memecoins rather than bad memecoins.” Buterin emphasized the importance of memecoins contributing positively to the ecosystem rather than merely enriching insiders and producers.

He suggested that memecoins that support public goods or charitable causes could be compatible with this vision, offering an example of how such projects could have a beneficial impact.


Buterin's comment comes amid ongoing debates regarding the role and impact of memecoins in the cryptocurrency industry.
While some, such as CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju, have expressed concerns about memecoins overshadowing legitimate projects and damaging the industry's reputation, others, including Buterin, see potential for positive contributions if executed responsibly.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sparks controversy with "crypto villains" remarks

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin startled the cryptocurrency world by naming names of those he called “crypto villains” in a recent social media post. Mark Karpeles and Kyle Davies, two individuals who have made lasting contributions to the profession despite having very different motivations, were named, among others.Mark Karpeles: Redemption from Mt. Gox?After leading the now-famous Mt. Gox exchange for a while, Mark Karpeles was involved in controversy when the exchange crashed in 2014, leaving a path of financial devastation. After being detained by Japanese police the next year, Karpeles came under much more scrutiny and was involved in a protracted four-year judicial fight.Despite his turbulent background, Buterin thinks Karpeles deserves a second opportunity and bases his forgiveness on his current actions. On the other hand, opinions about whether Karpeles’s recent efforts are enough to offset the consequences of Mt. Gox’s collapse are still mixed.The Three Arrows Capital debacle and Kyle DaviesKyle Davies, a co-founder of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), is at the opposite end of the spectrum. The failure of the hedge fund in 2022 rocked the sector and caused ripple effects that affected the whole cryptocurrency scene. Buterin and other community members have harshly criticized Davies for his role in meme cryptocurrency transactions and his attention-seeking actions after filing for bankruptcy.Even though Karpeles and Davies have different stories to tell in the cryptocurrency world, they have come to symbolize the difficulties and disputes that come with the fast development of the sector.The founder of the once-dominant FTX exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, was recently imprisoned, highlighting the unpredictability and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. In response to disclosures of financial instability and investor withdrawals that precipitated FTX’s bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Formerly regarded as a behemoth in the cryptocurrency exchange space, FTX’s collapse should teach industry insiders and investors about the dangers of uncontrolled markets and rampant speculation.Managing cryptocurrency’s futureThe inspiring lessons learned from the repercussions of monumental scandals, scams, or crashes act as a cautionary tale and a reminder of the importance of responsible, transparent, and involved management in the crypto space as it evolves. But there are people, their names Karpeles, Davies, and Bankman-Fried, who can be considered undesired outsiders, and their mistakes show that it is recommended to have stricter ethical principles and governmental control over them to avoid the repetition of these events one day.As a crypto community, we are debating deeper fundamental questions such as the source of accountability, who exercises governance, and the prospects for decentralized finance as we navigate Buterin’s controversial comment and continue to face the impacts of previous scandals.One thing is certain as participants from all over the world struggle with these issues. Nevertheless, the fate of cryptocurrencies is not only about technical matters but it’s also about the morality and personality of the people who play a part in the process of their design. The question of whether the recognition gained from past failures will be the key to developing the upcoming digital economy with sustainable high efficiency, has still not been answered.

Solana vs Ethereum: A Detailed Comparison of Two Leading Blockchains

The crucial decision you make in the web3 space is to find the best blockchain and choosing between Solana vs Ethereum can be difficult considering each has its own pros and cons. Solana and Ethereum are two of the most widely known blockchains. The blockchains are often compared to one another but how do they actually differ from one another?
Solana is a blockchain network founded by Raj Gokal and Anatoly Yakovenko claiming to be able to process a maximum of 65,000 tps with the average cost per transaction of $0.00025. On the other hand, Ethereum, first proposed by Vitalik Buterin introduced the world of web3 enthusiasts to smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
In this article you can expect to read about – Solana vs Ethereum, Consensus Mechanisms like Proof of History (PoH) in the context of Solana, Proof of Stake (PoS) in the context of Ethereum, unique features of each blockchain including the difference between Solana and Ethereum related to cost-effectiveness, transaction processing speed, scalability trilemma. So stay tuned to dive deeper!
Solana Vs Ethereum: Choosing the Right Blockchain Platform
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believed that a blockchain cannot possess all qualities i.e. decentralization, security and scalability at the same time. This situation right here is what is referred to as the scalability trilemma. One of these qualities must be compromised. Take the Layer 1 network Bitcoin for example. This compromise is a key difference between Solana vs Ethereum because let me tell you that while Ethereum focuses on security Solana prioritizes scalability.
The Bitcoin network is thoroughly secure with its heavy decentralization amongst numerous nodes. But the chain can only process around 7 transactions per second (TPS). The crux of the matter is that the more users on a platform like Bitcoin, the less scalable it would be. A great example of scalability trilemma, isn’t it? This is where the new blockchain technology, Solana, comes in.
At the heart of Solana’s protocol is proof of history that works in conjunction with proof of stake in reaching a consensus. Thus, it targets mainstream adoption by being energy efficient, immensely fast and extremely inexpensive.
Transactions per second over time
Talking about comparison in the battle of Solana vs Ethereum, the latter is the most favored blockchain and supports its native cryptocurrency ETH which is in the race for the leading altcoin in the crypto industry.
Originally, Ethereum could be mined by miners competing to solve complex mathematical problems so as to validate transactions and create new blocks on the network. This is called “Proof-of-Work” or PoW. However, in September 2022, Ethereum moved on from this consensus mechanism of PoW to “Proof-of-Stake” (PoS) in The Merge upgrade. 

Here’s an extensive article by DroomDroom on how these above mentioned consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake differ.

What Is Solana?
In an extensive research paper named, “A Prototype of Supply Chain Traceability using Solana as Blockchain and IoT” the authors specified definite features for choosing a blockchain that could best fit their prototype for traceability. Out of several reviews of blockchains, they chose Solana. Are you wondering what those specific characteristics are? Here let me list them out for you:

We know that the transaction fee usually depends on the size of the transaction i.e. the larger the transaction size, the higher the fee required to process the transaction. So one requirement was that we could reduce transaction fees by sending smaller transactions at lower processing priority.


The blockchain is able to process data i.e. extraction of data from the blockchain network is faster (high tps) especially where we want to provide real-time data sent to the Supply Chain web application.


Another interesting criterion of requirements includes a blockchain that provides the ability to create smart contracts for event-based automated transactions.


It is obvious that the blockchain network prioritizes security of data, especially the data sent from IoT devices because of it being sensitive.


Last but certainly not least, a chain that provides Development SDK or API.

Our above discussion only results in one conclusion and that is? It all boils down to the fact that: 
Solana is an open-source (completely transparent) blockchain platform with a primary objective of enhancing scalability, typically exceeding the performance of popular blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) while keeping costs low.
What Is Ethereum?
Some define Ethereum as “the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.”
Ethereum is said to have become the first project to expand the use cases of blockchains. It introduced distinctive technologies allowing people to create their own digital tokens and self-sustaining, autonomous applications. This innovation paved the way for: 

Currency assurance through Ether (ETH)
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
Smart contracts
Decentralized finance (DeFi)
Initial coin offerings (ICOs)
GameFi 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

Now, it is important to dive deeper into the comparison between Solana vs Ethereum. Because, evaluating both blockchain in respect to security, decentralization and other unique aspects is vital to understanding the trade-offs.
Solana vs Ethereum: Comparing Different Criteria
You can’t talk about the Solana blockchain without talking about its faster transaction processing speed. Solana blockchain is founded by Intel, Qualcomm and Dropbox engineers who have aimed to en route towards a theoretical limit of 710,000 TPS. 
So to give you food for thought, Solana has a theoretical speed of nearly 65,000 transactions per second which is 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin, 4000 times faster than Ethereum, and 2.5 times faster than the Visa (centralized) network. 
But what are some of the other features that make Solana unique from Ethereum in the race of these two blockchains?

Each blockchain has its own strengths, weaknesses and so understanding these nuances as we go on to compare the unique features of Solana vs Ethereum is important for developers, investors and users in the blockchain space.
The Detailed Breakdown of Solana Blockchain
Solana works it out on a combination of sharding and a novel consensus algorithm to scale horizontally. This is why the blockchain has quickly risen to prominence in the web3 space with its impressive qualities including scalability, low latency and low transaction costs. Let’s explore more of these unique features.
Consensus Mechanism
What sets Solana apart from other dapp-platform competitors like Ethereum? It is its unique approach to the transaction validation process. This approach also helps the chain to achieve its insane level of speed and scalability. 
Solana uses Proof of History (PoH) consensus combined with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to validate info with timestamp proving an event occurred at a specific time. This mechanism helps avoid this one problem which is experienced on other blockchains – inefficiencies in how the transactions are processed because of the temporary disagreement of the order transactions being submitted.
Proof Of History consensus mechanism is guided by Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). VDF helps in identifying the time when specific events occurred and makes consensus a faster process. 

VIDEO

All events and transactions in Solana are hashed with SHA256 to keep data secured and encrypted. So, PoH adds the timestamp into the SHA256 record – recognized by everyone using Solana. The verification and transparency of transactions is so evident that it assists validators to add them into the block without relying on conventional timestamps. 
The result? A network wherein everyone is absolutely in sync with each other.
Sequential hashing process using SHA-256 algorithm, illustrating the generation of unique hashes and counts at each step.
Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
In order to avoid a possible miscommunication that can affect the entire blockchain, a fault tolerance system needs to be implemented. A key innovation introduced by the Solana team is Tower BFT, a PoH-optimized version of PBFT. Tower BFT makes sure that Solana will remain functional even if some of the nodes act maliciously. 
In simple terms, thanks to this innovation, a single node failure does not affect the chain and other nodes can carry on operating.

By the way, do you ever wonder how different blockchains can communicate with each other? If yes then learn about sidechains with this article.

The blockchain can take advantage of a synchronized clock with this technology. Nodes on Solana can eliminate the need to process and store the timestamps of past transactions, thereby creating more room to focus on other aspects of the transaction validation process. 
With Tower BFT, nodes on the network outstandingly increase their timeouts to reach consensus and examine timeouts of other validations as the ledger is a trustless time source.
Turbine
One of the fundamental innovations in the Solana network is the turbine – it’s block propagation technique that takes some inspiration from BitTorrent. With a constant bandwidth per node, it will be a major problem to increase the node count as it directly increases the time necessary to propagate data to all nodes. A scalability trilemma.
And the fact that Solana can be scalable is because of this innovation by the Solana team – the Turbine block propagation algorithm.
Turbine transmits data using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), i.e assists in dividing data into tiny packages, making the transfers easy. According to Yakovenko, the technology implements a random path per packet through the network as leaders or block producers stream their data. They break the block into packets up to 64 KB in size and transmits each packet to a different validator.
The Solana blockchain network with leader, validator and neighborhood nodes involved in data transmission using the Turbine protocol by Anatoly Yakovenko
In an interesting take on solana vs ethereum, Brandon Potts of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures suggested that the difference between the Ethereum and Solana blockchains is their contrasting strengths. 
“Ethereum is going for this bulletproof security model. They are going for more of a settlement layer, more of the high value transactions, if you will. But with Solana, they are going with high speed, low latency, performance and low cost. So I don’t mean to pit those two against one another, but they are starting on opposite ends of the spectrum.”
Gulf Stream
Well, to gain the “mempool-less” transaction forwarding, Solana uses a protocol called Gulf Stream. A mempool is kind of like a waiting area for unprocessed transactions. The validators of a blockchain select transactions from the mempool and later on add them to the network. 

Here’s your extensive guide to understanding the concept of mempool and how exactly it works!

In the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the number of unprocessed or unconfirmed transactions is somewhere around 20,000-100,000 as shown above and this typically results in significant bottleneck with the mempool rising.
For Solana, every validator knows the order of upcoming block producers and so, the transactions are forwarded to the expected leader ahead of time.

In case you are wondering about the blockchain network congestion scenario, DroomDroom’s article is here to give the gist of it all.

Sealevel
Co-founder of Solana describes Sea Level as, “What we’ve built in Solana is a runtime that can process tens of thousands of contracts in parallel, using as many cores as are available to the Validator.”
Basically, Solana facilitates several smart contracts to operate in parallel and amplifies the computing capacity of its network without negatively affecting the speed of the blockchain.
Pipelining
It is never enough to just form consensus for quick transaction processing. There has to be a way to validate massive blocks of transactions ASAP, while also replicating them across the network at the quickest. For this, the Solana network uses an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining.
Solana Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), a four-stage pipeline that processes transactions efficiently.
This is a technology in which the input data is required to be processed by a sequence of steps across many hardware devices. So using an analogy for this, we can understand that the washer is stage one, followed by the dryer and the last one is the folding stage. 
For maximizing efficiency you will add a third load of laundry to the washer right after the second is in the dryer and the first load is being folded, correct? Putting this analogy to test in Solana, the network ensures that all hardware (the network cards, the CPU cores and the GPU cores) is busy all the time.
Cloudbreak
To understand this concept you need to first have an overview of sharding. 

Consider this article by DroomDroom on the Role of Ethereum Sharding in Building Blockchain’s Efficiency for the same.

So sharding allows the scaling of a blockchain like Ethereum by splitting the blockchain into smaller “shards.”
Solana uses a horizontally-scaled account database i.e. Cloudbreak which empowers it to write data to and read data from the database for concurrent transactions. This all combines to create Solana the world’s first web scale blockchain. The concurrent reads and writes are possible between the 32 threads  through memory-mapped files.
One Last Thing About Solana: SOL Token
A SOL is Solana’s native token can and there are 424,333,409 SOL coins in circulation. SOLs are passed to nodes in a Solana cluster (set of validators) in exchange for running an on-chain program. It is currently ranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization of $26,838,550,394.
SOL works like a utility token for settling transaction fees and is used for Solana’s staking economy.

Learn more about the coin’s fundamental analysis including the tokenomics and future of the project in this article.

So having explored Solana’s technical aspects let’s now delve into the detailed breakdown of Ethereum Blockchain for highlighting the key differences in the showdown between Solana vs Ethereum.
The Detailed Breakdown of Ethereum Blockchain
Vitalik Buterin co-created the Ethereum blockchain project to tackle Bitcoin’s shortcomings. The Ethereum white paper, published in 2013, outlines the vision for the platform which seems to be enabling more than just digital currency transactions. 
A schematic representation of the Ethereum blockchain architecture, detailing its layered structure from application to storage, including elements like smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and data encryption.
Ethereum introduced the smart contracts — automated immutable “if-then” statements — enabling the development of decentralized applications. Prior to Ethereum, DApp development already existed in the blockchain space but the platforms weren’t interoperable. Buterin believed that unifying the way DApps run and interact was crucial for adoption.
Let us now review what features make up Ethereum blockchain and explore what it offers for this comparison to balance between solana vs ethereum.
Consensus Mechanism
Ethereum blockchain reaches consensus using the proof-of-stake (PoS) algo wherein the validators create news blocks and work together to verify the information these blocks contain. So unlike Bitcoin Ethereum does not rely on Proof of Work for consensus as the original whitepaper proposed a variant called “Ethereum Casper” and now is replaced by PoS that secures the network by requiring validators to stake ETH tokens.

VIDEO
A video to understand blockchain consensus mechanisms.
So talking about the comparison in this battle of Solana vs Ethereum, the former uses PoH mechanism to validate information. 
Nodes and Clients
Ethereum is a decentralized network and so it is obvious that it uses a network of computers called nodes. This network of computers maintain a copy of the blockchain ledger and plays an incredible role in verifying transactions and network security.
Nodes perform tasks like validation, participate in consensus mechanism, store varying amounts of blockchain data and the like.
According to the Ethereum whitepaper nodes are of three main types:
Full Nodes
Full nodes store the blockchain history including all transactions and blocks and you know this allows them to independently verify transacctions and contribute to network security. In an ideal world, running a full node is possible for those who want to be fully independent validators.
Light Nodes
Light nodes offer a more lightweight alternative to the above as they verify transactions by checking block headers which are as we know much smaller than the entire block data. It is needless to say that this is what makes them more efficient in terms of say storage and processing power.
Well, talking more about light nodes it is noteworthy to mention that they cannot participate in consensus processes as they do not posses the entire blockchain history.
Archive Nodes
These nodes are basically the history buffs you know because these nodes are like full nodes with an extra archival function. So they store not only the current blockchain state but also historical data which can be in turn beneficial for research and analysis purposes.
Now, we are going to discuss clients–which are the software program installed a particular node that allows it to connect to the network. Clients are responsible for downloading and managing blockchain data, processing transactions and allows users to send and receive transactions along with interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.
So users like you and me do not directly interact with individual nodes but we use client apps like crypto wallets or dApp interfaces to connect to the Ethereum network.
A node runs two client applications called Exceution Client and Consensus Client. Let’s have a brief explanation of these both.
Execution Client
This type of client processes new transactions on EVM and maintains the current state of network data.
Consensus Client (aka Beacon Node)
On the other hand, these client type utilizes the PoS consensus mechanism to verify information from the execution client and reach network-wide agreement on the validity of the new blocks.
Smart Contracts
These are pieces of code stored on the Ethereum blockchain that can be programmed to execute specific actions automatically when certain conditions are met.
By now the importance of smart contracts has risen to a point that there remains no point in defining these self-executing contracts. These are software programs which are run on individual nodes participating in the network in a language that the Ethereum Virtual machine (EVM) understands. 
And then when you deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain it is uploaded and assigned a unique address so that anyone can interact with this smart contract.

A smart contract after bring coded is verified and audited in a very conventional manner which are time consuming and so artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role to detect anomalies or security breach. Know more about it in this article.

Ethereum Virutal Machine (EVM)
Within the Ethereum architecture EVM acts as a decentralized computer that executes smart contracts on the blockchain. EVM acts like a sandboxed execution environment for smart contracts.
Key Features of EVM include:

Turing Completeness–which means it can theoretically execute any algorithm or program that can allow a wide range of functionalities for smart contracts.


Deterministic Execution of smart contracts–which means that for a given input and state the outcome will always be the same on any EVM.


Isolated Execution as the EVM prevents smart contracts from directly accessing the underlying OS or interfering with other contracts which ultimately helps maintain security and stability.

The EVM does not understand high level programming languages you know and so smart contracts are typically written in languages like Solidity and then compiled into EVM bytecode for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.

Learn more about this programming language called Solidity that was specifically created by the Ethereum blockchain team in this DroomDroom article.

Now talking about the role of EVM in transactions is that each node executes smart contract code on its local EVM once the user interacts with it and since the EVM is deterministic all nodes will drive at the same outcome so you know there’s consistency across the network. And then once a consensus is reached on the outcome the state of the Ethereum blockchain updated.
Ethereum Accounts
Ethereum accounts are basically the entities on the blockchain that can interact with the Ethereum network you know like the foundation for user interaction. There are two main types of accounts on the Ethereum network:

Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)
Contact Accounts

EOAs, secured by private key, are like your bank accounts but obviously for the Ethereum network and user controlled and used to hold ETH, send and receive the cryptocurrency to other accounts and interact with smart contracts.
On the other hand, Contract Accounts are not directly controlled by users but by the code of a smart contract which you know means that they can hold ETH and interact with other smart contracts but their behaviour is dictated by the smart contract code.
One Last Thing About Ethereum: Ether (ETH) Token
ETH is more than just a digital currency at this point it fuels literally the entire Ethereum ecosystem allowing secure transactions to happen and enable dApp development. While Ethereum does not have a maximum supply like Bitcoin there have been proposals to introduce a hard cap on the number of coins issued. As of March 2024, Ethereum coins in circulation is approximately 120.2 million ETH.
The ERC-20 standard provides guidelines for creating tokens with specific functionalities which was proposed in 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller. Ethereum’s token standards extend beyond ERC-20 to include other variants like ERC-777 for tangible tokens with unique features and ERC-721 for NFTs.
Now, ERC-20 tokens are a popular way to represnt assets on the Ethereum blockchain but you know by default when you approve a contract to spend your tokens it can potentially spend all of them so this is where ERC-20 token allowance comes into play. 

Learn more about the ERC-20 allowance and following security best practices in this DroomDroom article.

During the Ethereum Merge in September 2022 there was a significant shift from PoW to PoS for validating transactions and this made Ethereum the top cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.
Conclusion
We have discussed the two prominent players in the world of blockchain technology and pit them up against each other in terms technical aspects between Solana vs Ethereum. So I have explained in the article that Ethereum champions robust security and an incredibly well established developer ecosystem. Its recent transition to Proof of Stake consensus enhances its eco-friendliness but hey Ethereum is still grappling with scalability issues which leads to high transactions fees and slower processing times.
Solana on the other hand priortizes scalability and obviously clearly boasts blazing fast transactions speeds and minimal fees. Its Proof of History consensus mechanism combined with DPoS allows for high throughput. But then i have to also admit that Solana is a younger platform with a smaller developer community compared to Ethereum.
The Solana vs Ethereum debate is not about a clear wonner but it boils down to your specific needs which also underlines the contantly evolving development of blockchains.

Stablecoin delistings in Europe spell change for crypto exchanges, issuers

When the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange delists its leading stablecoin for an entire continent, it raises eyebrows. But this may just be a harbinger of things to come.Expect more disruptions as Europe’s path-breaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulatory regime takes effect at the end of June. Off-shore stablecoins, in particular, may face challenges. But in the long run, MiCA should provide a safer, stronger eco-system for stablecoin issuers and users, sources told Cointelegraph recently.As reported, Seychelles-based crypto-exchange OKX delisted Tether (USDT) trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) ahead of MiCA. “Moving forward, only EUR and USDC trading pairs will be accessible for spot trading,” said OKX in a customer support message.A shifting landscapeMarket observers were hardly shocked by the news. Christian Catalini, the founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cryptoeconomics Lab, said he was “not surprised at all by the delisting,” adding that “the stablecoin landscape will evolve substantially across the globe as new regulation is passed, and we will see entry by new players — many of which won’t be companies that started in crypto and are coming from traditional banking and fintech.” Regarding the OKX news, Arvin Abraham, partner at United Kingdom-based law firm Goodwin Procter, expects more of the same. He tells Cointelegraph: “Post-MiCA [i.e., after June 30], if a stablecoin is no longer compliant, we can expect exchanges to drop it from the exchange for European customers.”Because none of the world’s largest stablecoins are European, it follows that in the EEA, at least, one could see “a significant shifting of the landscape following MiCA coming into effect,” suggested Abraham. Some of the current leaders may have to bow out if they won’t, or can’t, get compliant. Recent: Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations“MiCA, with its stringent requirements for both e-money tokens and asset reference tokens” [i.e., two forms of stablecoins in the new MiCA lexicon] will undoubtedly impact stablecoin offerings in the European Union,” Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, global CEO at France’s Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph, and “we are closely monitoring developments in this area.” The challenge for stablecoin issuers is they will now need to be an EEA entity and authorized as an Electronic Money Institution firm in the EEA. “This is problematic for existing stablecoin issuances, and the timeline is now very short, with June 30, 2024, being the last date to meet the new regulatory requirements,” Graftieaux added. A harder task for off-shore stablecoin issuers?“For non-European [stablecoin] issuers, the requirement for the issuer to have an entity established and authorized in an EU member state is the most significant unique cost,” Abraham noted. But it isn’t just off-shore issuers who will face challenges. “For all issuers, significant additional burdens come from the requirements to maintain 1:1 reserves to cover claims; provide permanent redemption rights to holders of tokens; and for stablecoins with a value exceeding 100 million euro to provide quarterly reporting to their EU home state regulator,” Abraham added.Jon Helgi Elisson, co-founder and chairman of Monerium, a company issuing compliant on-chain fiat stablecoins in Europe, and former chairman of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland, told Cointelegraph that most stablecoins offered in Europe today are not compliant with existing electronic money rules — let alone those that will be implemented June 30 as a result of MiCA.“The e-money directive has been in effect in Europe for more than 20 years,” Elisson said. “Why do you have a market of stablecoins where you have one set of companies that are compliant and one set of companies that are not compliant? That is not a fair thing.”Still, he suggested that it could be “hugely expensive” for some stablecoin issuers to come into compliance. With MiCA, fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only have to maintain a 1:1 ratio of liquid reserves, but they will also have to segregate user’s funds, “meaning that the customer has a claim on the underlying funds,” not the company, said Elisson. Compliance demands will be greater for the larger market-cap issuers. “In the current [pre-MiCA] regulation and law, there is no distinction between the size of issuers,” said Elisson. The same rules apply to smaller and bigger issuers. However, MiCA distinguishes between “significant” issuers and “non-significant” issuers. “You have to put more of your own equity aside against potential losses if you are a ‘significant’ issuer,” Elisson explained.Will there be more changes for off-shore issuers? “The impact of the regulation may result in some challenges for those operating in international markets,” said Graftieaux. “For example, it could result in increased compliance costs, barriers to market entry, and potential conflicts with other jurisdictions’ regulatory frameworks, resulting in policy fragmentation.” Abraham foresees “a significant short-term disruptive effect on the market, as Tether is today the most popular stablecoin globally.” However, over a longer time frame, “other stablecoins would fill the void, and the ecosystem would arguably be safer as these coins would be compliant with MiCA’s strict consumer protection and prudential safeguards.” Crypto exchanges might have to adapt, too. “Some exchanges require stablecoins as an intermediate form of exchange before fiat can be used to purchase crypto or to effect a trade between two crypto assets,” said Abraham. Those stablecoins may not be available to them soon, at least for European customers.Setting an example for crypto marketsStill, Graftieaux emphasized the long-term benefits for investors and markets generally. “With a focus on market integrity and investor protection, these regulatory standards set an example for other markets, which, if followed, will only increase investor confidence.” The MiCA framework has already had an impact in the U.K., Graftieaux added, where the government’s commitment to digital assets has been widely seen “as a clear strategic move to lead the international regulatory stage alongside the EU.” Graftieaux also takes issue with those who claim that MiCA could thwart crypto and blockchain innovation in the EU countries. “While innovation plays a crucial role in the industry, the importance of market stability cannot be overstated.”Ultimately, the new framework “recognizes the revolutionary ability of blockchain technology while also finding a balance in offering legal clarity and certainty,” he continued. Moreover, “This harmonization encourages cross-border innovation through the seamless collaboration enabled between EU states.” Graftieaux told Cointelegraph:“This cross-pollination of ideas will continue to foster technological innovation – just under a more robust set of regulations.”Indeed, some on the continent see MiCA offering an opening for a new generation of stablecoin providers. “We cannot predict market reactions, but one thing is sure: MiCA is a real opportunity for Europe and euro stablecoins,” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO at France’s Societe Generale – Forge, told Cointelegraph, adding:“The European market is dynamic, with a large, mature and sophisticated investor base. All the conditions are in place to allow a move toward rebalancing euro versus dollar stablecoins in the long term.”In sum, with their focus on market integrity and investor protection, the new EU crypto regulations could set an example for other markets — after some short-term pain, of course. The stablecoin sector might also see some new entrants to challenge the dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins.Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s“While MiCA is far from perfect, it provides a starting point for more robust stablecoin regulation. It’s also way better than the current situation in the U.S., where there isn’t any regulatory clarity and new rules are needed to deliver safe and sound stablecoins to consumers and businesses,” said Catalini, adding:“Once there is clarity, we’ll finally know which stablecoins are here to stay and which ones can actually solve real consumer and business needs at scale.”

Centrifuge’s Anemoy Attracts Investment From Celo As Tokenized Treasury Assets Bubble - The Defiant

Celo’s investment follows Frax and Gnosis passing proposals to deploy $20M and $10M into Anemoy.Centrifuge, a leading tokenized real-world assets protocol, has expanded operations onto Celo.Announced on March 29, an unnamed entity from the Celo ecosystem invested $100,000 into tokenized treasuries via Anemoy, a Centrifuge-native asset manager, and allocated an additional $1 million for later deployment.“Celo ecosystem members completed the first Centrifuge RWA transaction on Celo, allocating up to $1M into Anemoy's Liquid Treasury Fund,” Centrifuge said. “We're looking forward to bringing more high-quality assets and liquidity to the Celo ecosystem.”“The Celo ecosystem views Centrifuge as a strategic partner in the wider Celo ecosystem to onramp additional asset classes, like for private credit, which Centrifuge has a long history of bringing on-chain in a safe, compliant way,” said Alex Witt, the former chief financial officer of the Celo Foundation.Centrifuge now operates across five networks, following deployments on Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, and its Centrifuge Chain Polkadot parachain.

The broader digital currency ecosystem is capitulating despite the sustained bullish fundamental that persists in the broader digital ecosystem owing to the spot Bitcoin ETF inflow sentiment. For XRP, the narrative is different as the digital currency has maintained a sheer stagnancy for the better part of the week before recording a mild breakout today.At the time of writing, XRP is changing hands for $0.6284, up by 0.94% in 24 hours. The XRP price is looking to find a balance, an effect that might be solidified by its historic price trends.Data from the crypto analytics platform CryptoRank shows that on average, the XRP price has always traded positively in the month of March. Though there have been more bearish March closures since its inception, the bullish months have massive jumps.In proper context, the 278.1% jump in March 2017 completely negated the 6.7% slump in March 2016 and the 43.3% drop in March 2018. Over the past four years, XRP has always closed March on a bullish note, jumping by 37.7% in 2021, by 4.15% in March 2022, by 43% in March 2023 and by more than 7% thus far this month.XRP Monthly Returns via CryptoRankHopes for XRP price growthPer the CryptoRank data, the average growth of XRP for March comes in at 19.9%, and if history repeats itself, the digital currency may grow by this percentage before the end of this first quarter.The volatility in the market and the impact of the ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit may shape the outlook in the long term. The lawsuit that was brought on in December 2020 has already deprived XRP of hitting its all-time high (ATH) in tandem with multiple coins that have broken their individual records this month.XRP’s utility remains its biggest fundamental and forms the basis upon which many pundits believe the coin may shoot as high as $5.5 in the long term.

Google Introduces Bitcoin Wallet Balances in Search, Sparks Debate | Coinspeaker



With this feature, users can now search for three Bitcoin address formats, P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32, and promptly access the current balances and recent transactions linked to those addresses.

In the latest development, tech giant Google announced that it’s expanding search engine capabilities allowing users to easily monitor their crypto wallet balances just by entering the wallet’s address. As part of this development, Google will support several different blockchains such as Bitcoin, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Fantom.
The feature not only displays the native token balance of a wallet for each supported network but also indicates the most recent update time, offering users near real-time visibility into their cryptocurrency holdings.




For each supported network, this feature will display the native token balance of a wallet in addition to indicating the most recent update time. Thus, Google will offer users real-time visibility into their crypto holdings.
Users will be able to search for three Bitcoin address formats, P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32, and instantly access current balances and recent transactions associated with those addresses. By integrating Bitcoin data into search results, Google has enhanced its accessibility to on-chain activity, while simultaneously capitalizing on its vast daily search volume.
Users Raise Concern over Privacy
Although some users praised Google’s introduction of checking wallet balances instantly, some of the privacy-centric Bitcoin supporters raised concerns regarding this centralized data aggregation and its impact on privacy.
This update builds upon Google’s previous integration of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains and represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Furthermore, it also enhances the accessibility and management of digital assets through the search platform.
Back in May 2023, Google introduced the Ethereum wallet balance searches. In the previous year 2022, Google also integrated a crypto feature allowing the Ethereum wallet addresses to check their Ether balances through the Google search engine.
The inclusion of wallet searches signals a change in the tech giant’s approach. Back in 2018, Google banned Bitcoin-related advertisements, only to reverse its decision recently. It now permits spot Bitcoin (BTC) tickers and advertisements for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following their approval in the United States in January.
Search results on Google now feature ETF products from prominent asset managers such as BlackRock. Additionally, in October 2022, Google collaborated with Coinbase to enable its customers to use cryptocurrency for paying cloud services.
Furthermore, the tech firm also initiated a countdown during the Google Merge event back in September 2022 by featuring animated pandas. Similarly, last year in 2023, google Cloud joined hands with Web3 startup Ordely Network to build user-centric developer tools for DeFi. The goal was to reduce the entry barrier to this field.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Could Hold Above $50 Due to This Group


Avalanche (AVAX) price has been moving sideways for the past two weeks and was expected to continue this way until it found bullish momentum.
However, by the looks of it, the altcoin is set to face bearishness thanks to its own investors.
Avalanche Investors Might Move to Sell
The Avalanche price is currently trading around $53 and preparing for further decline. However, should the altcoin dip, it will take nearly $1 billion worth of tokens out of the realm of possible profits to certain losses.
The Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) metric highlights the supply bought at certain price levels and where it currently stands. Nearly 22 million AVAX bought between $51 and $56 will fall into the clutches of bears should Avalanche price note a fall below $51.

Although the market conditions do play a hand in dictating the price action of the cryptocurrency, Avalanche is facing a much larger threat from its own investors. Specifically, one single cohort of short-term traders. These investors are known to hold an asset in their wallets for less than a month, making it highly susceptible to selling.
At the moment, about 34.15% of the entire circulating supply sits in the hands of these investors.

If they move to sell their holdings to offset any potential losses, Avalanche price could observe a substantial drawdown.

AVAX Price Prediction: Decline is Likely Possible
Avalanche price, trading at $53, is set to lose the support marked at the same price level; this would result in the cryptocurrency likely testing $50. However, should selling intensify or bearish momentum gain strength, this support would be lost too, pushing AVAX down towards $47, which is the confluence with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

On the other hand, if the winds shift, AVAX could flip the 50-day EMA into support from resistance. This could reignite a recovery. This would result in the price continuing its consolidation. Furthermore, the same could even extend to the altcoin, potentially breaching the $58 resistance and invalidating the bearish thesis.

How Does Solana Fix Its Racist Meme Coins Problem?

"This is very much akin to in the United States, when there's a hate group that has 20 members that goes and protests in front of a church. And they're on national news, and it's a big thing. But if you look at it, there's 20 people, and all they want is attention," he said.

Jito (JTO) poised near key level; Is breakout to new all-time high next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Jito (JTO) price bounced off lows of $2.79 and is eyeing new momentum above $3.
A potential cup and handle pattern could see bulls target breakout alongside Bitcoin.
With BTC outlook positive, a rally for JTO could bring a 50% upside from current levels.

Jito (JTO) is looking to extend gains above $3 after bulls bounced off the support zone on March 29.
JTO reached highs of $3.83 on March 16, tracking gains by Bitcoin and top altcoins as BTC reached a new all-time high above $73k and ETH broke above $4,000.
Jito price outlook amid bullish Bitcoin sentiment
Despite paring gains, Jito looks to have established a fresh support zone at $2.75. The resulting upside to above $3.20 keeps the restaking protocol’s price in an uptrend, which has been in place since JTO/USD bottomed in early January.
In this case, the $3.50-$3.75 area looks crucial for bulls.
Although Jito remains in an uptrend, there’s potential for a downward flip if bulls fail to consolidate above $3.
If price climbs to $3.62, the technical picture will represent a cup and handle pattern.  Check the chart below showing the daily price movements for JTO.

Strengthening above this area could see a bullish flip allow for a retest of $4. The key upside target above this level will then be $6. This is the area of the all-time high of $6.01 reached on December 7, 2023 following Binance’s listing of JTO.
On the downside, the main support lies near $2.79 and $2.50. The daily RSI and MACD indicators suggest weakness and these might be key price levels to watch.
Bitcoin price is also poised near the $70k level. As such, traders are likely to pay attention to sentiment around the benchmark crypto. 
Solana (SOL) performance is another factor to consider. Jito is a  Solana liquid staking token that’s seen great interest since its introduction.

                        Hours after introducing Ethena (ENA) on Binance Launchpool, a fake ENA token has been exploited for 480 BNB worth $290,000.According to a report by on-chain security firm PeckShield on Friday, the exploited token is the fake version of ENA.“The token shares the same name as the legitimate ones,” the updated post on X (Twitter), read.Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by market value, added Ethena to its Launchpool, making the synthetic dollar protocol the 50th project to join the platform. The launch enables users to farm the token by staking BNB or FDUSD, the Friday announcement noted.The fake Ethena token exploit, separate from the Ethena Labs initiative, emphasizes robust security measures and due-diligence in token transaction.The news of the exploit spurred confusion among the crypto community on X. PeckShield confirmed users in a separate post that the token is fake and not linked with the legit Ethena.“Clarification: The token mentioned below is not authentic and should not be linked to Ethena in any way.”Ethena Token Airdrop – Highly Anticipated
The news of the fake Ethena exploit comes at a time when the community is highly anticipating the token airdrop which the company announced to take place on April 2. The airdrop marks the next phase in its expansion after the success of its USDe synthetic stablecoin.The protocol has planned to airdrop 750 million ENA tokens, which is 5% of its total supply. Further, the airdrop will apply to eligible participants on April 2 and become available on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs).The company noted that the size of each user’s drop is determined by the amount of “shards” they accumulated through April 1. Shards are digital units measuring users’ engagement with the protocol.Ethena’s USDe amassed a supply of over $1.38 billion, marking a key milestone, per DefiLlama data.

How will the Bitcoin halving impact Bitcoin L2s? - Blockworks


The Bitcoin halving is anticipated to occur in the second half of April this year. Like real-world gold, bitcoin is considered by many to be “digital gold,” with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. As the Bitcoin halving draws near, many are concerned that miners will endure an inevitable revenue cut following the major event.
Mining bitcoin has previously been a profitable way for people to earn rewards while simultaneously securing the network. Fisher Yu is the co-founder of Babylon, a project aiming to create a Bitcoin-secured proof-of-stake economy. He noted the motivation behind early participation in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security, attributing it to the high amount of bitcoin rewards available when the blockchain was first created.
“Nakamoto’s hope is that, over time, Bitcoin becomes very well adopted so that the increase in transaction fee will outrun the reduction in mining rewards, so that miners’ operational costs are well covered,” Yu said.
Read more: Why most bitcoin mining stocks are down amid a persistent crypto rally
Although such a trend is observed, Yu notes that existing transaction fees are not quite sufficient, and there are growing concerns that miners may leave the network, reducing the blockchain’s overall security. 
This belief is shared by Max Chamberlin, the founder of fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramp payments provider Bifinity, who noted that many bitcoin mining businesses could become unsustainable following the halving. 
“While bitcoin’s mining difficulty is dynamic, automatically adjusting to the current hash rate capabilities, it would still be better for the network’s decentralization to have as many miners as possible,” Chamberlin said.

He notes that the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals has boosted on-chain activity significantly and provided miners with a considerable new stream of income through transaction fees, which have so far amounted to almost $240 million.
“In a broader sense, the introduction of ordinals and Runes has sparked considerable excitement within the cryptocurrency community in general, introducing a novel category of tokens — assets that exist directly on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Chamberlin said.
Despite this, Chamberlin is aware that the Bitcoin ecosystem still needs to work on developing broad-spectrum, general-purpose applications, a challenge that stems primarily from the constraints of Bitcoin’s programming language, Script.
“This predicament echoes a longstanding conundrum in finance — the emergence of new assets begs the question of what to do with them,” he said. 
Read more: The history of Bitcoin halvings — and why this time might look different
He remarks that a potential solution to this concern is to integrate assets into DeFi services through Bitcoin layer-2 solutions, which often enable a more complex ecosystem of decentralized applications.
“Bitfinity, a next-gen EVM serving as a layer-2 for Bitcoin and other assets, emerges as a strong contender in this regard. It provides developers with the familiar EVM programming environment but with access to Runes and other Bitcoin-native assets,” Chamberlin said. 
Yu agrees and explains that Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol could alleviate some of the growing concerns around cut rewards. He notes that miners could use their bitcoin to secure its proof-of-stake economy and be rewarded for their security.

Rena Shah shares this sentiment. Shah is the vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, a company that is building a decentralized economy on Bitcoin. She told Blockworks that Bitcoin will likely grow to rely on its layer-2 infrastructure a lot more for most post-halving transactions this year. 
“While the base layer will still focus on high-value settlements, Bitcoin DeFi and other activities will no longer have to use the base layer, as more [layer-2s] start unlocking frictionless usability,” she said. 
She added that “solving transaction times, identity solutions and even wallet functionality between the [layer-1] and [layer-2s] are areas our team at Trust Machines has identified as most appealing to users. As well as DeFi opportunities, which are of particular interest to users of other smart contract-based chains.”

Brace For Market Impact: Ethereum Open Interest Has Reached A New All-Time High


                            Ethereum has, for the most part, established a foothold above the $3,500 price level throughout the week as investors continue to anticipate a return to the $4,000 mark. Interestingly, the optimism has seen the open interest of Ethereum surging to new highs. The surge in open interest, although a bullish sentiment indicator, can also serve as a bearish signal of an impending change in market trend. 
Ultimately, this metric added to the current dynamics of the Ethereum ecosystem, including regulatory uncertainty and scalability concerns hinting at a complicated price trajectory for the price of Ethereum.
Ethereum Open Interest Reaches New High
Open interest is an efficient method for tracking the total number of open positions in a particular contract. Recent market dynamics and institutional investor interest have seen the total open interest in Ethereum futures surging above records set in the 2021 bull market phase.

According to data from Coinglass, the open interest on Ethereum futures, which has been on a surge since February 5, recently set a new high of $14.11 billion on March 15. This wasn’t particularly surprising, as a strong buying momentum from the bulls in the prior days saw the price of Ethereum surging past the $4,000 mark for the first time in two years. 
However, Ethereum has since reversed from the $4,000 price level and is currently trading below $3,600. On the other hand, the total open interest on Ethereum contracts has maintained around its all-time high level, which allowed it to cross over $14.10 billion again on March 28. The open interest weighted average also went up to 0.0462%, indicating an increase in the demand for leveraged ETH long positions.
The majority ($4.55 billion) in the Ethereum futures market were registered on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Bybit and OKX came in second and third, with $2.39 billion and $1.94 billion respectively. Interestingly, CME’s Ether futures also surged to $1.3 billion. At the time of writing, the CME’s Ether futures now sit at $1.31 billion, reiterating the committed bullishness among institutional investors.
What’s Next For ETH?
Ethereum has been trading flat since the beginning of the week and is currently on a 0.78% gain in the past seven days. All eyes are now on reports of the SEC looking into Ethereum’s security status, the industry awaits an official ruling similar to the one that was handed down in the XRP case that will finally provide clarity to the regulatory landscape.

At the same time, investors continue to await the SEC’s decision regarding the applications of Spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. According to a Bloomberg senior analyst, the likelihood of approval is only 25%.

Expert Slams Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Attempt' To Use His Autism Diagnosis For A Lenient Sentence: 'Attempt To Use His Neurodivergence...Is Wrong' - Benzinga

In a recent development, the conversation around Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing has taken a new turn with discussions about his autism diagnosis and its potential impact on his legal consequences.What Happened: Eric Garcia discussed in an op-ed on MSNBC the complex issue of Bankman-Fried’s autism diagnosis and its role in his criminal case.He touched upon the arguments presented by individuals who believe Bankman-Fried’s autism should be considered for leniency in his sentencing. Garcia is the author of “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation.”Among them, Maria Centrella, a parent of an autistic adult, wrote to the court without personally knowing Bankman-Fried, suggesting his actions lacked malicious intent due to his neurotype.Psychiatrist George Lerner, in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, described his patient’s dispassionate discussion about FTX’s collapse, a demeanor he attributed to symptoms associated with autism. Bankman-Fried’s mother also expressed concern about her son’s potential miscommunication risks in prison due to his autistic traits.Garcia, being autistic himself, wrote, “Reading these statements as an autistic person evoked in me conflicting thoughts: The plea for leniency because of Bankman-Fried's neurotype follows a tired trope.”See Also: Former White House Lawyer On DJT: ‘Little Reason To Think That This Deal Will End Well For Anyone Other Than For Trump’Despite the lack of comprehensive data on autistic adults’ interactions with law enforcement, studies indicate a higher prevalence of autism among prisoners and a greater likelihood of deadly encounters with police.“All the same, Bankman-Fried's attempt to use his neurodivergence as a means to escape the consequences of his actions is wrong. The criminal justice system consistently fails neurodivergent people, but Bankman-Fried is not in that number,” Garcia concluded.Why It Matters: The sentencing of Bankman-Fried has been a focal point of discussion, not only for its implications on the individual but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Judge Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, a decision that reflects his ambition and political manipulation. This outcome is particularly significant as the digital asset industry grapples with regulatory and ethical challenges, a topic that will be explored at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference.Amid calls for leniency, including a plea from a parent of an FTX victim who lost $130,000, recommending a six-year sentence, the crypto community has had mixed reactions. The 25-year sentence has been compared to the harsher punishment faced by Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road. This comparison has sparked debate over the consistency and fairness of sentences within the crypto space, as seen in the reactions on X (formerly Twitter).Read Next: American CEO Spills Secrets From Xi Jinping Meeting: China’s President Gave ‘Tough Answers’ On Everything From Economy To Chips To TaiwanImage created using AI via MidJourney

100x Your Gains: 5 Best Cryptos Under $1 for Explosive Growth | Cryptopolitan

After the Bitcoin halving event, analysts anticipate a significant surge in the crypto market, with Bitcoin’s value possibly climbing to an astonishing $200,000. Amidst these bullish predictions, uncovering hidden gems in the cryptocurrency universe remains crucial. The spotlight now shifts to a selection of cryptocurrencies priced under $1, poised for extraordinary growth. These assets may present lucrative opportunities for those looking to amplify their gains in the evolving digital currency landscape.BlastUP Presale: A Beacon of Predictability in the Volatile Crypto SpaceBuying presale tokens may be a good idea, as they are immune to market’s wild swings with their price pinned to a certain level. Predictability is one of the key benefits of presale projects such as BlastUP.BlastUP is the first launchpad on Blast, the only Layer 2 solution with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. In just a few months of its presale, this platform has already raised over $3 million which speaks much for its wide recognition among savvy investors.The fifth stage of BlastUP token’s presale is underway, offering a decent chance to invest in a promising asset at a low price. Currently, the token’s price is 45% lower than its future listing price, so now is the most opportune moment to join the presale.>> Don’t Miss Out!

It is quickly becoming the go-to hub in the Blast ecosystem, with big plans through 2026. BlastUP is about to shake up the crypto scene, so get on board before this rocket ship takes off without you!>> Act Fast! Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited – Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! <<Sei’s 615% Surge: Potential Growth vs. Market RisksThe recent trend shows Sei has significantly grown over six months, with an impressive 615.27% jump. That kind of increase suggests a strong momentum that could continue pushing prices up. If traders remain positive and more buyers come in, we might see the price aiming for the first resistance at $1.05. If that level is overcome, the next target could be the second resistance at $1.27. The all-time high at $1.144 hints that reaching new peaks is possible. However, this needs to be sustained by consistent interest and positive market conditions.On the flip side, Sei has experienced a small dip of 3.33% in the last month, which could indicate a cooling off or normal market fluctuation. The current price sits near the 10-day average, suggesting a neutral stance for short-term movements. If the price falls, it might find support at $0.5964 and further down at $0.3590. Investors should be cautious as the MACD suggests a sell, which could point to a potential short-term decline.  Pyth Network’s Price Surge: $1.18 in Sight?The recent surge in Pyth Network’s price to $0.91, up 24.41% over the last month and 138.11% over six months, shows strong momentum. With prices flirting near historical highs, reaching $1.18 might be on the horizon, especially if enthusiasm continues. Long term, a steady climb past the all-time high of $1.16 seems plausible, supported by growing adoption and positive sentiment in the market.Nonetheless, caution is warranted as the market is cyclical, and what goes up can also come down. If traders begin to take profits, support levels at $0.38 and $0.12 must hold to prevent a significant slide. In the short term, dips could offer buying opportunities, but market dynamics constantly change, and reliance on past performance is risky without considering broader market trends.Cardano Exhibits Growth with Potential RisksCardano‘s recent one-month growth of 4.01% and a significant six-month spike of 155.12% show momentum, suggesting a positive outlook. With a current price of $0.65, near the 10-day moving average of $0.64, there’s a foundation for stability. If it breaks the nearest resistance at $0.75, we could see a move towards the second resistance at $0.85. However, sliding below the nearest support level of $0.52 might pull the price down to the second support at $0.38, raising caution among investors.Considering the all-time high of $3.16, Cardano is currently at a fraction of its peak value. This gap indicates substantial growth potential, attracting long-term investors looking for significant returns. Yet, the 100-day average of $0.60, slightly below the current price, hints at underlying risk. Should the price dip and sustain below this average, it could signal a bearish trend, urging investors to reconsider their positions. Dogecoin Soars Past Averages & Aims HighDogecoin‘s recent jump to $0.224 has outpaced its 10-day average of $0.179 significantly, pointing to strong momentum. In the past month alone, it surged by roughly 130%, and over six months, it ballooned by almost 260%. With these figures, projection toward the first resistance of $0.143 seems conservative, suggesting a further push to the second resistance at $0.168 may follow. Assuming the trend holds, Dogecoin’s upward journey might continue, testing previous boundaries and possibly eyeing its historic peak of $0.7605.However, Dogecoin’s climb has not been straight, and prices can pivot quickly. Its current support levels at $0.085 and deeper at $0.052 are reminders of potential fallbacks. Despite its 100-day average resting at $0.109, current enthusiasm needs to withstand sell-offs that often follow steep ascents.  ConclusionWhile the other coins mentioned demonstrate potential for growth and market traction, BlastUP stands out as the crown jewel in the Blast ecosystem. Its distinctive combination of presale advantages, AI and Web3 integration, and a firm community-driven approach are why many consider it a contender for unprecedented growth. While the success of cryptocurrencies can never be guaranteed, BlastUP’s strong concept and ecosystem synergy appear to distinguish it as the frontrunner in the race toward significant returns on investment.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

The Spring Crypto Rush: 5 Fastest Growers to Watch | Cryptopolitan

After the Bitcoin halving, experts are buzzing about a big surge in crypto prices. Some say Bitcoin could soar to $200,000. High hopes are riding on crypto’s season of growth, much like the vibrant spring bloom. In this atmosphere of anticipation, we turn our focus to a select few cryptocurrencies that are rapidly gaining ground. These contenders are drawing attention from investors looking to tap into the crypto market’s potential windfall.BlastUP Presale Hits $3 Million: Anticipating the Next Big Thing in CryptoBlastUP, the premier launchpad on Blast, has recently made a splash in the crypto world with its head-spinning debut, raising  $3 million in a few weeks. The number of early investors who have already recognized BlastUP’s high potential is growing exponentially.BlastUP is poised to reach roaring success, with plans to empower Web3 tools with AI innovation for fast and quality startup launches. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and a rich rewards system for all those coming on board.Currently, BlastUP is running its fourth presale stage, offering BlastUP tokens at the lowest price. Buying these tokens now at $0.055, you get a hefty discount of 45%, as the listing price is set at $0.1.>> Be Among the FIRST! Get the Exclusive Perks From BlastUP Presale <<Holders of BlastUP tokens may benefit from a number of privileges including allocations for token sales, exclusive loyalty rewards for participating in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest through staking.Following a simple mission to help blockchain startups grow faster and earn more, BlastUP is on its way to becoming a dominant force. The team of dedicated crypto enthusiasts behind the project are deeply committed to their vision and have ambitious plans to become a one-of-a-kind launchpad for easy and efficient blast off in the crypto space.The comprehensive roadmap of BlastUP extends through 2026, outlining plans to launch an AI IDO screener, develop AI tools tailored for startup teams, and set up the Community Marketplace.>> Join BlastUP Presale NOW to Unlock Early Benefits <<Render’s Strong Growth with Caution AdvisedRender has shown a strong one-month climb at 55.21% and an even more impressive six-months surge of 625.44%. Today’s current price is $11.16, sitting just above the 10-day average of $11.04, signaling positive momentum. However, with the nearest resistance level at $11.12, there’s potential for pullback if momentum shifts. Caution should be taken as prices could retreat toward the support at $5.09 or even $2.66, which would be significant drops. The fact that Render is trading above the 100-day average of $6.48 is a sign of strength and could suggest a sustained upward trend. Its all-time high stretches to $13.75, and given the latest prices, aspirations to revisit or surpass this peak seem within reach.  Optimism’s Short-Term Slip vs. Long-Term Growth PotentialThe short-term look for Optimism shows a bit of a slip in the last month, at a small drop of 0.12%. However, we’ve seen a strong bounce over the last six months with a rise of 175.46%. The push above the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) prices of $3.64 and $3.61 suggests some positive energy. With the current price at $3.70, nearby support at $2.95 might hold, but if it slips, we could see a drop to the lower support at $2.20.Longer-term, Optimism has room to grow towards its highest point of $4.86. The near resistance level of $4.32 could break with enough buying power, lining up a move towards the second resistance at $4.95. With a consistent buy signal from moving averages and MACD, there’s optimism in the air.  Aptos Surges 73.62%: Potential to Hit New PeaksAptos has seen a 73.62% rise in the past month and a staggering 214.82% increase over six months. This trend suggests a strong upward momentum, possibly driving prices past the current $17.25. If this growth continues, it could challenge the second resistance level at $18.82 soon. However, the crypto market can be very volatile, and any shift in trader sentiment could lead to a test of support at $9.07, or even $6.41.Looking at the all-time high of $72.56, despite the current price of $17.25, Aptos shows it has significant room for growth. Over the longer term, steady advancements and increasing adoption could push Aptos closer to former peaks. Nevertheless, traders should be mindful of the 100-day average at $10.85, as falling below this mark may indicate underlying weaknesses and potential for further declines. Long-term potential is there, but so is the risk of downturns.Mantle’s Growth: Resilience Amid FluctuationsMantle has been showing impressive growth recently, with a one-month upswing of 35.28% and a six-month leap of 200.60%. Considering the current price of $1.20, Mantle could experience further gains if it pushes past the nearest resistance level of $1.08, which seems likely given the positive technical signals from the MACD and both 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages. However, traders should also be aware of potential fallbacks to the support levels of $0.63 or worse, $0.37. Short-term fluctuations are always possible, and the neutral RSI suggests a potential consolidation phase might be on the horizon.Looking at the longer-term trend, Mantle’s robust six-month price jump suggests a strong bullish momentum, which can be considered a good sign for continued growth. The recommendations to buy from the MACD and the Simple Moving Averages point towards a positive market sentiment for Mantle. Yet, investors must consider the possibility that after such a significant increase, there may be a correction period. The resistance at $1.27 could cap near-term growth and should be closely monitored. ConclusionAs the crypto market enters this exuberant spring, the astonishing presale of BlastUP token draws a veil of optimism for the fintech community. While other coins have undoubtedly showcased potential for growth and profit, BlastUP gleams with the brightest prospects. Nestled within the Blast ecosystem and armed with a unique concept, BlastUP’s ambitious roadmap and integration of AI in Web3 tools position it as a frontrunner for those seeking fresh yet well-grounded opportunities. It’s evident that BlastUP holds a torch for innovation, illuminating a path for blockchain startups to flourish, and signaling a promising horizon for savvy investors.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

April Whale Crypto Picks - Hidden Gems Poised for Surge | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin’s recent halving has sparked excitement in the crypto community, with some experts predicting a major bull run. Values could skyrocket, potentially reaching heights of $200,000. Amidst this optimistic backdrop, savvy investors are on the lookout for the next big thing. This article highlights under-the-radar digital assets that might see significant growth, making them crucial for anyone looking to ride the wave of the expected surge.BlastUP Emerges as a Game Changer Raising Over $3 Million in Few WeeksBlastUP is a unique launchpad platform based on Blast, a legendary Layer 2 blockchain that dominated the headlines with its dizzying start.

BlastUP is gearing up to become the next big thing in the crypto space, so you’d better hurry up and jump on the bandwagon before it is too late.>> Ready to Blast Off? Buy BlastUP Tokens Now and Catapult Your Investments <<Optimism’s Recent Dip Amid 175% 6-Month RallyThe recent performance of Optimism shows a slight dip of 0.19% over the past month, indicating some short-term trading hesitations. However, the six-month rally of 175.29% cannot be ignored. It reflects strong momentum which may continue pulling the price upwards towards the nearest resistance level of $4.32 and beyond. Considering its history of reaching $4.86501702, it’s possible that the current price of $3.70 could be seen as a buying opportunity for those believing in its further growth. Traders would watch the Simple Moving Average (SMA) values at $3.64 (10-days) and $3.61 (100-days), which are currently supporting the price, suggesting the potential for continued upward movement.On the flip side, one must consider the risks inherent in any cryptocurrency investment. The proximity of the nearest support level at $2.95, and the second support level at $2.20, indicate that if negative sentiment overtakes the market, the price could experience a decline. With the current price hovering above these supports, any shift in trader confidence could lead to testing these lower boundaries. The SMA indicators also suggest that if the price drops below them, it could signal a downward trend, inciting a more cautious approach from investors.  Aptos Rally: Over 215% Growth in 6 MonthsAptos has shown a strong uptrend recently, with over 73% gain in a month and over 215% in six months. These substantial rises hint at a growing belief in Aptos’ potential. With its current price at $17.29, above the 10-day average of $16.71, investors may see a chance for growth towards the all-time high of $72.56. However, respect for support levels at $9.07 and $6.41 remains crucial, as a fall below these could signal a shift in trend.Considering the encouraging move above the $13.77 nearest resistance, Aptos displays strength in the short-term, backed by buying signals from the MACD and simple moving averages. As it surpasses the 10-day average, the momentum could carry prices closer to the second resistance at $15.82. While the positive trend is substantial, a long-term outlook should account for normal market cycles, with the 100-day average at $10.85 serving as a humbling reminder of potential volatility.Render’s Soaring Growth: Surpasses Key Resistance LevelsRender has had a remarkable journey with a substantial one-month increase of 55.10% and an even more impressive six-month rise of 624.95%. With the current price at $11.15, surpassing both the simple moving average for 10 days at $11.04 and the 100-day average at $6.47, momentum seems to be on its side. Considering the nearest resistance level is $11.12, which Render has already crossed, the next target might be the second resistance level at $13.72. If the bullish trend continues, testing its all-time high of $13.75 could be within reach. The market’s appetite for growth and innovation could further fuel this ascent.However, the current price is also in a delicate position, slightly above the second resistance level. This upward trend may invite short-term profit-taking, potentially pushing the price towards the nearest support at $5.09 or even the second support at $2.66 if the market reacts strongly. Long-term, prices are volatile and subject to changes in market sentiment and broader economic conditions. Mantle’s 200.7% Surge: Trend, Resistance & SupportLooking at Mantle’s recent surge of 35.32% over a month and an impressive 200.70% hike in six months, the momentum is strong. With the current price at $1.20, the nearest resistance at $1.08 might soon be a support if the trend continues. Yet, remember, trends can reverse, and if it does, the price could test the $0.63 support, or even drop to $0.37. Be mindful that rapid climbs can lead to sharp declines.The long-term view shows Mantle has grown a lot, but without the all-time high and change, it’s tricky. If it can hold above the 10-day and 100-day averages of $0.96 and $0.76, this could signal stability and ongoing growth. Watch for any move towards the second resistance of $1.27 as a sign of strength. Still, any negative developments could push the price back to these averages or below, testing long-term trust in its value stability.ConclusionIn conclusion, while several assets stand out with notable performances and commendable growth potential, BlastUP comes under the spotlight with its unique position in the Blast ecosystem.

Buy BlastUP Tokens Now and Catapult Your Investments <<Avalanche’s Strong Growth with Investment CautionsAvalanche has surged 38.22% in one month and an impressive 487.32% in six months, showcasing robust growth. Considering the all-time high of $151.22 and the current price at $54.26, there are splendid long-term opportunities if the coin taps into ongoing market trends and innovations, possibly revisiting past peaks. Short-term, Avalanche faces a mix of signals. With RSI and Stochastic indicators suggesting neutrality, there’s room for the price to swing in either direction, hinging on market sentiment. The current SMA 10-days at $55 suggests some selling pressure, while the 100-day SMA at $41.44 is a buying signal. Investors could see dips as chances to buy, but cautiousness is key; the MACD’s sell signal indicates possible upcoming price drops.Impressive 176% Surge in Optimism (OP), Market Eyes ResistanceIn the past six months, Optimism (OP) surged impressively, jumping nearly 176%. This upward movement signals strong market interest, and if this trend continues, the price could look at testing the first resistance level at $4.32, perhaps even aiming for the second at $4.95. Multiple indicators suggest buying, including the MACD and both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Given these signals, enthusiasm might drive prices nearer to the all-time high of around $4.87, especially if the short-term outlook remains bright and traders keep a buy-and-hold stance.However, the one-month change shows a modest increase of just 0.02%, indicating that recent momentum has slowed. This pause can imply that the price may stabilize before making any significant moves. If the market sentiment shifts or if traders lock in profits, it could challenge the nearest support at $2.95 or even push towards the second support at $2.20.  Polkadot’s Growth Indicates Potential for RecoveryPolkadot shows a notable one-month price change at 13.26% and an impressive six-month growth of 131.22%. Considering its all-time high of $56.22 and the current price of $9.48, there’s strong potential for recovery and further growth. Recent trends could attract investors looking for growth opportunities, which may push the price towards the nearest resistance level at $9.26 and beyond.  However, market indicators like the MACD suggest a sell action, which could point to potential short-term downward pressure. If this sentiment prevails, prices might test the nearest support at $6.91 or even the second support at $5.55. Investors might see these levels as opportunities to buy, reflected by the simple moving average recommendations asserting a buy action in both 10-day and 100-day windows. Jupiter’s Market Surge: Analyzing its PotentialJupiter’s recent growth is hard to ignore, with a one month jump of 158.83% and a massive six month surge of 4250.00%. Considering the current price of $1.31, a bullish case could see the price testing the nearest resistance at $0.68, possibly aiming for $0.81. If the momentum continues, the appetite for risk among investors might push the price even higher, attracting more attention to its growth narrative.  Despite the impressive uptick, investors must remember every asset has potential downturns. The nearest support at $0.42 and the second level at $0.30 serve as reminders of where the price might land if the market sentiment shifts. Long-term prospects could be dampened by unforeseen events, leading to a reevaluation of the asset’s value.  ConclusionIn a sea of digital assets each promising a tomorrow brighter than the next, BlastUP stands out with extraordinary potential as part of the innovative Blast ecosystem. With its strong concept and comprehensive Web3 and AI tool suite, BlastUP is poised for significant impact in the blockchain startup sphere. While other coins spotlighted in this article show promise with their respective gains and market indicators, BlastUP seems particularly positioned to spearhead the charge into the future of crypto. Its rapid fundraising success and a clear-cut path to 2026 exemplify why BlastUP could very well lead the pack with the highest potential for growth.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited – Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! <<Avalanche’s Momentum: Short-Term Gains and OutlookSeeing Avalanche has climbed by over 38% in the last month signals strong short-term momentum. It overshooting its nearest resistance suggests high demand, yet we need to watch if it holds above the $46.32 level. Should it stay above the 10-day SMA, the uptrend might persist. But, breaking under could attract selling, pressing it towards the $33.98 support.A 487% surge over six months coupled with a price notably lower than the all-time high presents room for future growth long-term. Steadily exceeding the 100-day SMA indicates building strength. However, significant increases can attract profit-taking, potentially pulling the price back. Still, if buying persists, it may test the second resistance level, hinting at a longer-term uptrend.Polkadot’s Growth: Balancing Potential and RisksPolkadot shows a significant one-month gain of 13.38% and an impressive six-month increase of 131.46%. With the current price at $9.49, just above the nearest resistance of $9.26, the momentum could push prices towards the second resistance level at $10.25. Considering the historical peak at $56.22, current levels suggest room for growth. The moving averages signal a buying opportunity, indicating a potential upswing if the market sentiment remains positive.However, the mixed signals from technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that selling could be prudent, pointing to possible short-term declines. The current price hovers near the 10-day simple moving average of $9.38, signaling stability, yet the nearest support level at $6.91 stresses the importance of market resilience. Long-term, the 100-day simple moving average at $8.21 supports an uptrend, but if breached, it could lead to a test of the second support at $5.55, revealing the need for cautious optimism.Optimism Price Steady, Potential for GrowthOptimism’s current price of $3.72, closely aligned with its 10-day simple moving average of $3.64, suggests a stable short-term trend, which could entice buyers. Its recent one-month minor increase of 0.34% indicates a potential for slow yet steady growth in the coming weeks. The coin’s resistance at $4.32 may cap near-term gains, but breaching this could signal stronger buyer confidence, pushing towards the $4.95 level. However, short-term traders should be cautious, as a drop below the nearest support at $2.95 could lead to further declines towards $2.20, though current indicators lean towards buying.Considering Optimism’s remarkable six-month surge of 176.73%, long-term prospects seem bright. This performance, paired with a solid support above $2.00, offers a cushion against significant downturns, suggesting a resilient market sentiment. With its all-time high at $4.87 within sight, a bullish outlook is supported, especially if the 100-day simple moving average at $3.61 continues to trend upwards. Long-term risks include the coin failing to uphold momentum, which might result in a pull-back below the key support levels.  Jupiter’s Price Surges Amid Market OptimismWith Jupiter’s price up by 158.67% in the past month and an incredible 4247.33% over six months, we’re seeing strong short-term growth. Its current price is $1.30, just above the 10-day average of $1.29, suggesting consistent demand. If it can break through the nearest resistance at $0.677 and aim for $0.807, this momentum could continue for some time.Longer-term, the substantial increase in value requires caution. If a pullback occurs, the levels at $0.424 and $0.300 could provide safety nets, but the market can be unpredictable. Balancing the rapid recent increases with the potential for future corrections is key, and watching the support and resistance levels will be crucial in navigating Jupiter’s price journey.ConclusionIn conclusion, while other emerging altcoins like Avalanche, Polkadot, Optimism, and Jupiter show signs of promise and potential growth, BlastUP stands out with the most compelling upside. The project’s integration into the wider Blast ecosystem, innovative use of AI and Web3 tools, and its strong community-driven approach position it as a particularly attractive investment. With its presale grabbing the attention of discerning investors, BlastUP is poised to capitalize on the current market and could soar to impressive heights, marking it as the altcoin with the highest potential as we look ahead.Site: https://blastup.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_ioDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVWTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Pushes 'Positive-Sum' Vision for Meme Coins - Decrypt

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a "positive-sum" vision for meme coins, arguing that the current crop of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies do little more than "go up and down in price and contribute nothing of value in their wake."In a recent blog post, Buterin argued that "many people feel uneasy" about the current crop of meme coins, and outlined how the "financialized games" that underpin them can be made to support public goods and charities.He took aim at a recent wave of "openly super-racist" meme coins on blockchains such as Solana, adding that, "I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1."Buterin seemed to be referring to a rash of blatantly racist tokens that appeared on exchanges last week, many that used the n-word, a token called "Jews did 9/11," and "NAZI," which appears on exchanges with a swastika as its trading symbol."One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity," Buterin said. A more productive step, he argued, is to create a "more positive-sum version" of the whole concept of meme coins.Buterin envisions meme coins being more like GiveWell Inu (which is no longer active), which promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to the Give Well organization.Back in 2021, after Buterin had been gifted half the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply he swapped them for Ethereum. After he'd done that, he sent $53 million worth of the ETH to Give Well. But the project seems to no longer be maintained.Anticipating that his ideas might steal the fun of degens who enjoy taking a gamble on new meme coins, he suggested that developers build better Web3 games. He specifically put the spotlight on the 0xPARC organization, which has been responsible for games Dark Forest and FrogCrypto."I value people's desire to have fun," Buterin said, adding that, "I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it."Edited by Stephen Graves.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Short squeeze alert for next week: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket


The cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation range after a remarkable bull rally, followed by a bearish correction. Meanwhile, the latter has favored an increased open interest in short positions for some cryptocurrencies that could short squeeze.
Essentially, a short squeeze happens when a sudden price increase forces multiple opened shorts to close, liquidating the bearish traders. This event fuels the uptrend, driving prices even further.
Therefore, identifying large liquidity pools to the upside could help cryptocurrency traders spot valuable opportunities in the derivatives market.


Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on March 29 and spotted a short-squeeze potential for Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX).
Solana (SOL)
First, Solana’s open interest has maintained historical highs in the past few weeks, following its native token’s, SOL, price action. There are currently over $3 billion in Futures contracts while traders speculate on SOL’s volatility.

Interestingly, much of this interest is allocated to short positions, which has created large liquidity pools to the upside. In particular, with meaningful accumulation at $192, $194, and $197, making those potential targets in a short squeeze next week.
As of writing, SOL trades at around $185 and a run to these targets offers a possible 6.5% gain.

Avalanche (AVAX)
One of Solana’s most promising competitors, Avalanche, is also presenting a potential short-squeeze opportunity for next week. However, AVAX’s open interest is lower than $500 million, with a significantly lower capital flow than its leading competitor.

Like SOL, the majority of the market’s interest in Avalanche seems to weigh towards short positions. In particular, creating a massive liquidation target at the $59.5 price level, with over 11.5% potential gains from $53.35 registered at the time of publication.

Despite the relevant potential, short-sellers futures liquidations do not guarantee a short squeeze will occur. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and drastically changes every minute with news and technical analyses.

                        The crypto exchange HKVAEX, linked to the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has withdrawn its virtual asset trading platform license application from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) post-deadline.The Hong Kong securities regulator asked crypto exchanges and firms to apply for the license before the deadline of February 29.HKVAEX Withdraws Application for Virtual Asset Trading Platform License in Hong Kong
The Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) is a license provided by the government of Hong Kong that allows crypto exchanges to operate within the region’s bounds.Although the license has been available for several years now, only two exchanges—HashKey and OSL—currently possess one. HashKey secured its approval in November 2022, with its competitor getting the nod a month later in December 2022. Several applicants have been on the waitlist for a while, including HKVAEX, linked with Binance, until yesterday, when the firm withdrew its application.
Source: sfc.hk
HKVAEX, which reportedly shares technical and other resources with Binance, according to Chinese state media SCMP, submitted its application on January 4. However, the exchange appears to be missing from the list of companies whose license applications are on Hong Kong’s SFC website, which confirms that HKVAEX withdrew its license application nearly three months after the filing. Notably, the SFC publicly maintains a list of crypto platforms that will receive operational licenses to raise public awareness of safe crypto trading.The reasons behind the withdrawal are unclear. Some believe it may be due to a request to change the audit company, insufficient materials, or other reasons. The Hong Kong SFC stipulates that crypto trading platforms apply for regional operational licenses by February 29, also setting a May 31 deadline for non-compliant exchanges to cease operations. Consequently, HKVAEX must close their businesses in Hong Kong by May 31.In addition to HKVAEX, three other virtual asset trading platforms withdrew their license applications in 2024, although the reasons remain undisclosed. This includes Huobi, a prominent global crypto exchange.HTX (Formerly Huobi) Resubmits License Application in Hong Kong After Initial Withdrawal
In February, HTX, formerly known as Huobi, withdrew its license application in Hong Kong and then resubmitted it. HTX initially submitted the exchange license application in early February, only to withdraw three days later on February 23, citing the Securities and Futures Commission’s list of license applicants. The company, however, resubmitted the application on February 27, according to the SFC’s website.Unlike its neighbouring Chinese mainland’s broader crypto trading and mining crackdown, Hong Kong rolled out the welcome mat for crypto firms last year. In June 2023, Hong Kong officially started its crypto licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms, allowing licensed exchanges to offer retail trading services. Many global exchanges have applied for the retail trading licenses.According to its website, the financial regulator is officially reviewing applications from 19 crypto firms, including OKX, Bybit, Bullish, and Crypto.com. The SFC urged investors to verify trading platforms using its public register of licensed persons and registered institutions and the list of licensed virtual asset trading platforms for relevant information on licensed entities, including their official websites.

Dogwifhat flips Pepe as WIF hits new ATH - CoinJournal



                    

                    Dogwifhat (WIF) strengthened its position as the top Solana-based meme coin. 
With a 20% spike on Friday, the popular meme coin hit $4 to reach a new all-time high. This came after WIF price pushed past the previous all-time high reached in mid-March.
Chart showing dogwifhat price. Source: TradingView
The gains saw dogwifhat flip Pepe in market cap after it reached $4 billion. Pepe, which had weekly gains of just 6% compared to WIF’s 64%, had its market cap at around $3.3 billion at the time of writing.
At current prices of $3.63, WIF is way up on its all-time low of $0.001555 in mid-December 2023.
Dogecoin breaks above $0.2
Dogwifhat’s recent surge has it poised behind meme coin heavyweights Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. 
DOGE has had a decent run of its own, with Dogecoin price hitting highs of $0.22. The original dog-meme coin has jumped more than 120% in the past 30 days.
This upside has come as bets on DOGE futures rose to a record $2.2 billion amid bullish sentiment around potential listing of Dogecoin futures trading on Coinbase.
The exchange recently revealed it would launch futures trading for Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

Crypto Expert Publishes A Run-Down Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lesser Known Activities | Bitcoinist.com


								Coinbase’s Director of Product Strategy & Business Operations and On-chain Sleuth Conor Grogan recently highlighted some of Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) lesser-known activities. These were primarily on-chain transactions that the FTX founder carried out, but they were never brought to light during his trial. 
How Sam Bankman-Fried On-Chain Transactions Harmed Crypto
Grogan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bankman-Fried, through Alameda Research, sold $75 million of staked ETH (stETH) in January 2022. This led to a massive depeg event, which triggered the bank run on bankrupt crypto lender Celsius. That was also the tail event that brought about the collapse of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).

Bankman-Fried is also said to have used FTX customer funds to purchase a bunch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that didn’t necessarily have any utility, including CarolineDAO NFTs. CarolineDAO proudly claimed to be “SimpDAO for Caroline Ellison,” the former CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend.   
Grogan further revealed that Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research engaged in thousands of wash-trading transactions to boost the visibility of SBF’s holdings. Wash trading is a form of market manipulation in which the same trader buys and sells an asset to give the impression that there is demand for it. 
Alameda, being a market maker and with FTX customers’ funds at its disposal, had enough capital to manipulate the market. At some point, the trading firm was said to have had more trading activity than MEV bots. 
Another way Sam Bankman-Fried tried to play the market was when the FTX founder’s ‘test’ NFT was created and sold for $270,000, with Grogan speculating that it was most likely bought by SBF himself using customers’ funds. Bankman-Fried was also at it again when he received 2 million RAY tokens and proceeded to sell part of them, even though they were meant to be vested. 
More On Bankman-Fried’s On-Chain Activity
Shiba Inu (SHIB) was also caught in the mix as Bankman-Fried is said to have helped the token’s price skyrocket while building a large position. He eventually offloaded his SHIB tokens, which caused the meme coin to plummet. Interestingly, this happened when FTX had just expanded its SHIB perpetual, meaning SBF possibly shorted the meme coin, too. 

SHIB wasn’t the only crypto token that Sam Bankman-Fried aggressively dumped. Grogan revealed that the FTX founder offloaded 35,000 SUSHI tokens while lying about not having dumped or shortened the coin. 
The FTT token he “invented” also played a massive role in his on-chain transactions as he wrapped and rewrapped the exchange’s utility token to gain more liquidity. That explains why Sam Bankman-Fried, almost every week, publicly shilled FTT and pretended to TWAP the token. 
Grogan also mentioned that Bankman-Fried wasn’t active on-chain until the crimes started. Alameda wallets, in particular, weren’t very active until FTX’s Director of Engineering Nishad Singh created the bug, which enabled the trading firm to withdraw unlimited sums from FTX’s account.

Bitcoin bulls await $15 billion options expiry: Is $80K inevitable?


With the arrival of the deadline for the cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit to settle its $15 billion contracts in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin bulls in particular have a strong reason to rejoice, as early as this weekend or next week, with a possible $80,000 waiting around the corner.
Specifically, Bitcoin is still trading above its 2021 all-time high (ATH), with the possibility of a breakout this weekend or next week, against the backdrop of the expected expiration of $15 billion in digital assets, as the crypto analyst CryptoJelleNL noted in an X post on March 29.
Bitcoin price prediction
On top of that, the pseudonymous crypto trading expert has shared the BTC price prediction that sees the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset hitting the target at $80,000 in “a matter of time,” as it has recently broken out of its descending broadening wedge and above its weekly support.

Earlier, this crypto expert also highlighted that Bitcoin was breaking out of its cup & handle chart pattern, a movement that typically happens after an uptrend and suggests that the market is preparing “for a new move higher,” which in Bitcoin’s case is a “target of roughly $80,000.”

Meanwhile, the maiden crypto asset was at press time changing hands at a price of $70,140, recording a decline of 0.86% on the day but nonetheless increasing 9.19% across the past week, and adding up to the more significant 18.08% gain in the last month, according to the latest charts on March 29.

It is also important to mention that Bitcoin might be looking at even more impressive gains in this cycle, at least where crypto specialist TradingShot is concerned, deriving a BTC price prediction target at $200,o00 on the basis of the asset’s remarkable resistance and previous patterns, as Finbold reported on March 28.
All things considered, things are looking great for the future price of Bitcoin, but the cryptoverse can sometimes be a volatile place, and making a definitive Bitcoin price prediction is a difficult task, so doing one’s own research is critical when investing.

The blockchain-based mini-decentralized applications (DApps) on Telegram, also known as Mini Apps, could be a “Trojan horse” for mass blockchain adoption.That’s according to Justin Hyun, the director of investments at TON Foundation, who told Cointelegraph:“That’s our thesis for bringing in more users onto the blockchain without even needing to educate them about the blockchain. It’s a Trojan horse way to say: look, you’re letting in all these user-friendly DApps, and we won’t even necessarily call them DApps [...] It’s just Telegram Mini Apps that they’re using whether that’s inside their channels.”Telegram Mini Apps launched in 2020 as an open platform allowing Web3 businesses to deploy crypto-friendly apps directly within the Telegram messaging app. They were launched in partnership with The Open Network (TON) Foundation and Tencent with the intention of creating a super-app platform.Bringing the next 500 million users on-chain will require simple initial use cases where users aren’t necessarily aware of the underlying blockchain interaction. Hyun says:“We believe mass adoption really comes in the form of simple use cases in the beginning, and then there will be drop-offs of more sophisticated users going into different types of use cases. But bringing 500 million people on-chain by 2028 — which is our goal — is going to require use cases that interact with the blockchain without the user knowing that in the front end.”Some Telegram Mini Apps will also offer Web3-specific financial incentives for users, Hyun explained.VIDEOJustin Hyun talks about the mechanics of Mini Apps.

Acura Capital and $100M Patex Unite to Launch a New Digital Bank



                    
Acura Capital, a distinguished investment fund from Brazil with assets under management worth $1.8 billion and $3 billion in assets in custody, is launching an innovative financial product. The idea comes from a collaboration with Patex, Latin America’s leading developer of blockchain ecosystems. By joining their efforts, Acura Capital and Patex aim to debut a digital banking platform designed to transform the financial sector.



Services That Will Revolutionize the Latin America Banking Sector



A new digital banking platform is set to revolutionize the Latin American market. This innovative platform harmonizes the trusted reliability of traditional banking services with cutting-edge advancements in cryptocurrency technology. Acura Capital and Patex’s collaboration is poised to bridge the region’s unique economic gaps, leveraging Acura Capital’s extensive financial expertise and Patex’s profound insights in the blockchain sector.




The jointly developed product will serve over 670 million people living in Latin America. Uniting banking solutions with blockchain technologies, the project will offer the following solutions:




Digital wallet. This wallet is fortified with cutting-edge encryption methods, ensuring the secure storage and management of user assets. Its user-friendly interface facilitates swift financial transactions across a diverse array of currencies. This is a reliable option for users to work with funds and store them in one place, providing peace of mind.



Exchange platform. It is where users may convert different currencies – fiat and crypto – seamlessly and swiftly. The exchange platform offers low conversion rates and allows for the implementation of efficient trading strategies.



Tokens for payments. Patex tokens can now be used in transactions on the Pix platform. It is a popular instant payment platform released by the Central Bank of Brazil. Patex tokens serve to facilitate efficient transactions on Pix without having to deal with traditional financial go-betweens.



Crypto cards. These cards are built to function similarly to regular cards, allowing for a wide range of transactions, such as in-store purchases and online subscriptions. For users’ convenience, they can also be easily linked with popular digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay.



Instant money transfer. This new feature is changing the game when it comes to financial transactions. It allows users to send and receive funds instantly, around the clock. It means that the long waiting periods associated with traditional bank transfers are a thing of the past, and banking efficiency has reached a whole new level of convenience.



RWA tokenization. Patex integrates tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) into the $6 trillion economy of Latin America. It carries out the transformation of physical assets into tradable securities listed on traditional exchanges. These securities form the basis for creating tokenized assets, which will be issued through security token offerings and subsequently traded on secondary markets.



Floating services are designed to adapt to changing market conditions. They do this by dynamically adjusting the interest rates on savings and loans to provide customers with the most favorable conditions.



Personal loans are tailored to meet the needs of its customers, offering flexible repayment plans, competitive interest rates, and a straightforward application process. The platform prioritizes fast approvals and minimal documentation requirements, ensuring a hassle-free experience for its clients.

Wealth management. The digital banking solution uses analytical tools and market data to provide personalized financial assistance in investment management for every client based on their plans and readiness to risk.




Fernando Luiz de Senna Figueiredo, Managing Director of Acura Capital, claimed the partnership with Patex would push the boundaries of what is possible with technology today: 



“By combining our respective strengths, we’re creating a digital banking platform that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. Our teams also deeply understand how to cater to the needs of Latin American users,” he said.

Got $500? Buy these cryptos


March has been an exciting month for cryptocurrencies, with a rally that led to a new Bitcoin (BTC)  all-time high near $73,000 and then a correction that saw a significant crash across the board.
As the month is drawing to a close – and the month of the highly-anticipated BTC halving is drawing ever nearer – the crypto market is again eying a rise in value, especially given few of the big coins and tokens in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red on both the daily and weekly charts.
Since there is likely to be much excitement in the coming weeks – and likely several major surges – Finbold decided to take a look at a couple of cryptocurrencies that may well be worth investing $500 or more in April.


Polkadot (DOT)
While Polkadot (DOT) has remained relatively under the radar in 2024, the cryptocurrency has actually offered multiple exciting developments that are either already live or are actively in the works.
For one, the Polkadot network logged a new non-fungible token (NFT) minting speed record through its parachain – Unique Network – having reached nearly 5,000 NFTs per minute.
Additionally, a dedicated team is actively working on a new meme coin – DED – which has already gained significant traction within the community and might not only provide a boost for DOT itself but could also constitute the latest such project to explode once released.
Finally, Polkadot appears to be readying itself for its next big rally based on its recent performance as it has recently started breaking out of a correction it entered following the previous surge.
The last 30 days saw DOT trade with significant volatility but remain 12.70% in the green while the token is 9.06% up on the weekly chart. Polkadot price today has also changed in a positive direction as it climbed 1.25% to $9.64.

DOT’s relative quietness during the ongoing rally and the fact that is still well below its all-time highs near $53 also make it a good candidate for a continued surge – particularly with the recent string of developments in mind.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
The oldest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) also appears like a strong buy at April’s doorstep. Not only has the month historically been at least somewhat kind to the cryptocurrency type, but there has been a growing interest in the coin.
Indeed, in the last two weeks, whales accumulated approximately $280 million worth of DOGE helping its market cap surge approximately $7 billion in the time frame and creating new higher support zones with a likely continued Bitcoin rally nearly guaranteeing a continuous Dogecoin surge.
On the price side, Dogecoin has also been doing well in recent times and is up 140.03% since the start of 2024. Most recently, it has been on a rampage breaking above $0.2 and retesting the resistance at $0.22.

The uptrend has been particularly strong in the last 30 days of trading which saw the meme coin surge 66.34% and the most recent time frames have also been generally strong with DOGE climbing 45.15% in the last 7 days to $0.216 – highest it has been since November 2021.

Another Approval for Bitcoin from Brazil! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin continues to reach wider audiences after the spot BTC ETFs approved by the SEC in January, another approval came from Brazil.
Brazil's popular cryptocurrency exchange B3 announced that the country's securities regulator has given permission to offer Bitcoin futures to its customers, Reuters reports.


Accordingly, the exchange will start Bitcoin futures trading on April 17. The exchange said that the BTC futures contract allows transactions without the need to buy or sell actual Bitcoin.
Accordingly, Bitcoin futures will be pegged to the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price, and each contract will represent 10% of Bitcoin's BTC value priced in Brazilian reals.





Speaking to Reuters, B3 senior executive said the following about the new Bitcoin development:

“The launch meets demand for a derivative that provides a hedge against Bitcoin price fluctuations or directional risk to the asset.”

With the latest BTC decision, Brazil continues to be one of the countries that attract attention with its positive attitude towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Will Hit $150,000 By 2025, According To Investment Firm CEO's Crypto Crystal Ball


								With the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving just weeks away, industry pundit Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, is fueling the fire of investor excitement with a daring price prediction: Bitcoin reaching a staggering $150,000 by 2025.

Will Bitcoin Register A New ATH?
Yusko’s bullish outlook hinges on a combination of factors. He cites Metcalfe’s law, a network effect model, to estimate the top crypto’s current “fair value” at $50,000.
The upcoming halving, which cuts miner rewards in half, is expected to disrupt supply dynamics and historically has been followed by price surges. However, Yusko acknowledges the emergence of transaction fees as a new wrinkle, potentially mitigating the immediate impact of the halving on miner profitability.
VIDEO
This cycle might be a bit different, Yusko says, referring to the transaction fees generated by Ordinals and Inscriptions, a recent development allowing users to embed data onto the Bitcoin blockchain.
Bitcoin’s ‘Fair Value’
Despite this, he anticipates a fair value of $75,000 post-halving due to factors like increased investor interest and the “fear of missing out” (FOMO) that often accompanies such events.
Yusko isn’t alone in his optimism. Big names like Robert Kiyosaki and Standard Chartered bank share his belief in a potential $150,000 price target. This sentiment echoes the broader bullish trend in the crypto market, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation.

BTCUSD trading at $70,227 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
But not everyone is convinced. Bitcoin’s price history is notoriously volatile, and external factors like regulatory changes or economic downturns can quickly derail even the most well-reasoned predictions. Critics also point out limitations in applying Metcalfe’s law, originally designed for communication networks, to a complex system like Bitcoin.

Exact Price Trajectory Unclear
The road to $150,000 also remains unclear. While Yusko predicts a significant price increase after the halving, with a potential peak around nine months later (end of 2024), the exact trajectory hinges on a delicate balance between supply and demand.
Increased demand from institutional investors, particularly through vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs, could propel the price upwards. However, this needs to be met by a constrained supply due to the halving.
The price has to rise with more demand than supply, the analyst emphasizes, suggesting a potentially parabolic price movement towards the end of the year. Historically, Bitcoin price peaks have occurred around nine months after halving events, before a subsequent bear market sets in.

Three Weeks Left till Bitcoin Halving 2024, Big Boost for Bitcoin ETF | Coinspeaker



Historically, past Bitcoin halving events have proved to be bullish for the Bitcoin price, with analysts expecting a rally to $200,000. 

The much-awaited Bitcoin halving 2024 is exactly three weeks or 21 days away from here scheduled to happen on April 19, depending on the block time average of the last 20,160 blocks. The next Bitcoin halving shall occur at block 840,000. However, some market analysts also believe that the exact date of halving might vary by a day more at around April 20.
The Bitcoin halving cycle represents a programmed reduction in BTC rewards. This reduction involves the halving of the mining rewards awarded to Bitcoin miners approximately every four years, which occur at every 210,000 blocks. In the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the miner rewards will reduce from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.




Several Bitcoin miners have already begun preparations to set the next course of action after halving. Most of the Bitcoin miners have been liquidating their holdings in the past few months and using the proceeds to upgrade their mining equipment.
Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been considered good for BTC investors as the supply reduction drives prices higher in the long term. Thus, many are expecting history to repeat once again with some giving Bitcoin price targets of $200,000 by 2025 end.
Bitcoin Halving 2024 Potentially Boosts ETF Momentum
Popular broker Canaccord Genuity recently released a report talking about Bitcoin’s remarkable 60% surge in the first quarter. The broker noted that this rally came primarily on the backdrop of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launch, the impending reward halving, and a growing appetite for risk in financial markets.
The analysts, led by Michael Graham, highlighted that while the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, the forthcoming halving event could further bolster the tailwinds for Bitcoin ETFs. They further emphasized that activity levels across the cryptocurrency ecosystem have been rebounding from the lows seen in 2023.
As said, the fourth halving event, which slashes miner rewards by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of Bitcoin, is anticipated in April. Canaccord expressed optimism about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in the quarter, foreseeing a sustained tailwind as retail investors seek to incorporate crypto exposure into tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs.
Furthermore, the report states that publicly traded Bitcoin miners underperformed BTC during the first quarter. This clearly highlights their decoupling from the BTC price. As a result, many are also questioning the profitability of the miners after the upcoming halving.
On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs provide equity investors an alternative to seek exposure to Bitcoin. Canaccord suggested that if historical patterns repeat, a potentially more bullish period for Bitcoin could unfold in the months following the halving event.

AI and crypto worlds merge to become ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’

What if artificial intelligence combines with cryptocurrency? The answer would be perhaps the future of everything. Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?One such merger actually happened earlier this week, when blockchain networks Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol combined their tokens into one and created an alliance for decentralized AI — or “ASI,” which stands for “artificial superintelligence.”Their partnership aims to provide an alternative to tech giants’ growing control of the AI industry.Here’s what to know.What’s the purpose of the alliance?All three blockchain networks will continue to operate as before, but the new agreement will enable the platforms to collaborate to create blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which cannot be controlled by large stakeholders or centralized parties. The goal is to provide a viable alternative to tech giants’ control over AI development, usage, and monetization.Read more: Big Tech is swallowing up AIFetch.AI is a blockchain network that provides tools to build innovative AI apps and services. Its native token is FET. Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based marketplace that acts as a bridge between data providers and data consumers, and its native token is OCEAN. SingularityNET, on the other hand, offers a blockchain-based AI marketplace, and its native token is AGIX.Tokens jumped almost 30% in a weekAccording to crypto tracking site CoinGecko, Fetch.ai’s FET token has a market cap of $3.3 billion. Following that are SingularityNet’s AGIX token, with a market cap of $1.7 billion, and Ocean Protocol’s (OCEAN) token, with a market cap of $856 million. The merger will bring the new token ASI to a fully diluted valuation of $7.5 billion.Over the past seven days, FET shares rose 28%, AGIX shares soared 31%, and OCEAN shares jumped 28%.From chip to blockchain, AI is everywhereIn the past few years, artificial intelligence has gained widespread acceptance across all sectors of technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple — everyone is betting on AI. As blockchain companies strive to make data more decentralized and transparent, it’s no wonder they want to join the AI space.

Markus Thielen Forecasts Bitcoin (BTC) to Surge 12% in April | Coinspeaker



While historical data and current market sentiments suggest that BTC will likely rally after the halving event, other analysts have cautioned inventors against relying on past performance to forecast future price movements.

As March gradually comes to a close, Markus Thielen, a senior analyst at 10x Research, has shared his insights on potential Bitcoin behavior for the upcoming month.
According to a recent social media post on X, the top crypto analyst said that Bitcoin (BTC) has had a massive rally of seven consecutive months and could continue in the trajectory to rally 12% from the current price of $70,000 to $84,000 in April.




Bitcoin’s Historical April Performance
Thielen noted that April could be a particularly favorable month for BTC, especially with the industry anticipating Bitcoin halving 2024 to occur within the month.
Referencing historical patterns, the analyst said that the month April has the tendency to deliver positive returns for Bitcoin, with six out of the last ten years experiencing significant price increases.


This historical data aligns with BTC past performance after previous halving events. For example, the crypto asset jumped over 30% in the first few months that followed 2020 halving before recording an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in 2021.
Thielen suggested that BTC could follow the same pattern of previous performance to soar 12% come next month. The analyst predicted that with this historical pattern, the upcoming halving could be a significant catalyst for another bullish rally, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs.
Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest
In addition to the historical data, market sentiment also seems to be another factor that could potentially drive the rally, with several indicators pointing towards a positive outlook for BTC.
The recent introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, bringing an influx of institutional investors into the industry, has added legitimacy to the crypto asset as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
Industry executives like Matthew Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer said in a recent memo distributed to industry professionals that investors could potentially invest as much as $1 trillion into BTC through ETFs as they start to enter the crypto market.
Apart from the ETFs, financial companies are also entering the market. Banks such as HSBC are also entering the crypto market, bringing a range of real-world assets (RWA) onto blockchains. The financial institution recently launched its tokenized gold token dubbed HSBC Gold Token for retail investors.
Additionally, the growing interest in Bitcoin futures and options markets indicates that institutional investors are increasingly looking to hedge their positions and take advantage of potential price movements.
While historical data and current market sentiments suggest that BTC will likely rally after the halving event, other analysts have cautioned inventors against relying on past performance to forecast future price movements.

Despite Warren Buffett's Warnings Calling Bitcoin 'Rat Poison,' Berkshire Hathaway Continues Profiting Off Crypto - Benzinga

Though many of the top asset managers and investors are investing in, or at least open to crypto and Bitcoin, a few remain hesitant to adopt the asset. Most prominent among the anti-Bitcoin camp is legendary investor Warren Buffett. Buffett's strategy of investing in solid companies that continuously generate cash and value has been hugely successful. This has allowed his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to sustain itself through market peaks and troughs. Don't Miss:Buffett is notorious for his anti-Bitcoin stance, saying in a 2018 interview with Yahoo! Finance, "If you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more." At the 2022 Berkshire shareholders meeting, Buffett explained his stance on Bitcoin saying, "If you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it? I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn’t going to do anything." Buffett is against Bitcoin and crypto in general. However, this stance does not entirely translate into his company's investments. Berkshire Hathaway is heavily invested in Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings Ltd. The investment was its strongest performer in 2023.Founded in 2013, Nu initially offered low-cost bank accounts and personal loans through a format that was much more digitized than its competitors. In 2022, the company launched Nucripto, which allows users to buy and sell more than 15 tokens. While its crypto business makes up a somewhat small portion of its revenue, it still operates in the crypto sphere, and its customer base continues to grow. It also launched its own cryptocurrency called Nucoin. Buffett had invested $500 million in Nu Holdings through a series G funding round before the company went public in December 2021. A few months later, Buffett increased his stake by another $250 million, resulting in a total investment of $750 million. The investment has paid off. Nu is up nearly 50% in 2024 alone and recently set all-time highs. This is also coming off a strong 2023, in which the stock was up nearly 100%. These huge gains could shift Buffett's focus toward crypto. Seeing the profits earned on a crypto-related business could cause the investor to rethink his strategy and stance on crypto. Bitcoin has outperformed most major indices so far in 2024. The token is up nearly 70% in 2024, well above the S&P 500, which is up just over 10% in 2024. With Bitcoin and crypto entering the spotlight again, lots of eyes are on Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett as they contemplate whether to continue investing in Bitcoin-adjacent businesses or even the tokens themselvesRead Next:

PCE Price Index Up 0.3% in Feb, in Line with Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.3 percent increase in personal income for February, amounting to a $66.5 billion rise from the previous month. Disposable personal income (DPI) also saw a 0.2 percent increase, equating to a $50.3 billion uptick.



The primary drivers of the personal income growth were increases in compensation and personal current transfer receipts, which were partially offset by a decrease in personal income receipts on assets.



Personal Consumption Expenditures Increase 0.8% in February



Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) increased by 0.8 percent in February, to $145.5 billion, up from the previous month. The service sector accounted for a substantial portion of this growth, with spending increasing by $111.8 billion.



Financial services, insurance, transportation services, housing, and utilities were the primary contributors to this increase. Goods spending also saw a notable rise of $33.7 billion, primarily driven by increased spending on motor vehicles and parts.



Personal outlays, encompassing PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments, grew by $149.9 billion in February. Despite this increase in spending, personal savings remained at $745.7 billion, with a personal saving rate of 3.6 percent





PCE Price Index Up 0.3% in February



The PCE price index, a measure of inflation, rose by 0.3 percent from the previous month, with goods prices increasing by 0.5 percent and services prices by 0.3 percent. The PCE price index still showed a 0.3 percent increase when excluding food and energy.



Real PCE, which adjusts for inflation, grew by 0.4 percent in February. This growth was primarily driven by a 0.6 percent increase in spending on services, with international travel, transportation services, and financial services and insurance being the main contributors.



Spending on goods saw a more modest 0.1 percent increase, largely due to increased spending on motor vehicles and parts. 







How do you think the Fed will see the latest PCE data? Let us know in the comments below.

Crypto Sensation WIF Flips PEPE to Become the Third-Biggest Meme Coin: Details


																TL;DR

WIF hits a new ATH, while other meme coins such as DOGE and SHIB are also well in the green.
Despite the impressive gains, investors are cautioned to be careful when dealing with assets of that type due to their infamous volatility.


The trending Solana-based meme coin – dogwifhat (WIF) – seems to have no limitations, charting a new all-time high price of $4 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization touched a whooping level of $4 billion.
WIF Price, Source: CoinGecko
WIF’s market cap currently stands at approximately $3.7 billion, making it the 40th-biggest cryptocurrency and the third-largest in the meme coin realm. Pepe Coin (PEPE) dropped to the fourth position with a capitalization of around $3.3 billion. 
WIF’s latest resurgence coincides with a significant revival of the meme coin niche. The leading asset of that type – Dogecoin (DOGE) – exceeded the $0.20 mark, witnessing gains of 32% on a weekly scale. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also well in the green, albeit in a more modest fashion.




It is safe to say that WIF’s success is more than impressive considering the fact that it entered the market at the end of last year. Its price is up over 2,000% since the beginning of 2024 and the rally caught the eye of some prominent industry participants.
One example is Arthur Hayes – BitMEX’s co-founder – who posted a photo of himself wearing a hat (referring to the token’s name and logo). Here recently said “the hat stays on while I count to $10.”
Another factor possibly contributing to WIF’s price increase is the support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, BitMEX, Coinbase, and Kraken are some of those that enabled trading services with the asset.
Dogwifhat’s upswing has been more than welcomed by savvy traders who hopped on the bandwagon in its early days. As CryptoPotato reported, one particular investor bought more than 2.5 million tokens at the end of 2023, spending just $310. Currently, the stash is worth over $9 million.
On the other hand, traders should be aware that dealing with meme coins could also lead to crucial losses due to the infamous volatility of the asset class. Those about to enter the ecosystem should check our video below to avoid some common mistakes:

Meme coin market cap soared over 100% in one month: IntoTheBlock - Crypto Briefing




The meme coin sector has seen renewed speculative interest amid the ongoing crypto bull market, with the total market cap recently exceeding $50 billion, according to IntoTheBlock’s latest newsletter. This is a new cycle peakNew tokens like Jeo Boden and Dogwifhat have quickly risen in popularity, while 2020 darlings like SHIB and DOGE see resurgent trading activity.Jeo Boden rise peaked at almost 1,500% since its inception on Mar. 9, fueled by the hype around meme coins titled with notorious figures names spelled wrong. A similar movement was registered by tokens following the same pattern, like Doland Tremp, as its price peak was close to 550% in the same period.However, when it comes to gains, Dogwifhat (WIF) is in another league. Created in last year’s December, WIF was quick to catch the crypto community’s attention, rising over 237,000% when it reached its all-time high.Year-on-year of meme coins market cap. Image: IntoTheBlockBlockchains with lower fees, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Base, are attracting most of the meme coin trades. Consequently, those are the networks where the tokens with the highest potential returns are created.SHIB, one of the popular dog-themed meme coins from the past bull cycle, is also showing positive signs. IntoTheBlock’s data shows that 66% of SHIB addresses are now in profit, the highest level since its November 2021 all-time high.Yet, the newsletter highlights that the meme coin market cap relies on the Bitcoin (BTC) price movements since a potential BTC downturn might negatively affect this sector.

Bitcoin halving spurs accelerated installations

The global installation of Bitcoin ATMs is experiencing a notable surge following the Bitcoin halving, as predicted by the CEO of a major Bitcoin ATM operator. Brandon Mintz, CEO of Bitcoin Depot, anticipates a global acceleration in installations, attributing this trend to the typical surge in crypto FOMO (fear of missing out) accompanying the Bitcoin halving period.Topping off the roll, in 2023, the first occurrence of an annual fall off in crypto-currency ATM installations set in during almost a decade, primarily ascribed to a bear wave proclaimed as a result of crypto company failures. But there was a complete flipside in 2024; in the 1st three months of installed crypto ATMs 1,469, 3,000 number of removed were in 2023 by that same time.Industry rebound predictedBrandon Mintz expects a wider ATM industry to witness a comeback in Bitcoin’s rebirth while soaring past its previous price height of $20,000 in this March. It is underscored that the past bull markets have had a particular pattern of growing cryptocurrency, first with the users who follow the movement in order to avoid all the hassle and then during the FOMO phase which is characterized by a surge in visitors and consequently in the use of Bitcoin ATMs.Despite the recent increase in ATM installations, Mintz highlights a concerning trend: an ATM operator termination rate dropped by almost 30% during the last six months. The failure of a major player (Coin Cloud with 5000 ATMs) in February 2023 showed the troubles lying heavy on the industry and made them worse due to the fluctuation of market value and the blockage of crypto exchanges.Bitcoin Depot’s growth trajectoryBitcoin Depot announced its performance for the fourth quarter and a full year in 2023. It was disclosed that the company’s revenues increased by 7% compared to 2022 to reach $689 million. Regarding the net income, it decreased from the 2022 level by 54% and totaled $1.6 million. As of Q1 of 2024, the business has hit 900 ATM installations in 24 U.S. states, most of which are convenience stores. The plan is to acquire close to 940 next.Data gathered by CoinATMRadar reveals that Bitcoin Depot has been together with a few operators in this market. With second place going to Coinflip, which has more than 4,200 of ATMs, Bitstop comes third place and services almost 2,500. According to data, the United States occupies the largest share of ATMs with about 83%, the highest percentage so far, showing potential future growth.The January agreement to trade basket Bitcoin ETFs in the US has sparked various debates concerning their possible influence on ATM usage for Bitcoin. But not Mintz: “Customers who buy Bitcoin ETFs usually do not differ from the price-conscious customers of the crypto ATMs, so won’t likely go exclusively to the more convenient ETF option.” To him, ETFs could be the driving force in permeating Bitcoin investment as more market players jump in the trend, resulting in higher ATM usage rates.

Craig Wright Asset Freeze: Why UK Court Took Drastic Action - DailyCoin


        
The UK High Court ruled that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.



Concerns grow that Wright is attempting to evade justice.



The High Court counters by ordering an asset freeze.
On March 14, the UK High Court sided with the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), determining that self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto. While Judge Mellor has yet to file his final written judgment, his ruling ended Wright’s near decade-long incessant bullying and harassment of those who questioned his Nakamoto origin story.However, in a further twist in the case, Judge Mellor granted an order on March 27 to freeze Wright’s assets worldwide. The dramatic move came in response to alleged attempts by Wright to evade court costs stemming from his resounding defeat.Craig Wright Attempts to Hide AssetsMarch 27’s court filing revealed Wright had taken suspicious actions just days after his courtroom defeat. On March 18, Wright filed a notice with Companies House informing the agency that he had transferred shares of his company, RCJBR Holding plc, to a Singapore-registered firm called DeMorgan PTE. This raised red flags for COPA, as Wright attempted to move assets offshore to avoid paying legal costs.
COPA emphasized Wright’s extensive history of dishonest behavior to bolster its claims of a legitimate risk of asset dissipation. They cited his forging of documents, lying under oath, boasting of being “judgment proof,” and defaulting on other major judgment debts, including the $140 million Kleiman v. Wright case in the US. This pattern, COPA argued, showed Wright’s tendency to engage in evasive financial maneuvering.Judge Mellor agreed with COPA’s arguments and ordered the £6 million worldwide asset freeze. The ruling mandates that by April 12, Wright must disclose all his assets and interests. The freeze amount is intended to cover COPA’s substantial legal costs in challenging Wright’s claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto. But there are doubts that Wright has the means to pay. Can Wright Pay?The court filing showed that COPA doubted Wright’s ability to pay the legal costs following his defeat. COPA suspected that BSV Association co-founder Calvin Ayre and blockchain development company nChain were funding Wright’s litigations, a claim the Australian computer scientist denied. 
Yet shortly after the March 14 ruling, in which Judge Mellor sided with COPA, Ayre announced that he was “off on an adventure” planned since 2023. He said his X account would be handed over to a team promoting his interests.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersWright’s claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto have endured for almost a decade. Now, his credibility lies in tatters. The asset freeze ordered by the UK High Court demonstrates a willingness to ensure justice prevails.Calls grow for a class action lawsuit against Craig Wright.

Sam Bankman-Fried goes to jail: Is Changpeng Zhao next? | Cryptopolitan

So, it finally happened. Sam Bankman-Fried, the dirty little criminal, was sentenced to prison. Twenty-five years. Little too little if you ask… well, anybody. But it’s still something I guess. The entire crypto community has been kind of celebrating for the past twenty-four hours. That got me thinking; there is one other person in the crypto industry that America wants to throw in jail. And unlike Sammy, he’s generally admired by the community. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.However, our admiration does nothing to shield one from the long arm of America, as CZ finds himself in legal complications that have the potential to land him in prison as early as next month.Initially set for sentencing in February, his court date was mysteriously pushed to the end of April, leaving the community puzzled. Right now, CZ is on a $175 million bond.His plea of guilty to failing in maintaining a strong anti-money laundering framework at Binance didn’t come lightly. It was accompanied by a $50 million penalty and a resignation from his CEO position, a role that defined him as much as he defined it.Binance, under CZ’s watch, was a dominant force in the crypto market, grappling with a market share that most could only dream of. Yet, with dominance comes scrutiny, and with scrutiny, the uncovering of practices that often walk the fine line of legality.Starting in March 2023, Binance found itself at odds with the CFTC, accused of failing basic customer identity checks—a cornerstone of financial regulation aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.The challenges snowballed with Binance’s withdrawal from Canada in May, followed by a severe legal blow in June when the SEC lobbed 13 allegations against CZ and the platform, ranging from market manipulation to misuse of client funds.In response to the pressures, Binance announced a significant staff reduction in July, something CZ clarified was a misrepresentation in the media, emphasizing the company’s ongoing recruitment efforts. However, things reached a climactic turn in November when CZ pleaded guilty to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, leading to his resignation.Binance faced a massive $4.3 billion in fines related to various charges, spotlighting the gravity of their oversight. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments at the time over Binance’s operations implicated them in enabling a wide range of illicit activities.Before we knew it, CZ was in a hot mess. Initial plans for sentencing were scraped, and his attempts to leave the U.S. were thwarted by a judge citing him as a flight risk.Alright, wrapping this whole circus up, the million-dollar question remains: Is CZ going to don the orange jumpsuit or what? If I were a betting woman—and let’s face it, dabbling in crypto kinda makes all of us one—I’d say the odds are… complicated.Sure, the guy’s in trouble, but if there’s anything he has shown us, it’s grace and resilience. Dude’s a fighter. And let’s be for real, I’ve got a soft spot for CZ. The man is a genius who has time and time again managed to get the entire industry out of trouble. He transformed digital wallets forever. If you ask me, he is a big reason why blockchain even got to where it is right now.Jail time? Maybe, sadly. But if there is anyone who can survive this and come out dry on the other side, it’s CZ. Betting against him hasn’t been profitable historically, and I’m not about to start now.So, here’s to hoping CZ keeps his freedom and continues to be the badass crypto pioneer we’ve all come to admire.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Massive 17,000% Surge, How Much SHIB Was Burned? | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate is again on the rise, with the burn tracking website Shibburn highlighting the massive surge in the last 24 hours. This is undoubtedly a welcome development as it could positively impact SHIB’s price, which has made a decent recovery lately. 
Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges By Over 17,000%
Shibburn revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the SHIB’s burn rate had surged by over 17,000%, with 56 million SHIB tokens burned between March 27 and 28. During that period, 5.3 million SHIB tokens were burnt in a single transaction, contributing significantly to this surge. 

SHIB’s burning program was recently one of the major talking points in the SHIB community as Shiba Inu team member Ragnar drew the community’s attention to how this was setting SHIB up for further growth. So far, the burn initiative has continued to positively impact SHIB’s price whenever it is carried out on a large scale. 
Therefore, sustaining the large-scale burning of these SHIB tokens is necessary. SHIB’s burn rate has continued to be inconsistent, with times when the amount of SHIB burned is largely unimpressive. 
It is also worth mentioning that SHIB’s burn rate has declined by almost 49% in the last seven days, which again highlights the need for sustained momentum in the burning of these crypto tokens. 
Time For Shibarium To Pick Up Again
Layer-2 network Shibarium looks to be the answer to ensuring a sustained increase in the SHIB burn rate. For context, Shibarium singlehandedly contributed to over 33.8 billion SHIB tokens burned in December 2023. Meanwhile, before then, the only time the monthly SHIB burns crossed the 10 billion mark was in May 2023.

Shibarium’s importance is why much effort continues to be put into ensuring that network activity there picks up. Bitcoinist reported that Shibarium has seen a staggering 99% decline in daily transactions this month. At the time of writing, the network recorded just about 9,000 transactions in the last 24 hours. 
That is undoubtedly concerning for a network that averaged over 7 million daily transactions for most of December last year. The surge in network activity was also why the Shiba Inu team was able to burn billions of SHIB tokens that month. 
Therefore, network activity on Shibarium needs to pick up soon enough as it could play a major role in helping SHIB break its all-time high (ATH) and even surpass it. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003116, over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Craig Wright under accusation in the United Kingdom

A judge in the United Kingdom recently authorized a worldwide freezing order worth £6 million (equivalent to $7.6 million) on the assets of Craig Wright. 
This order was issued at the request of the Crypto Open Patent Alliance. This is in order to cover the legal expenses estimated at 8,471,225 dollars, necessary to challenge Wright’s statements regarding his alleged identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.
This decision was motivated by Wright’s transfer of part of these activities outside the British territory. Let’s see all the details below.

The UK court acts to prevent legal expenses evasion in the Craig Wright case
As anticipated, a judge in the United Kingdom has authorized the freezing of Craig Wright’s assets worth 6 million pounds (equivalent to 7.6 million dollars). 
This is to prevent him from avoiding the legal expenses related to his claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged creator of the Bitcoin network.
This action was taken in response to Wright transferring some of his assets out of the United Kingdom. This move followed a court ruling that refuted Wright’s claims about his identity as Nakamoto. 
As a result, Wright transferred the shares of his London-based company, RCJBR Holding, to a company based in Singapore on March 18. This according to the documents of the British court.
Judge James Mellor, in his document, expressly stated that this has raised serious concerns from the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Particularly regarding the possibility that Wright was trying to avoid the financial consequences of his legal defeat.
As a result, the judge approved a so-called “worldwide freezing order” on behalf of COPA to help cover COPA’s total legal expenses of $8,471,225 (£6,703,747.91).
Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has used his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto to advance copyright claims regarding the Bitcoin network. 
The COPA filed a lawsuit against Wright in April 2021, challenging his claims and asserting that he is not Nakamoto.
After listening to the testimonies of the first Bitcoin developers like Martti Malmi and others, the judge ruled that the evidence was “overwhelming” in proving that Wright is not Nakamoto.
Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto
As previously mentioned, the High Court of Justice in London has issued a final ruling declaring that Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, is not the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. That is, the alias of the creator of Bitcoin.
The search for Nakamoto’s identity has fascinated the Bitcoin community since its early days, with incessant speculation on who could be the true mind behind the world’s most famous cryptocurrency.
Craig Wright has emerged as one of the main contenders to claim the title of Nakamoto. However, his bold claims have sparked years of debate and ridicule within the Bitcoin community.
Despite his attempts to defend himself through legal actions, Wright suffered repeated defeats and was ultimately challenged by the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) in 2021.
During the process, Wright’s legal team has repeatedly challenged the real Satoshi to come forward and refute his claims. Fueling further speculation about the identity of the creator of Bitcoin.
However, the evidence presented by COPA has shown that Wright is not only not Satoshi. But he has also manipulated documents on a large scale, including using ChatGPT to falsify documents.
The court ruling has significant ramifications, not only for Wright, but also for the Bitcoin community as a whole. 
Wright cannot continue his legal actions against those who challenge his claim to be Satoshi. It also sets a strong legal precedent against future similar claims.
This marks the end of a long saga in Bitcoin’s history, with Wright failing to prove his identity as Nakamoto and the true creator of Bitcoin remaining a mystery still unsolved.

Solana Dev Ecosystem Welcomes Automatic Private Nodes: Details - Coin Edition


							

Helius has introduced Automatic Private Nodes to redefine Solana node deployment.



Previously, setting up dedicated nodes involved a lengthy process that took weeks.



With Automatic Private Nodes, users can set up Solana nodes with just a click.




Helius, the leading crypto developer platform exclusively on Solana, has introduced a game-changing feature set to redefine the landscape of Solana node deployment. In a recent post on X, Helius declared that “Solana will never be the same again” by introducing Automatic Private Nodes.







Helius noted that previously, setting up dedicated nodes, which are computers that help run the Solana network, involved a lengthy process with forms and back-and-forth communication. According to the team, the process typically takes hours, days, or weeks. However, the arduous setup is now over with Automatic Private Nodes.



Per the notification, Automatic Private Nodes introduces a new system where users can set up Solana nodes by clicking a few buttons on the Helius platform. In particular, users can spin up dedicated remote procedure call (RPC) nodes or Geyser nodes anywhere in the world with a click.

Web3 dev platform Mirror World launches first gaming rollup chain on Solana

Web3 application development platform Mirror World is launching the first gaming rollup on Solana.According to the March 29 announcement, the novel Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) computation engine, dubbed “Sonic,” will allow developers to deploy game engines or virtual machines of their choice on Solana via its software development kit (SDK) and power in-app transactions. At the same time, HyperGrid, the core technology of the Sonic SVM developed by Mirror World, enables gaming platforms to create their own on-ramp and cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators for Solana in-game interactions. Currently, the Mirror World SDK has been deployed to 50 gaming clients as initial distribution nodes. Three games, Mahjong Meta, Matr1x Fire and Seraph/ActozSoft, with over $30 million raised in their series rounds, have seen more than 200,000 traffic and transaction engagements generated during their gaming sessions after incorporating the Mirror World SDK. “Sonic provides natively integrated tools for payment & settlement infrastructure, as well as user engagement tools necessary to build a successful Web3 game,” Mirror World wrote. Chris Zhu, CEO of Mirror World, explained that the firm has worked with hundreds of games within the Web3 ecosystem to aid in their monetization and listing. “Sonic’s vision is to expand the existing Solana Gaming Ecosystem and process millions of requests per second per game and settle them back onto Solana L1,” Zhu stated. Another of Mirror World’s products, the Smart Marketplace SDK, allows developers to deploy a namesake nonfungible token marketplace within their decentralized application for $299 per month with a limit of $1 million in monthly transaction volume. Mirror World’s Sonic launch event. Source: World Store (by Mirror World)Solana has emerged to become a top five blockchain by market cap with a gain of 824% over the past year. However, gaming activities on Solana have lagged so far in development relative to Ethereum, with the most popular game, MomoAI, having only 80,680 unique active wallets. That said, the blockchain is gaining traction in other initiatives. In February, Solana hit an all-time high of $5 billion in nonfungible token sales. Related: Solana to outpace Ethereum in consumer applications — Former head of growth

In an interesting development, a dormant pre-mine Ethereum address containing 1,000 ETH has been activated after lying inactive for nearly nine years.Crypto data tracker Whale Alert reports that "a dormant pre-mine address containing 1,000 ETH worth $3,566,925 has just been activated after 8.7 years." The address dates back to the Ethereum network's pre-mine or ICO era, which occurred before its formal launch in 2015. It received 1,000 ETH in a Genesis transaction on July 30, 2015, and has been untouched until now. With Ethereum's price hovering around $3,556, the value of the ETH in the revived wallet is an astounding $3.56 million.Upon activation, the whale address launched a series of transactions that sent 110 ETH to three separate destination wallets. The initial transaction was a small 2 ETH, followed by another transfer of 8 ETH hours later, and eventually a larger transfer of 100 ETH.Dormant addresses that resurface after years of inactivity frequently pique the community's interest and stoke speculation. The unexpected activation of this address raises concerns regarding its owner's intentions and the motivations behind the transfer.The wallet might be a long-lost one with the owner just finding its keys and reactivating it. Another reason might be that the owner chose to "hodl" and determined that now might be the right time to sell.The identity of the user behind the address, who is an early ETH adopter, is unknown, adding another element of intrigue to the plot.Several instances have surfaced recently of inactive pre-mine Ethereum addresses reactivating after years of dormancy. This draws attention to Ethereum's early adopters and the progression in value of the ETH cryptocurrency over the years.At the time of writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was trading flat, mirroring Bitcoin's performance. Ethereum is currently down 0.48% in the last 24 hours to $3,556, extending its sideways trading since March 25 with prices ranging between $3,450 and $3,670.

Bitcoin miner's shocking $800M offering sends stock plummeting

CleanSpark stock crashed during the after-hours trading session on Thursday. The conference details an adjustment in the company’s at-the-market (ATM) offering agreement alluded to. The Company announced that it would have the right to sell up to $800 million in stock, while the agreement previously signed with H.C. Wainwright & Co. the selling for $500 million was done on January 5, 2024.Amendment to ATM offering agreementCleanSpark disclosed a revised ATM offering agreement in which they had the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2023. With this restructuring, the corporation now has the legal rights to create and sell its shares of common stock at $0.001 per share. CleanSpark is one of the miners doing this alongside others, including Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings, by using this vital agreement to make capital.It took only some seconds to see the stock of CleanSpark down by a huge margin when it fell 16% and closed at $19.1 after the news was made available for after-hours trade. The drop inflated with dusk had a speed of 8.2% percent, and the bots’ hindrance during regular stock market times surpassed with data from Google Finance. The trading capitalization on the current market amounts to $4.2 billion; the $800 million proposed stock offering is intended to reduce the number of owners, leading to 19% dilutions.Poise before the Bitcoin halvingThe organization’s setup for the Bitcoin epoch, as indicated by the strategic decisions to clean a rock, comes along with the preparation for the halving event that will be experienced in April. In this event, the miners will be paid half of their reward for the contributions to the system, resulting in 3.125 BTC ($220,500) instead of the previous 6.25 BTC ($441,000). Moreover, Clean Spark has a post-halving cost structure in Bitcoin mining that is the lowest among miners, as indicated in the Jan. 12 study by CoinShares, which is calculated at $26,900.The CleanSpark team has vigorously built a bigger enterprise to prepare for the up-and-coming halving event. The company said on Thursday, outlining the plan to double its hash rate over the next six months, that it has agreed to purchase four new mining facilities, which retail for about $19.8 million, in Mississippi. With these facilities, the mine increased its capacity by 2.4 EH/s.To that effect, CleanSpark also intended to get hold of another Dalton, Georgia facility for $6.9 million. Yet, according to the company’s plan, it is a fresh production that will be operational in April 2024, and its hash rate will be equal to 0.8 EH/s.

Hot Moments: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Makes Important Statements on Live Broadcast - Here Are All Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


FED President Jerome Powell made important statements about the current state of the economy and the FED's monetary policy in his meeting with Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal.
Powell started his speech by stating that the initial opinion regarding Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) was in line with expectations and that he found this encouraging. He also stated that the February data was in line with what the FED wanted to see.


To gain confidence about inflation, Powell emphasized the need for better data like last year's. He expressed his opinion that the FED's approach is stable and they are making progress. He also clarified that they did not overreact to last year's good data and will not overreact to this year's two high months.
Powell warned that cutting rates too soon would be devastating, and waiting too long could cause unnecessary harm to the economy and labor market. He stated that the economy is poised to perform in unexpected ways and emphasized that the risks are two-sided.





The FED President reiterated that they are prepared for the economy to perform in unexpected ways and that they can and will be careful about this decision. He also expressed his confidence in the strength of the economy.
Powell said monetary policy is well positioned to respond to a number of different inputs. He stated that there is no need to rush to reduce interest rates and that they can wait and be more confident before making such a decision. Making the right decision is the most important thing in order of importance, Powell said. He added that the policy is working with a delay and they are now in a position to deal with any situation.



Powell said they wanted to be more sure before lowering interest rates. Additionally, Powell summarized the following in his speech:

The data surprised us; We must be unusually humble and ready for different results.
We say that we expect inflation to move towards 2%, sometimes on a bumpy path.
If our baseline scenario does not come true, we will keep interest rates where they are for longer.
We don't know where interest rates will return when all this is over.
My own expectation is that interest rates will not fall to the very low levels they were before the epidemic.
The economy is not harmed by this interest rate.
Studies on inflation have not yet been completed, but the risks regarding the FED's two targets are better balanced.
If we see unexpected weakness in the labor market, this could spark a policy response.
There is no doubt that our economy is strong, our labor market is strong and we have made progress on inflation, which shows that we have a chance to reduce inflation while our economy is still strong.
The likelihood of a recession is not high right now. We have a chance to reduce inflation without harming the economy.
There is no reason to think that the economy is in recession or on the verge of recession.
At such a time, off-cyclical interest rate cuts will never occur.
The fact that the decision was taken unanimously does not mean that there are no different opinions.
Interest rate decisions do not take full shape before the policy meeting.
It's really helpful to hear different opinions so you can test your own perspective.

Bitcoin exchanges' BTC balances have dropped almost $10B in 2024

Will Bitcoin (BTC) Break its $73.8K ATH Following This Record USDC Transfer?


																Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure.
CryptoQuant’s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase.
$1.4 Billion USDC Inflow
Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem.
When there’s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin.
It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom.




Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst ‘maartunn’ in his latest update.
“Several hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase bitcoin.”
Increased Demand for Exposure to Bitcoin
Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month.
Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand.
Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels.
Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.

Spark protocol deploys new DAI markets on Morpho’s lending protocol - Blockworks


Spark, a Maker SubDAO-built DeFi infrastructure, has deployed $100 million in new DAI liquidity with Morpho Blue, Morpho’s lending protocol. This move allows users to borrow Ethena’s stablecoins, USDe and sUSDe, at highly efficient leveraged positions backed by MakerDAO.
Ethena’s USDe is backed 1:1 to the US dollar and collateralized with institutional custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu and Cobo. sUSDe is a value accruing “internet bond,” or a staked version of the USDe asset.
In addition to creating new DAI markets, a DAI vault has been built on MetaMorpho, a protocol that enables vaults to be created on Morpho Blue to ensure that DAI liquidity is allocated to these markets. Performance fees on the vault will be initially set to zero, and Maker’s Direct Deposit Module (DDM) will receive all fees accrued.
Read more: Maker moves to meet demand for DAI
This collaboration has mostly been driven by MakerDAO’s endgame plan, with Spark protocol being part of a newly formed SubDAO in the Maker ecosystem. Sam MacPherson, the CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs — the infrastructure company behind Spark — noted in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that this collaboration will unlock novel opportunities for the DeFi lending ecosystem.
“MakerDAO’s groundbreaking SubDAO dynamic has enabled this development as well as the overall rapid growth of Spark. It is a testament to the efficiency of DeFi when a new product launches with a killer value proposition and succeeds in the manner which Spark has done,” MacPherson said.
While SparkLend’s initial lending infrastructure utilized Aave v3’s codebase, the decision to expand its capabilities using Morpho is driven by the programmability of Morpho Blue, which enables its users to choose risk parameters and customize lending pools. 
“It’s exciting to see Morpho’s trustless and efficient infrastructure approach to lending being embraced by DeFi’s largest and fastest-growing protocols.” Morpho Labs CEO and co-founder Paul Frambot remarked in a press release. “Users will be able to borrow DAI with a much broader diversity of collateral, greatly expanding the scope of lending and borrowing opportunities for users.”
Maker’s decision to work with Morpho comes soon after blockchain analytics company Gauntlet terminated its contracted work as risk steward for Aave and became a Morpho Labs risk curator. It also follows Aave’s decision to exclude Morpho users from its latest alignment reward program.

Easter comes with chocolate prices rising faster than Bitcoin

A cocoa podPhoto: Francis Kokoroko (Reuters)Talk about sweet returns. As Easter approaches, the cost of chocolate candy ingredient cocoa has spent the year skyrocketing. Spot prices are up more than 127% since the end of 2023. That’s a better winter than Bitcoin. Despite all the hype as it approaches new records, the digital currency is only up a paltry 57% this year.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Though many chocolate producers hedge their costs months in advance so  they’re not exposed to the volatility of spot markets — Hershey told investors its cocoa supplies were locked up a year out —the jump in cocoa prices is still a bright spot on their radars.“From a cocoa bean price point of view, it is an unprecedented price hike,”  Martin Hug, CFO of Lindt and Ghirardelli parent company Lindt & Sprüngli, said during an earnings call earlier this month. The commodity is three times as expensive as it was the same time a year ago in spot markets.Much of Bitcoin’s appreciation during its renewed hype cycle has come from a flood of new investor capital in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which the Securities and Exchange Commission approved earlier this year. On top of that, investors are staring down a so-called Bitcoin halving event, when Bitcoin miners will see half as much of their rewards. Previous halving events have sent Bitcoin prices higher.Cocoa, on the other hand, is rising in value because its supply has been severely constrained by climate change. Periods of intense rain followed by drought have reduced crop yields in addition to swollen root disease that is also affecting the health of cocoa trees. Making matters worse (or better, depending on which side of the trade you’re on), Bloomberg reports that the cocoa rally has been so extreme that traders are being forced to sell short positions they held as part of normal hedging.

Binance Executive Escapes Nigerian Detention with Fake Passport Amid Tax Evasion Charges



                    
A Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, reportedly managed to escape from detention in Nigeria using a counterfeit passport, a situation revealed by local sources. 



This development is part of a broader controversy involving the cryptocurrency exchange, as the Nigerian government has initiated criminal charges against Binance for alleged tax evasion, with legal proceedings starting at the Federal High Court in Abuja.




Anjarwalla, alongside Tigran Gambaryan, was held in Abuja, detained in a guest house for an extended period. 



The escape occurred after Anjarwalla was allowed to leave for prayers, subsequently boarding a flight from Abuja with a Kenyan passport, despite his original British passport being held by Nigerian authorities. 



Questions have arisen on how he managed to acquire this Kenyan passport and board an international flight without his primary travel documents.




The detention of these Binance executives, Anjarwalla serving as the regional manager for Africa and Gambaryan leading the criminal investigations team, began on February 26 following a magistrate court’s decision.

The court’s actions were based on a criminal complaint, granting the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) permission to detain them for 14 days, a period which was later extended due to non-compliance by Binance with a court order to provide data on Nigerian traders.



The Binance spokesperson stated, “We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. 



Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue.” 



This statement highlights the organization’s concern and ongoing cooperation with local authorities regarding the situation.



The case has shed light on the Nigerian government’s strict stance against financial crimes, especially those involving terrorist financing and money laundering. 



Reports suggest Binance’s platform has been implicated in laundering nearly $21 billion, prompting stringent measures against the exchange and individuals associated with it. 



This incident not only underscores the complexities of regulating cryptocurrency exchanges but also the challenges in maintaining the integrity of financial transactions on a global scale.

Cheatsheet: Vitalik Buterin says there’s nothing ‘new and interesting’ about memecoins - Blockworks


Bitcoin (BTC) continued to stay above $70,000, despite a week filled with legal news in the crypto space from KuCoin to Coinbase. And, of course, the sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried. 
Ethereum (ETH) hovered around $3,500 at time of publication, down slightly in the last 24 hours but still up 8% over the last seven days.
Dogwifhat (WIF) is up over 13% at time of publication, trading around $3.72. Litecoin and Filecoin were up 10.5% and roughly 10% respectively.

Crypto can still have fun without racist memecoins: Buterin
Vitalik Buterin, on Friday, penned a post on memecoins and where they stand in this cycle as racist and sexist memecoins continue to pop up. 
“This time, they are heating up again, but in a way that is making many people feel uneasy, because there isn’t anything particularly new and interesting about the memecoins,” Buterin wrote.
Buterin cited a recent post from Polynya, a pseudonymous Ethereum blogger, who announced that they were going to stop writing about crypto under their current pseudonym due to the “aggressive cultural shift” in crypto.
Read more: Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork
“Things have hit an all-new bottom with 2024: racist, sexist, and other shitheaded memecoins which are merely a vehicle to transfer wealth from the many to the most obnoxious people on the planet.” they wrote. 
He noted that there are a few ways to approach the current environment: virtue-signal or ask how the concept can be utilized to benefit multiple parties.
“If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?” he asked.
He added two potential avenues to maintain the fun that some are looking for in crypto while also benefiting specific parties. One such avenue are charity coins, which donate either part of the token supply or create a fee mechanism dedicated to a specific charity. Though he notes that the avenue may “create something fundamentally limited.”
Then there are “Robin Hood games.” Buterin urges people to consider making games that are “actually meaningful and fun” not just “Candy Crush on the blockchain.” His example for this? World of Warcraft.
Read more: Traditional gaming needs Web3 more than ever
Axie Infinity, prior to the $600 million hack, was a boon for people in some Southeast Asian countries, he noted. The goal would be to make a game that’s interesting but also benefits lower-income players, instead of potentially harming them.
“I value people’s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it. And so I want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just by ‘bringing in users’) get more mindshare,” Buterin wrote.
Crypto business
On Thursday, Kerrisdale Capital announced that they’re long bitcoin, but short MicroStrategy. 
“The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” Kerrisdale wrote. MicroStrategy Chairman and founder Michael Saylor has previously pushed back against questions around his company’s role now that the spot bitcoin ETFs are on the market. 
He previously said that spot bitcoin ETFs could mark “institutional adoption of bitcoin as an asset class.”
Kerrisdale also noted that MicroStrategy’s operating business doesn’t contribute “meaningful value” to the enterprise overall. The software business also hasn’t shown a lot of topline growth in years. 
“Leverage cuts both ways and while MicroStrategy has succeeded in increasing the amount of bitcoin held, the impact of massive dilution has also kept the amount of bitcoin per share virtually unchanged in recent years,” the report stated.

The stock market’s closed for Good Friday, but MicroStrategy closed down 11% Thursday following the short report.
Coinbase closed 3% higher on the day by end of trading Thursday, despite the exchange notching a slight loss against the SEC in its fight to dismiss the regulatory agency’s suit.
“This Friday marks one of the biggest expiries in Deribit’s history as USD 9.5 billion BTC options open interest out of USD 26.3 billion will expire (40%) plus USD 5.7 billion ETH options open interest out of a total of USD 13.2 billion (43%),” Deribit noted.

Maker DAO To Reduce Borrowing Fees And Increase Spark Debt Ceiling - The Defiant

Fees will drop 2 ppts to 13%, while the debt ceiling will rise to $2.5 billion from $1 billion.
MakerDAO, the decentralized lending protocol and issuer of the DAI stablecoin, has approved an executive proposal that brings a series of changes to the protocol.Changes include a 2 percentage point drop in stability fees for ETH, stETH, BTC, and WBTC; raising SparkLend’s debt ceiling to $2.5 billion from $1 billion, funding $100 million into DAI liquidity pools on Morpho through Spark, decreasing DAI’s savings rate to 13% from 15%, among other changes.Dropping stability fees today come less than a month after MakerDAO voted on March 10 to raise fees by 140% to prevent “DAI demand spike.”“Maker stakeholders should understand that further changes are likely to be introduced in the near future, which is highly dependent on the development of market dynamics, including prices, leverage demand and external rate environment including CeFi funding rates and DeFi effective borrowing rates,” wrote BA Labs, which put forward the proposal.The approved proposal also raises SparkLend’s debt ceiling to $2.5 billion from $1.5 billion, expanding the current $614 million borrowed on Spark.In pursuit of their so-called Endgame, MakerDAO is also allocating $100 million DAI to deploy the Spark DAI Morpho Vault. The new DAI market will offer investors access to Ethena’s USDe and sUSDe stablecoins.

Dogwifhat Triumphs Over PEPE to Claim Third-Largest Memecoin Title - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s pink hat-wearing memecoin WIF emerges as the day’s top gainer.



The 16% surge for Dogwifhat is ascribed to high demand for WIF’s Derivatives.



Derivatives traders put Dogwifhat in the spotlight, with volume topping $2.55B.
Dogwifhat (WIF) has left the popular frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) in the dust during an early morning rally on Good Friday. Intriguingly, WIF snatched the third spot by global market capitalization from PEPE while claiming a new all-time high (ATH).Solana’s memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) reached a new all-time high at $4 at nearly 3AM GMT but later faced a retracement to $3.59. Comparing the global market cap, WIF now sports a $3,603,273,643 market cap, outsourcing PEPE’s market capitalization by over $300 million.Claiming a bronze medal in the meme currency department, Dogwifhat now aims to challenge the two top dogs, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), but the difference is huge. While the leading memecoin DOGE encircles a $30 billion market cap, Shiba Inu’s $18bn market cap is approximately six times larger than WIF’s.PEPE’s Glory Days Are Over?As PEPE was forced to step aside in the charts, it may be thought that the one-year-old coin is losing its relevance. However, judging solely by social metrics, PEPE’s dominance among memecoins remains strong. 
To illustrate, the last 24-hour period has garnered 7,719,552 interactions for PEPE across social media channels. By this metric, PEPE only compares to SHIB, which produced slightly over 7 million interactions. This is a huge contrast to the price movements of PEPE and WIF, as the latter fetched less than 1 million interactions during the same time frame.Coming off a new all-time high at $0.00001064, set on March 14, 2024, PEPE has already retraced 26.8% from the milestone. PEPE will first have to conquer the piling sell pressure to restore this price range, as the combined liquidity book showcases a $7 million gap between pending buys and sells.On the Flipside
Despite PEPE often being the most mentioned memecoin in social media and having a substantially larger liquidity on Spot markets, Derivatives markets tell a different story.



Dogwifhat’s Derivatives trades have topped $2.54 billion over the past 24 hours, accelerating WIF’s Open Interest (OI) by 17% to $502 million, according to CoinGlass.

$1,800,000 Up for Grabs As US City Launches Guaranteed Income Program With 'Unrestricted Cash Payments' - The Daily Hodl


								A new guaranteed income pilot project is gearing up for launch in Massachusetts.
The Somerville Guaranteed Basic Income Program is a $1.8 million pilot project designed to hand out $750 per month for one year to 200 families who are in danger of losing their homes.










The city is expected to draw funds from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), with the first round of monthly payments set to begin in July.
The city says it will proactively find families with a history of housing instability to create a pool of participants who can apply for the program.
“Guaranteed income programs provide unrestricted cash payments directly to vulnerable residents to create greater financial stability for those most in need. 
Somerville’s program goes beyond that general goal; it also specifically aims to support housing stability. The City’s program will serve a group of the city’s lowest-income households who are at risk of losing their housing…
This pilot program will be evaluated for its impact, efficacy, and future feasibility in partnership with the UMass Center for Social Policy and the Collins Center. Outcomes will be shared with the public and will inform future advocacy and any potential initiatives.”
At least 24 states across the US are launching various types of basic income programs, with over $200 million allocated to see how direct cash payments can help people and families in need.

CNC Agency Launches Innovation Lab to Merge AI with Physical Experiences

Independent experiential agency CNC Agency, previously known as Coffee ‘N Clothes, has launched an innovation division to focus on artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and immersive content. This strategic move combines creative and technological strategies that provide new dimensions to the physical experiences. First founded in 2014 as an Instagram hashtag, CNC Agency believes their background in experiential and digital marketing makes them stand out in this venture.Innovative offerings for brandsUnveiled in January, the new CNC Innovation Lab will solve the problems of brands looking to differentiate in the market. It has eight pillars: AI, Immersive Spaces, AR, Fake Out of Home (FOOH), Creative Engineering, Gaming, Wearables, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Ryan Glick, the founder of CNC Agency, stated that the lab will concentrate on pushing the technological boundaries and offer innovative, tailor-made solutions for brands really willing to excel.AI, specifically, is set to more and more take a more critical role in the gap that exists between digital and physical content. Glick said that clients are more and more geared toward business problems as opposed to technological challenges. The agency wants to use AI to create immersive and personal content that delves into high-con’s imaginative concepts, such as using AI to simulate a Louis Vuitton pop-up ski resort. In this view, the CNC plans to integrate more of the emerging hardware and even the digital content in this immersive space by using technologies such as projection mapping, VR, mixed reality, and robotics.Client testimonials and industry analysisOne such client is Dylan Abruscato, the founder of the digital game “Crypto,” who praised CNC Agency for being the only firm that came back consistently with creative ideas across projects. Analysts say agencies like CNCs have an advantage as clients take tentative steps into AI and other emerging technologies. Stefanie Beach, CEO of SMB Media Consulting, pointed to the fact that the specialty in solutions and industry expertise will be the prime factor in breaking through the colossal completion in the agency landscape. With the evolution of AI in the agency world, it expects even more from agencies developing use cases for clients and expanding focus areas—just as CNC is doing. However, there are some challenges in translating AI experiments into billable work for the agencies.That’s because, while the approaches lead to conversation starters for tests, what’s actually sold is mostly work on machine learning, app development, and traditional agency services. CNC Agency setting up an Innovation Lab is synonymous with the strategic alignment between technological innovation and experiential marketing. The agency aims to provide avant-garde solutions that separate brands in this highly competitive landscape with advanced technologies like AI, AR, and immersive content. With the industry still developing, agencies have to grapple with challenges in translating experimental technologies into tangible, billable services. However, the launching of the CNC Innovation Lab is a huge step in repositioning what was initially referred to as the crossroads of digital and physical experience with an environment ideal for advancing marketing and branding strategies.

Dogecoin to the moon? Market reacts to DOGE's 3-year price high - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin surged to $0.21, attracting retail and institutional investor’s interest.
Dogecoin GigaWallet v1.0 releases and DOGE futures debut hints at growth potential.

In recent days, the spotlight has once again turned to Dogecoin [DOGE], the meme-based cryptocurrency that has captured widespread attention. Surging nearly 37.39% within a week to reach $0.22, the coin has sparked the interest of both retail and institutional investors. 
All thanks to the GameStop saga starting in January 2021, fueled by small investors and Reddit’s WallStreetBets community, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk for endorsing the dog-themed memecoin. 
DOGE breaks its previous record 
According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE reached its highest point in three years at $0.22. This surge aligned with the growth of wallet addresses on its blockchain, now at 6.27 million with the introduction of GigaWallet v1.0. 
Remarking on the same, Dogecoin Foundation noted,
“Dogecoin GigaWallet v1.0 has been released. Thank you to the early adopters already building great solutions on Dogecoin.”
The tweet further elaborated,
“GigaWallet is a backend service which provides a convenient integration API for platforms such as online shops, exchanges, social media platforms etc, to programmatically transact Dogecoin.”
Moreover, there’s continued excitement for the 1st of April debut of DOGE futures on Coinbase, hinting at potential price spikes.
Jumping into the fray @david_dogecoin said, 
“BTC is about to cross. When that crosses, dogecoin will fly. To the moon.”
What will be DOGE’s next move?
Contrary to expectations, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, in conversation with The Economic Times, interprets Dogecoin’s recent performance as a stable turnaround from its low point. He predicts potential selling pressure in Dogecoin’s future. 
Hence, with its recent milestones and upcoming developments, the future of Dogecoin remains uncertain, leaving investors eagerly anticipating the next twist.

Ripple Shares 2 Major Technical Advances For The XRP Ledger


								Ripple, through its development arm RippleX, unveiled two significant technological advancements for the XRP Ledger (XRPL). These developments involve the roll-out of a new version for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in the devnet and updates to the XRPL’s Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality. Both enhancements are pivotal in Ripple’s strategy to enhance the XRPL’s capabilities in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Ripple And Peersyst Releases New EVM Bridge
The announcement of the EVM sidechain, a collaborative effort between Peersyst Technology and Ripple, marks a notable milestone in the XRPL’s evolution. Through a statement shared by Peersyst Technology via X (formerly Twitter), the companies highlighted the completion of a significant update for the EVM sidechain.

“Exciting milestone reached on the EVM Sidechain! We are very excited to release the new version of the bridge with a new scalable interface for future #XRPLedger interoperability,” Peersyst Technology announced. This development introduces a scalable interface that promises to significantly enhance the XRPL’s interoperability capabilities.


It is designed to accommodate multiple networks, wallets for each network, and various tokens for each pair of networks. Moreover, it introduces the ability for dynamic bridge creation by users for any ERC20/IOU token, facilitating permissionless cross-chain applications with any asset. “This will allow us to add to the portal all the networks that have bridges with #XRPL and list multiple wallets for all these networks.
The development of the XRPL EVM sidechain has been structured into three phases, starting with its launch on the XRPL devnet (in October 2022) and culminating in the introduction of a permissionless EVM sidechain connected to the XRPL mainnet (to be announced). This phased approach ensures thorough testing and scalability assessments, paving the way for a robust framework that supports increased participation and interoperability with other blockchain networks.
XRP Ledger AMM Feature To Be Activated On April 11
On another front, RippleX communicated a vital update regarding the XRPL AMM feature. An amendment to fix a discovered bug has achieved over 80% consensus for activation, a development expected to take effect on April 11. RippleX urged node and validator operators to update their infrastructure to rippled version 2.1.1, emphasizing the importance of this update for the continued smooth operation of the XRPL AMM feature.


In a recent blog post, Brad Chase, a developer at RippleX, detailed the events leading up to the discovery and resolution of the bug. “Last Friday, after over two years in the making, XLS-30, the Automated Market Maker (AMM) amendment, went live on XRP Ledger mainnet. However, a bug affecting the AMM functionality was discovered the following day,” he stated.

The bug, identified with the assistance of community members Tequ and Orchestra Finance, involved an inconsistency in how the payment engine interacts with order books and AMM pools, leading to incorrect liquidity draw from an AMM pool in certain scenarios.
The rectification process involved a comprehensive approach, encompassing the development of a fix, extensive testing, and the preparation of the network for the amendment’s activation. The commitment to transparency and collaboration in addressing the bug was evident in RippleX’s communication and the mobilization of the XRPL community to mitigate the bug’s impact and ensure a swift resolution.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.62843.

Grayscale revolutionizes investments with the proof-of-stake fund

Grayscale has announced the launch of a new “variable income fund” aimed at investors with a net worth of over $2.2 million, focused on investments in proof-of-stake tokens.
Let’s see below all the details. 

The future of investments: proof-of-stake tokens with Grayscale
As anticipated, Grayscale has announced the imminent launch of a new “dynamic income fund”, focused on investing in proof-of-stake tokens, in a publication released on X.
The company has specified that the fund, identified by the ticker GDIF, will be accessible exclusively to accredited investors with a net worth of at least 2.2 million dollars.
Furthermore, Grayscale has emphasized that GDIF will represent the company’s “first actively managed investment product”. 
The stated goal of the fund will be to maximize returns through staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake digital assets. 
The fund will be responsible for managing the staking and unstaking of a series of tokens, distributing the related rewards to its investors.
While Grayscale continues to expand its range of financial products, its spot ETF on Bitcoin, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has attracted attention.
Since the beginning of trading in January, the ETF has recorded significant losses in terms of value, despite remaining the largest in terms of assets managed. 
According to The Block Data Dashboard, Grayscale ranks second in trading volume, behind only BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF.
The operational modes of GDIF
In its announcement, Grayscale clarified the functioning of GDIF, stating the following: 
“Interests in GDIF have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 … or any state or other securities law.”
Furthermore, the information disclosed by Grayscale has indicated that the fund “will not be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 of the United States”. 
Furthermore, it will not be required to adhere to certain restrictions and requirements under the Investment Company Act, and investors will not be granted the protections of the Investment Company Act. 
Grayscale optimistic about the approval of Ethereum ETFs
The legal head of Grayscale remains confident about the possible approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Ethereum (ETH) linked Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
According to Craig Salm, Ethereum ETFs “should be approved” and he urges not to be influenced by the negative rumors surrounding the proposed financial products.
Salm adds that the lack of explicit commitment from the SEC on Ethereum ETF requests should not necessarily be considered as a negative sign. 
He explained that the SEC has shown a positive and constructive commitment during the months leading up to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.
It clarified that the procedures and technical details discussed with the SEC are similar for both Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs, with the only difference being that instead of holding Bitcoin, the ETF will hold Ether.
Despite the delay of the SEC in deciding on the approval of the Ethereum ETFs proposed by BlackRock and Grayscale, Salm expresses optimism about the approval process. 
Therefore, not considering the lack of commitment from the regulatory authority as indicative of a negative outcome.
The SEC has recently postponed the decision date on the proposed Ethereum ETFs by Hashdex and Ark 21Shares, moving the deadline from March 31 to May 30, to have more time to evaluate the proposed rules.

Crypto, it’s time to demand clarity from the courts - Blockworks


On March 25, 2024, Beba, a small apparel company located in Waco, TX, partnered with the DeFi Education Fund to file a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The suit challenges the SEC’s statements that there may be securities law implications with Beba’s intent to sell duffel bags to people at a discounted price.
No, you did not read that incorrectly.
If your first reaction was to ask “why would the SEC be involved in this at all?,” then your reaction probably lines up with the overwhelming majority of people who are familiar with securities law and/or duffel bags. 
Now, let me introduce an additional piece to the puzzle: Beba plans to gatekeep access to the sale, making its duffel bags available exclusively to holders of a specific blockchain token.
This small detail reveals why it is so important that a company like Beba takes this action. The SEC’s actions over the past several years have made the operating environment for crypto native companies attempting to do things the right way nigh-impossible. There is no clear path to compliance. This uncertainty has also empowered the worst actors in the space by removing the usual guard rails that would serve as signals to protect the average investor.
Why? The SEC has failed to write rules for crypto, with the exception of a clear statement that effectively bans US banks from acting as custodians (SAB 121). This means we have an operating environment where there is no good legal framework to determine the good actors from the bad. As a result, the average investor can’t tell FTX from Coinbase. To add to that, the SEC continues to enforce securities laws based on undisclosed and contradictory interpretations, so what is a company that wants to follow the law supposed to do? How is a company supposed to ensure compliance when they don’t know what to comply with?
This brings us back to duffel bags. What Beba intends to do is simple: distribute tokens via blockchain airdrops that would allow recipients to buy its bags at a discount. If this was done via a private wallet app, via the US postal service or just by handing out flyers on the street, it would be uncontroversially clear that this was not a securities offering. However, the direct involvement of blockchain technology introduces ambiguity due to the SEC’s vague regulations, leaving Beba uncertain whether its distribution methodology could inadvertently trigger a securities enforcement action.
To counter this, Beba is doing something that I have suggested for years: Demand clarity from the courts. This is something that I believe is the correct path forward if Congress will not act and the SEC continues with its incoherent, contradictory approach to crypto. 
In the end, the United States is a nation governed by laws, where individuals and entities have rights. And at a bare minimum, the SEC needs to obey the law and respect the rights of Americans. In one case already, the SEC was sanctioned by a federal judge for making false claims so egregious about the DEBT Box platform that the regulator was forced to pay the platform’s legal fees. With this in mind, it is completely appropriate for crypto projects to try to move forward by taking their own actions to force the SEC to give both legal clarity and fair treatment.
Read more from our opinion section: Yes, staking actually should be regulated
Given the SEC’s notorious position of silence, Beba’s process of securing a response from the commission becomes more crucial than the actual details of that response. If there is a coherent and clear theory for why this activity does fit neatly within the securities regulatory framework, the SEC should just articulate that so people can act accordingly. Yet, so far they have refused to do so. 
Even SEC Commissioners themselves are calling the agency out for the complete disarray they have created for investors and builders, with both Commissioner Hester Pierce and Mark Uyeda including a parody of interactions with the SEC in a dissent that ends as follows:
“FSS [crypto platform]: I’ve read about your enforcement actions.  I still have questions.
SEC: Hire a lawyer. 
FSS:  I did, and the lawyer has even more questions. 
SEC: Sorry, we cannot help any more than we already have. We don’t give legal advice.”Should it be this way? No. The SEC needs to stop obfuscating and obstructing, and instead return to its core job of regulating securities laws effectively. Congress also needs to step in, both to pass legislation to create legal clarity and to rein in the SEC so this conduct cannot expand to other industries.
Finally, when regulators refuse to comply with demands for fair treatment and clarity, and Congress remains unresponsive, the American judicial system stands as a crucial avenue for redress. It’s time the crypto space starts using it effectively.

Former FTX Execs To Pay $1.3 Million in Lawsuit Settlement Deal


                        
                            Former FTX Executives and Promoters To Pay $1.35 Million in Lawsuit Settlement Deal

Several FTX executives have agreed to settle a class action lawsuit following founder Sam Bankman-Fried's sentencing yesterday.
                        Following Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing, former FTX executives and promoters agreed to a $1.3 million class action lawsuit settlement, according to court documents filed yesterday.Former head of engineering for FTX, Nishad Singh, Alameda Research CEO, Caroline Ellison, chief technological officer for FTX, Gary Wang, and seven promoters of the bankrupt exchange have all agreed to forfeit a total sum of $1.3 million following claims that they participated in and perpetuated ringleader Sam Bankman-Fried’s multi-billion dollar fraud on FTX customers.FTX Executives Pay Up in Lawsuit Settlement
In addition to having “pled guilty in the criminal proceedings against them,” FTX insiders  “have agreed to full restitution and forfeiture” of the designated sum. The agreement will allow Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who presided over the U.S. government’s case over Sam Bankman-Fried case, to decide “how the FTX victim funds recovered from them will be provided to the FTX victims.”“The FTX collapse—the rapid unraveling of one of the world’s biggest scams—is certainly one of recent history’s greatest financial disasters,” the settlement reads. “For over a year, Plaintiffs and MDL Counsel have worked tirelessly to efficiently litigate these claims to benefit all FTX Victims. Today, those efforts begin to bear fruit.”Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced To 25 Years, $11 Billion Fine
The FTX lawsuit agreement follows Bankman-Fried’s March 28th sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court which saw the now disgraced FTX founder sentenced to 25 years in prison.Judge Kaplan compared Bankman-Fried’s massive digital asset fraud to a game where he weighed the chances of getting caught “against the gain of getting away without getting caught, given the probabilities.”In addition to his lengthy sentence, Bankman-Fried has been ordered to pay over $11 billion in forfeiture.“I know a lot of people feel really let down, and they were right, they were, were very let down,” Bankman-Fried told the court. “I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry about what happened at every stage, things I should have done and said, and things I shouldn’t have. I failed everyone I care about and everything I care about too.”He, however, doubled down on the belief that the crypto exchange “always” had enough assets to cover its losses and that he was “hopeful” and “optimistic” that the exchange would pay back customers, lenders, and investors in the near future.FTX Bankruptcy Estate In Hot Water
Meanwhile, the FTX bankruptcy estate continues to trudge numerous legal challenges, most recently acquiring Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary to investigate law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interest with the crypto exchange.The law firm is also facing a February 2023 class action lawsuit from several FTX investors who claim Sullivan and Cromwell “got rich” off Bankman-Fried’s businesses.“S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain,” the lawsuit reads.Bankman-Fried has been ordered to live out his sentence in a medium-security prison given in part to his connection to “vast wealth.” He has two weeks from the date of the court’s judgment submission to appeal the case.

Bitcoin’s 2023-2024 growth rate has it on track to surpass Microsoft within a year

Bitcoin has had a banner year so far in 2024. It reached a new all-time high price of $73,679 on March 13, and in the time since, it’s hung around the $70,000 threshold — putting it up more than 140% over the same time last year. When Bitcoin (BTC) reached its 2024 peak (so far) and new all-time high, it briefly surpassed silver as the eighth most valuable commodity in the world by market capitalization. Related: Bitcoin price nails new $73.6K all-time high as ETFs eat away at supplyIn the current market situation, if one could fast-forward another year under the exact same growth rate, Bitcoin would reach a price of approximately $170,574 by the beginning of April 2025. This would put it ahead of silver today, as well as Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Saudi Aramco, Nvidia and Microsoft to take the second-place spot on CompaniesMarketcap’s list of the top 100 commodities by capitalization. Source: CompaniesMarketCapWhile this number only holds water when imagining a scenario where Bitcoin grows and the rest of the market remains static, today’s market capitalizations can be used as a measuring stick for what Bitcoin’s potential future growth could look like.SilverIf silver’s market cap remains at its current value of $1.412 trillion, Bitcoin could surpass it again by increasing its current price point from $69,678 (as of the time of this article’s publication) to $71,732. This would give Bitcoin a total market capitalization of approximately $1.413 trillion and sole possession of the eighth-place spot on the list. GoogleThe Mountain View search giant currently has a market capitalization of $1.885 trillion, just $12 billion ahead of Amazon. Bitcoin can surpass them both and claim the sixth-place spot on the list by reaching a price of approximately $95,642 to surpass a market cap of $1.885 trillion. This would put it squarely behind Saudi Aramco, which currently sits in fifth place with a cap of $1.984 trillion. MicrosoftFourth and third on the list are occupied by Nvidia and Apple, respectively. Bitcoin will have to reach a total market value of about $2.65 trillion in order to slide into third place and have a shot at knocking Microsoft out of its second-place slot. The number to beat there, if Bitcoin is to surpass Microsoft’s $3.126 trillion cap and reach number two on the list, is approximately $165,608 per BTC.While this might seem lofty given its current price at just under $70,000, it’s worth remembering that the price of Bitcoin increased by approximately 144.82% year over year from April 2023 through the end of March 2024.If Bitcoin increased by 144.82% in the next year, from its current value of $69,678, it would reach approximately $170,574. At this price, its market cap would be approximately $3.224 trillion, more than enough to overtake Microsoft. GoldOnce Bitcoin secures second place — again, assuming the entire market remained static and BTC’s price alone rose —its price would need to be approximately $800,476 per BTC to achieve a market cap of $15.15 trillion. This would beat gold’s current cap of $15.141 trillion and give the world’s first cryptocurrency the top slot on the market cap leaderboard.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Giving Out 2020 Cycle Vibes, Suggests Real BTC Bull Market Is Underway - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant believes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cycle may be mirroring the prior one in 2020-21.
Ki Young Ju tells his 341,600 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin is following the price patterns of the prior cycle the crypto king’s “real” bull market is just kicking off.










The analyst parses Bitcoin’s cycle into three main phases: recovery, the bull market to the previous all-time high and the real bull market, when Bitcoin prints new all-time highs.
“Bitcoin gives me the same vibe as four years ago. 
2020-21: 

$3,000-$9,000 (Recovery). 
$9,000-$19,000 (Bull market to previous all-time high). 
$20,000-$68,000 (The real bull market). 

2023-24: 

$15,000-$45,000 (Recovery). 
$45,000-$68,000 (Bull market to previous all-time high). 
$68,000-$___,000 (The real bull market).” 

The analyst also believes that on-chain data is showing long-time deep-pocketed investors are selling Bitcoin as the price hovers around the prior all-time high of about $69,000, but traditional finance (TradFi) groups are buying up the supply.
“Old whales are selling Bitcoin to new whales (TradFi), not retail investors. This can be clearly observed on-chain.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
The analyst previously said that the level of Bitcoin investment from institutional investors is unprecedented this cycle, totaling $86 billion in the last six months alone.
Bitcoin is trading for $69,286 at time of writing, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.

Taiwan is Trying to Get Ahead of Rival Countries in the Cryptocurrency Industry! They Approved Another Innovation! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Taking an important step towards formalizing the cryptocurrency industry, Taiwan's Ministry of Internal Affairs has approved the establishment of an industry association by the local crypto industry.
This move marks the government's progress towards regulating the domestically developing cryptocurrency space.


Taiwan Approves Formation of Crypto Industry Association, Approaches Regulatory Framework
The local cryptocurrency industry working group, which met last year to pave the way for the establishment of an industry association, announced today that it has received official approval from the government for its application.
The green light from the authorities marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in Taiwan.





According to the working group, the next step includes completing all necessary preparations to officially establish the crypto industry association by the end of June in accordance with government requirements.
This milestone underscores collaborative efforts between industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities to create a framework for responsible cryptocurrency transactions in Taiwan.



Currently, the working group consists of 22 cryptocurrency firms, including leading exchanges such as MaiCoin and BitoPro.
ACE Exchange, in particular, was removed from the group by prosecutors amid ongoing investigations into alleged misconduct by its former executives.





The establishment of a crypto industry association represents a significant step towards self-regulation in the industry.
While Taiwan currently requires cryptocurrency service providers to comply with anti-money laundering laws introduced by the Financial Supervisory Commission in July 2021, the broader crypto industry remains largely unregulated.

HKVAEX announces full shutdown amid regulatory pressure - Crypto Briefing




HKVAEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto trading platform allegedly backed by Binance, will completely cease its operations in May, according to a Thursday notice. The decision comes one day after the exchange withdrew its application for a Virtual Asset Trading Platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong.
“We are writing to you to announce that, HKVAEX will commence a phased suspension of services starting from April 1 2024. This will lead to a complete closure of our official website on [May 1 2024],” wrote the exchange.
Starting April 1, HKVAEX will phase out its services, which will lead to the full termination of its website the following month. The exchange has already ceased new registrations and virtual asset deposits.Trading will end on April 5, with all existing orders being canceled, as noted by HKVAEX. After delisting, HKVAEX will offer support for asset withdrawals until April 30. Customers are urged to withdraw their assets by the end of April.Established in December 2022, HKVAEX offers crypto exchange services under the name BX Services Limited. The exchange is allegedly linked to Binance after its promotional materials listed Binance as a “partner.” Despite these claims, Binance denies any affiliation with HKVAEX.HKVAEX filed a license application with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in January this year. However, on March 28, it withdrew its filing, according to a new update from the SFC.The reason behind HKVAEX’s decision to retract its license application remains in question. Chinese reporter WuBlockchain suggested that this “may include a request to change the audit company” or “insufficient materials.”HKVAEX’s latest move comes amid tightening government scrutiny in Hong Kong.Earlier this month, the SFC issued a public warning about BitForex, a virtual asset trading platform suspected of fraud. Despite claiming to be based in Hong Kong, the SFC claimed that BitForex had not applied for a license from the SFC for its operations.The SFC further flagged Bybit for operating without licenses within its jurisdiction, categorizing them as suspicious virtual asset trading platforms.According to a recent update from the SFC, unregistered virtual asset trading platforms must shut down their business operations in Hong Kong by the end of May.
“Virtual asset trading platforms operating in Hong Kong which have not submitted their license applications to the SFC by February 29 2024 must close down their businesses in Hong Kong by May 31 2024. Investors using these platforms should make preparations early,” stated the SFC.

$1.4 Billion USDC Moved To Coinbase: Will History Repeat And Bitcoin Rally?


								On March 29, a massive $1.4 billion transfer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle, was moved to Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges. 
Sharing a screen grab that cites CryptoQuant’s data, the analyst said the hefty inflow could suggest that bulls might be ready to inject capital. If that happens, top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit.

Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Ready To Turn The Corner?
Looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is evident that sellers might be in control, rejecting attempts for higher highs. Bitcoin trades below the $71,600 resistance level, marking March 28 highs. 

On the other hand, Ethereum is yet to fully capitalize on post-Dencun expectations to break higher, above $3,700. The coin remains under pressure, with the odds of falling below $3,200 a possibility if bulls fail to flow back.

The analyst believes that the influx of USDC into Coinbase indicates a growing willingness among investors to enter the crypto market. Stablecoins have emerged as preferred conduits for traditional finance capital to flow to crypto. 
Popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by fiat and can be redeemed for cash. Usually, stablecoin inflows into the exchange are seen as a positive development, a net positive for crypto, and mostly leading assets.
Will History Repeat? Past USDC Inflows Lifted Price
Still, while prices might expand in the coming sessions, the fact that $1.4 billion USDC was channeled into Coinbase can’t be the main fuel. The crypto and Bitcoin or Ethereum markets have deep liquidity, with sentiment mostly or big money injection from institutions as primary drivers of price. 
Previous USDC inflow | Source: Analyst on X
Even so, the general confidence is warranted. This isn’t the first time a bulk USDC transfer to Coinbase has coincided with a crypto upswing. In January 2023, the analyst notes, a $1.3 billion USDC inflow to Coinbase preceded a price spike that saw the coin rise from around $16,300. 
Therefore, with this historical precedent in mind, traders are bullish and expect a possible recovery for Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

USDC has been steadily gaining traction and is now poised to potentially dethrone XRP as the world’s sixth most valuable crypto. According to CoinMarketCap data on March 29, USDC has a market cap of $32.5 billion. On the other hand, XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, has a market cap of over $34 billion.

If the fall continues, one can expect a test of the $0.64 zone tomorrow.Image by TradingViewOn the daily time frame, neither bulls nor bears are dominating as the rate is far from the support and resistance levels. Such a statement is also confirmed by the low volume, which means ADA needs more time to accumulate energy for a further move.In this regard, ongoing consolidation in the narrow range of $0.64-$0.68 is the more likely scenario for the next days.Image by TradingViewFrom the midterm point of view, the situation is similar to the daily chart.

ARKK's Tech Bets: Over 500k Roblox Shares Purchased, 1.24M Robinhood Shares Sold - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) had an active week of trading, with a mix of buying and selling across various holdings. The ETF, known for its focus on disruptive technology companies, made significant moves in several key positions.



ARK Innovation ETF Purchased Over 500,000 Roblox Shares this Week



One of the most notable transactions was the purchase of over 500,000 shares of Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) on March 25, representing a 0.2375% increase in the ETF’s holdings. 



The gaming platform has been a popular investment for ARKK, with additional purchases of 21,508 shares on March 26 and 1,845 shares on March 27. Other significant buys included Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), with 133,334 shares added on March 25, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX), with 609,626 shares purchased on March 26.





ARK Innovation ETF Sold Over 1.24 Million Robinhood Shares this Week



However, the ETF also made some substantial sales during the week. Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) saw the largest reduction, with 1.247 million shares sold on March 25, representing a 0.3027% decrease in ARKK’s holdings. Other notable sells included Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), with 154,601 and 57,652 shares sold, respectively, on March 25. Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) also experienced a sell-off, with 104,425 shares sold on March 22 and an additional 22,835 shares sold on March 25.



Despite the sales, ARKK continued to invest in several of its key holdings. 10x Genomics (NASDAQ: TXG) saw multiple purchases throughout the week, with 53,886 shares added on March 25, 91,659 shares on March 26, and 26,811 shares on March 27.

Other buys included Pacific Biosciences of California (NASDAQ: PACB), Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA), and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU).

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


One fundamental economic aspect of cryptocurrencies that can drastically impact their price is the circulating supply inflation. When previously non-existent or locked coins are issued or unlocked, they increase their supply, which affects the trading value.
Usually, savvy cryptocurrency traders and investors consider the supply and demand dynamics to make profitable decisions and manage their risks.
On that note, Finbold encountered three cryptocurrencies with scheduled token unlocks to avoid trading next week. These three projects will unlock $232 million out of $270.58 million worth of tokens in the following seven days.

dYdX Protocol (DYDX)
The decentralized exchange protocol DYDX is again featured among cryptocurrencies to avoid trading due to its unlocks. Finbold reported a similar warning for February 29, with 33.34 million tokens unlocked – worth $130 million at that time.
Now, the protocol will put the same amount of DYDX in circulation on March 31, currently worth $117.33 million. This represents a nearly 10% loss in the month-over-month price of this DeFi cryptocurrency.
As for the distribution, early investors will receive the most of the unlocks, worth $65.07 million by press time. The team will have $35.83 million worth of DYDX to sell in the following weeks, and a reserve for future employees will take the rest, worth $16.43 million.

Sui Network (SUI)
Sui Network (SUI) is another cryptocurrency to avoid trading next week with a token unlock set to March 30. Specifically, the protocol will release 4 million SUI to the community reserve, for a value of $7.88 million.
However, TokenUnlocks.App registers a total unlock of $76.07 million worth of tokens, which are not fully disclosed in the platform’s distribution branch.

Echelon Prime (PRIME)
Finally, Echelon Prime (PRIME) will unlock $38.58 million worth of 1.66 million PRIME also on March 30. 912,040 PRIME will go to the Parallel Studios reserve and 750,000 to its private investors.
Thus, the Web3 gaming studio native token is another cryptocurrency to avoid trading next week due to expected sell-off volatility.
PRIME token unlocks on March 30. Source: TokenUnlocks.App
Nevertheless, increasing a token’s supply does not guarantee that its price will fall. If the asset manages to acquire a higher demand in the meantime, its value could still increase under these circumstances. 
Yet, traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks will have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years. What happens now?

A federal judge sentenced former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried to 25 years behind bars for his multiple felony convictions, eliciting mixed reactions from many in and out of the crypto space.On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan had some harsh words for Bankman-Fried before and after announcing consecutive sentences of 240 months and 60 months, totaling 25 years in prison. The judge compared SBF to a “thief,” said his attempts to promote regulation of crypto was “an act,” found he committed perjury and was “willing to flip a coin as to the continued existence of life on earth.”How long and where will Sam Bankman-Fried be in prison?The former FTX CEO has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since August 2023, when Judge Kaplan revoked his bail for intimidating witnesses in the criminal case. A March 28 docket entry for U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York suggested the judge would deduct time already spent in jail, meaning SBF would have a maximum of 291 months in prison — ending in 2048.According to Judge Kaplan, Bankman-Fried will serve the remainder of his time behind bars at a medium- or low-security prison in the San Francisco Bay Area. Reports suggested possible locations, including the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Herlong and FCI Mendota. It was unclear which one would house the former FTX CEO at the time of publication.Many reactions from social media following the March 28 hearing expressed doubt that Bankman-Fried would serve the entire sentence length. According to U.S. law, parole is no longer available for those sentenced to federal charges. However, inmates judged to have “good conduct” can receive 54 days off their sentence for each year served. In Bankman-Fried’s case, that would mean a reduction of roughly 3.75 years: 21.25 years served in total and less than 21 years after sentencing — presumably ending in 2045. The former CEO, now 32 years old, could be in his mid-50s even if he is released early for good behavior. Appealing the convictionBefore Judge Kaplan announced the 25-year sentence, Bankman-Fried attorney Marc Mukasey said his team intended to appeal the jury’s decision. The lawyers have 14 days to file the paperwork in court. Many from the crypto space suggested that 25 years in prison was “too light” for Bankman-Fried, given the impact on FTX users. However, some seemed to be surprised at the sentencing hearing, “I say this would apply to [Alex] Mashinsky as well: I hope that neither actually have to be in prison until the day they literally die,” said crypto influencer Tiffany Fong, who has provided many exclusives related to SBF’s case. “I personally wouldn’t have supported a 40- to 50-year sentence because I think that would basically be a life sentence for someone who’s 32 years old.”Source: Tiffany FongRelated: SBF memecoins pump and dump as FTX founder gets 25-year prison sentence“That is an insanely lengthy prison sentence, and I’m not quite sure that he needs to be in prison for a quarter century,” said Ana Kasparian, a host on progressive media outlet The Young Turks. “25 years… I feel like that is the kind of prison sentence that you would save, or you would implement, toward a violent criminal who’s a threat to the public.” What about the money?The FTX bankruptcy case is ongoing in the District of Delaware, where debtors have submitted a possible plan to repay users based on prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. Judge Kaplan also handed down an $11-billion forfeiture judgment as part of Bankman-Fried’s criminal case. “This forfeiture is designed to make certain that if SBF ever makes money, it goes not to him but to the government and the victims,” said former federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner, according to a March 29 CNN report. “He will never be able to accumulate funds in his life, and forfeiture cannot be eliminated through bankruptcy.” Epner’s statement suggested that should Bankman-Fried start a successful business making millions of dollars after his release, the government could go after these funds. The same could apply to a sudden windfall, making it less likely SBF will ever achieve the same financial status he had before November 2022.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

                        Solana Price PredictionSolana price is riding a wave of upward momentum, nearly touching the $200 mark with its current steady stance in the $180-$190 bracket. The 60% monthly surge in SOL’s price is partly driven by the buzz around meme coins such as Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, SLERF, and Book of Meme (BOME), spotlighting the Solana network and sparking robust investment flows. Concurrently, Solana’s DeFi sector growth and ecosystem solidity are bolstering investor trust, encouraging long-term holding over quick profit-taking in anticipation of further gains.Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem Thrives, Pushing TVL Near $5 Billion
Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is thriving, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $5 billion, a peak not seen since February 2022.This growth highlights the rising confidence and engagement in Solana’s DeFi platforms, reflecting a robust trust in its financial ecosystem.
Solana’s DeFi TVL’s surge to almost $5 billion underlines increased investment.
Despite market fluctuations, the growing TVL indicates sustained investor interest in Solana’s DeFi.
This uptrend suggests potential long-term value growth for Solana’s native token, SOL, as it becomes a preferred choice for DeFi activities.

Litecoin Price Spikes After CFTC Calls It Commodity Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt

Meme coin lovers may be having a great month, but Litecoin (LTC) hodlers are celebrating today with their coin taking the spot as the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a bullish performance in the last 24 hours that saw its price spike nearly 11%.This comes on the fifth day of relatively slow markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting by less than 2% in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today sits at $2.79 trillion, marking a mere -0.1% change in the last 24 hours.The most significant non-technical event contributing to Litecoin's spike is a recent statement by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, the CFTC declared Litecoin a commodity. This statement is crucial as it places Litecoin outside the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities and imposes stricter responsibilities on coin issuers.“KuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),” the complaint reads.Being declared a commodity potentially opens the door for more comfortable endorsements and further integrations for Litecoin, with less fear of the SEC attempting enforcement actions.Litecoin started the day at $94.80 and traded sideways until 6am UTC, when bulls took over the markets and spiked the coin to its daily high of $106 before correcting slightly to its current mark of $104.99. The coin is up 11.56% in the last 24 hours and 21.71% in the last week, plus 27.5% in the last 30 days. Friday marks the second best performing day of the year for LTC, only behind an 18.7% spike on March 11.On the technical side, Litecoin was trading sideways during January and February, bouncing in a horizontal channel between $63 and $77. The coin broke its channel on February 29 and started a bullish trend on March 1. Most of the positive performance registered in 2024 has been due to March's positive results. Since the bottom of the channel to today's high, there has been a roughly 63% spike.Image: TradingviewPast data shows that many of the unusually large candlesticks are followed by a correction of many small-bodied candlesticks in the days after. Litecoin failed to break past the resistance set by March 11's spike, which could point to a possible cup-and-handle pattern: A big spike followed by a symmetrical period of a correction, and a recovery that cancels all the losses almost in a semi-circle shape. If this is the case, there should be a smaller correction followed by a similar recovery before a bullish breakout.Overall, the coin looks bullish and healthy in a longer timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the coin is slightly overbought with a 66% dominance of bulls over bears, with Litecoin proving its bullishness after bouncing from its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 55 and going back again to trade on top of the EMA 10.Image: TradingviewGiven that the coin is bullish in charts set at 24 hour candlesticks and in weekly candlesticks for the first time since June of 2023, an immediate resistance could be around $115 for a 10% gain. If it remains strongly bullish, the next one appears to be near $135 for a nearly 29% gain. However, if it fails to meet expectations and corrects down, it could drop somewhere near the $80 price line for a -22.5% loss.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Ethereum Founder Thinks Meme Coins Can Be More Than Fun, Simple Tokens


																Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, believes meme coins can become higher quality projects that contribute positively to the crypto ecosystem and the world around them, squashing the narrative that such tokens are useless, racist, and sexist.
According to a new report titled “What Else Could Meme Coins Be?,” Buterin looks forward to seeing meme coin projects that support public goods instead of enriching insiders and creators. He urged creators to make games instead of just tokens.
Meme Coins Can Be More
The Ethereum founder cited a report he wrote ten years ago and published on Bitcoin Magazine, which addressed the role cryptocurrencies could play in funding important public projects like cancer research and saving the environment. He explained at the time that society needed new ways to fund valuable large-scale projects other than markets and institutions, and issuing new coins could fill in the gaps.
People who wanted to support cancer research could hold and trade AntiCancerCoin, while those passionate about saving the environment could use ClimateCoin. These assets would determine which projects get funded, creating long-lasting and positive tokens that are different from what meme coins have become today.
Buterin explained that people participate in meme coin projects because they feel they are democratic and open for anyone, they are fun, and the value of the tokens may increase. He suggested that the crypto community could use a large percentage of a meme coin’s supply to support valuable public causes, but that could happen at the expense of the token’s worth and democracy.




So, the remedy would be to create gaming projects that are democratic, meaningful, fun, and have the tendency to rise in value.
“Don’t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don’t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain,” the Ethereum founder stated.
Creating Interesting Games
Furthermore, the computer programmer insisted that if the goal of creating meme coins and related games is to satisfy people’s desire to have fun, then developers should stop making simple copy-and-paste coins. He urged owners of these projects to make the games more complicated and interesting.
Using blockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity as an example, Buterin commended how well the entity had improved the quality of its projects since its boom in 2021.

Tesla and Two Other Stocks Trading at 52-Week Lows that Can Rebound Strongly - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for one of the largest fraudulent financial schemes. When the FTX exchange collapsed at the end of 2022, he generated enormous fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), crashing the entire crypto market.



At times like that, investors make fortunes. Those stuck to their fundamental analysis bought Bitcoin and altcoins at steep discounts. That decision positioned them to have over 4x gains in the present. 



Similarly, certain stocks have had a suppressed price, leading to near 52-week lows. Which stocks tick the fundamental box but are yet to rebound?



Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



For the last 52 weeks, Tesla’s average stock price settled at $222.78 per share. This is 46% lower than TSLA’s all-time high of $409 in November 2021. Presently at $175, TSLA shares have gone down nearly 30% year-to-date, with another downward spike looking to revisit the yearly low of $153 per share.



There are many reasons to be both bullish and bearish. On one hand, TSLA stock has a higher market cap than Toyota (TM) and Ford Motor (F) combined. This suggests that investors are betting on the future of EVs rather than the present production of cars. 



Moreover, after acquiring Twitter for $44 billion, Elon Musk exposed himself to political vulnerability as the only major social media platform not controlled by the total state. Investors could also say that Tesla’s position in China continues to erode amid multiple EV newcomers like Li Auto.



On the other hand, it remains true that no Western EV company managed to popularize EVs as much as Tesla. More importantly, to scale EV production and lithium battery supply chain and gather data for self-driving capability. After all, Tesla’s EV dominance is demonstrated by the company’s charging standardization, becoming the North American Charging Standard (NACS).



Although EV adoption faces affordability hurdles and resale value, Tesla’s codenamed “Redwood” in 2025, at $25,000, will be a major milestone. Likewise, there is no sign that governments’ push towards a net-zero agenda is waning. Ahead of this inevitability, Tesla increased its year-over-year cash flow by 45% in Q4 2023, to $2 billion. 



Twelve months ahead, 32 analysts pulled by Nasdaq view the average TSLA price target at $198.72 vs the current $175 per share.





Philip Morris International (NASDAQ: PM)



For the last 52 weeks, the average Philip Morris (PM) stock price has been $94.04 per share. This is 5% lower than PM’s all-time high of $99.04 in February 2022. Presently, at $91.62, it is 4.8% from its yearly low of $87.23.



This is a stable range, which is not surprising given PM’s status as both a wide-moat and dividend stock. Even though the company is shifting to smokeless products, Philip Morris can still tap into a recurrent revenue stream of 1.3 billion global smokers. Much like Nvidia dominates the data center supply for generative AI, Philip Morris has an international market hold of 28%.



Given new investments to follow new smokeless trends, in the 2023 annual report, the company reported a 14.8% decline in operating cash flow to $9.2 billion. However, its earnings per share and operating net income have increased at 11% and 3.7%, respectively. 



Philip Morris offers a 5.68% dividend yield at a $5.20 per share annual payout. Twelve months ahead, 16 analysts pulled by Nasdaq position the average PM price target at $101.94 vs the current $91.62 per share.







GameStop Corporation (NASDAQ: GME)



Following the successful launch of Reddit (RDDT), there has been a resurgence of memetic energy. Thanks to social media coordination, the gaming retail chain was the main beneficiary of the trading phenomenon, alongside AMC Entertainment and other minor stocks. 



For the last 52 weeks, the average GameStop (GME) share price has been $17.89. This is 30% lower than its present price of $12.52 but very close to its 52-week low of $11.82. The company delivered mixed results on GameStop’s road toward a digital marketplace.



On Tuesday, GameStop’s Q4 2023 earnings report revealed a $6.7 million net income for the full year, significantly improving from the $313.1 million net loss in 2022. However, GameStop’s net sales are down 19% from the year prior at $1.8 billion. As a result, its earnings per share failed to beat the consensus of $0.25 at $0.22 reported.



Yet, the weekly dip of 9% may invite meme traders to elevate GME above the yearly low. Unlike the other two stocks, GME is on the pumpamentals spectrum rather than fundamentals for now.



What is your preferred vehicle for asset speculation, such as altcoins without earnings or meme stocks? Let us know in the comments below.

Why the Bitcoin Price Should Reach $150,000 by 2025, Explains Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
In an appearance on CNBC’s “Fast Money” on March 28, Mark Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency market. 



Yusko’s forecast for Bitcoin is notably bullish, predicting a potential rise to $150,000 within the next year. This projection is underpinned by a mathematical model that applies Metcalfe’s Law to determine a fair current value of around $50,000 for Bitcoin. With the imminent halving event (expected around April 20, 2024), which will reduce the reward for mining new blocks, Yusko anticipates an adjustment in Bitcoin’s fair value. He says that unique to this cycle is the additional transaction fees from ordinals and inscriptions, suggesting a post-halving fair value adjustment to $75,000. Yusko believes that historical patterns post-halving indicate a surge in interest and investment, potentially driving the price to double its fair value, culminating in the $150,000 target.



According to a report by The Daily Hodl, he said:



“So we look at the fair value today from the Metcalfe’s Law model… that gives us around $50,000. The halving occurs in three weeks. What a halving does is it cuts the block rewards, the amount of money that’s given to the miners to secure the network. If those rewards were to get cut in half, as they do, many of the miners would struggle. So historically what has happened? The price rises, the fair value rises. So that would push it to $100,000.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

“But this time it’s a little different in that instead of just block rewards, we get transaction fees because of ordinals and inscriptions. So let’s say the fair value only goes to $75,000 this time. Then post-halving you get a lot of interest in the asset, a lot of people FOMO (fear of missing out) in and we normally go to about two times fair value in the cycle … So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000.“



Yusko elaborates on the mechanics expected to fuel this price surge. According to Yusko, the upcoming halving will slash the daily supply of new coins from 900 to 450, concurrently with an anticipated increase in demand, partially driven by the US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. This imbalance between supply and demand is projected to escalate the price. Yusko envisions a more exponential growth towards the end of the year, with historical trends suggesting a peak around nine months post-halving, likely aligning with the holiday season.



While Bitcoin remains the focal point of Yusko’s analysis, he also delves into other aspects of the crypto ecosystem. He mentions the impact of regulatory challenges on the market and highlights his interest in mining companies and chip makers like AMD and Nvidia. Despite high valuations in these areas, Yusko sees significant potential.



At Morgan Creek Digital, the emphasis is on investing in private companies within the crypto sector, with liquid tokens comprising a smaller portion of their portfolio. Beyond Bitcoin, Yusko is optimistic about the prospects of Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among others. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance and its characterization as a superior form of digital gold, he believes in the exponential growth potential of smaller projects.



Yusko reveals Morgan Creek Digital’s approach to investment in the crypto space, aligning more with a venture capital model than active trading. Their strategy predominantly involves long-term holding, though they strategically exit positions in response to specific developments, as seen in their handling of Solana and Coinbase stock.

Russia Plans to Enter PC Gaming Handheld Market

Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved plans to enter Russia into the PC gaming handheld market, which has had very good development and was started by the units, for example, Steam Deck.Putin’s directive sparks interestAt a recent session presided over by President Putin on the social-economic advancement of the Kaliningrad region, the meeting’s proceedings revealed that one of the OK’ed directives comprised the manufacture of “portable gaming devices and gaming consoles”. The instruction, secretly captured by the Telegraphic Team and published online, clearly implies Russia’s desire to explore the business of gaming devices. Translation programs do not translate that instruction immaculately. The software version of that instruction highlights the importation of the production of land-based and portable game consoles and the development of its operating system and cloud software through which the delivery of games and programs to users will be made.Premier Mishustin of the people has been responsible for planning the portable gaming device. Directly citing Kommersant’s News, VK, a Russian tech company, may fulfill the project. While the GS Group, a South Korean global company, is responsible for production, the devices in question could be created.The projected console is anticipated to carry its own operating system and cloud system instead, such as the Steam Deck and Steel OS. At the same time, Kommersant is skeptical about the actionability of this process because Russia’s market is not competent in manufacturing consoles like PlayStation or Xbox. As per the news, building such a machine from scratch gram could last for up to 10 years, according to the newspaper.Market dynamics and potentialThe news from Russia arrives in the wake of a significant boom in demand for PC gaming handhelds, which has been detected by the booming market driven by devices like Steam Deck. This is evident because the Zephyrus ROG from Asus and the Legion Go from Lenovo have already entered the scene, which has indeed given the competitive landscape of portable gaming a tough time to compete. Though the details are yet to be public, the plan for the device has an appeal that has given the market spectators something to discuss in the meantime.The option of Russia launching personal computers for handheld games in the market may claim another turf in a competitive and ever-dynamic industry. Discussions on the prospect of a hypothetical Microsoft handheld console by lead analysts such as Phil Spencer do not need explanations because it’s already obvious that the space for portable gaming is evolving rapidly. With mobile gamers always chasing the elusive gaming experience on a portable device, vendors strive to make the most of this demand. It is not clear whether the Russia-originated game will reach its goals. Still, no matter its result, the fact that Russia created it is a sign of new technological discovery in the expanding universe of digital gaming.As led by the Russian projects to gear up the development of the new gaming handheld, the category [of] portable games on the rise is tipped for more supplication. Competing in this global market is currently a challenge for companies that intend to penetrate these rapidly growing markets, and innovation and competition power the whole industry to move forward. Even though the hard part of the nature of the mission, its schedule, is unclear, one thing is for sure: the brewing rise of portable gaming devices fueled by serious investment. With the advancement of everyday processing capability, the means will be explored to see how the new kid on the block will print the future of handheld gaming.

Mixed reactions: Google's move into cryptocurrency monitoring

Google recently made a breakthrough by expanding its search capability to monitor wallet balances across various blockchains, thus enabling Google users to effortlessly track their cryptocurrencies using the search engine. The enhancement includes popular blockchains like Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Fantom and accommodates various cryptocurrency users. Google’s upgraded search capability enables such users to enter wallet addresses and receive a series of common search results showing the token balance per network, with a timestamp that indicates the time the data was last updated. The development eliminates the need for the user to navigate across multiple platforms to monitor their cryptocurrencies, thus lowering the barrier and streamlining the transaction of digital assets.Moreover, Google’s updated search feature supports three Bitcoin address formats: P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32. As discussed earlier in this post, this development allows users to quickly check the current balance and recent transactions for Bitcoin addresses from Google, further simplifying the monitoring of Bitcoin activity from within the Google platform. On the one hand, the initiative was met with praise, with some commentators arguing that it is an essential step forward in assimilating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the broader user experience. On the other hand, several concerns about massive, centralized data collection continued to be voiced, especially among privacy-focused Bitcoin proponents.Google’s evolution in embracing cryptocurrenciesGoogle’s development of such cryptocurrency-related products represents a significant shift from the platform’s earlier disclosure of digital assets. For instance, in 2018, the platform explicitly banned advertising anything related to Bitcoins. Nonetheless, following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States in November of that year, Google displayed advertisements for ETF products from major asset managers like BlackRock. More strategically, Google discerned a cooperation agreement with Coinbase in October 2022 and publicized that the company’s customers may pay for Google Cloud facilities using cryptocurrencies.Support for Ethereum and DeFiSupport for Ethereum and DeFi Google’s recent growth is in line with its launch of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain search results, which simplifies the process for users to keep track of their Ethereum holdings by allowing them to check wallet balances using readable domain names like “vitalik.eth.” Additionally, Google Cloud partnered with Web3 startup Orderly Network in 2023 to create user-centric developer tools for Decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing long-standing entry barriers and security concerns within the DeFi ecosystem. This partnership demonstrates Google’s dedication to aiding creative initiatives in the cryptocurrency space.

Dogwifhat climbs to third in memecoin market cap


Dogwifhat (WIF), a memecoin based on the Solana blockchain, has claimed the third spot in market capitalization rankings among memecoins.
WIF now has a market cap of US$4 billion, trailing Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, valued at over US$30 billion and US$18 billion, respectively.
WIF traded at US$4.13 at 2:45 p.m. ET, a record high, according to CoinGecko data. 
WIF took the frog-themed currency Pepe’s position to rank third among memecoins, making the top three slots now occupied by dog-themed projects.



Memecoins as a category saw a 27% increase over the past week, with Dogwifhat recording an 84% surge in this timeframe.
However, the meme frenzy is not without its risks, as highlighted by the recent spike in presale scams on the Solana blockchain. 
Crypto detective ZachXBT has brought attention to several presale coins that have raised red flags for potential fraudulent activities.

BNB’s 12% weekly surge: peaking or just getting started?

BNB (BNB) saw a 12% increase in value over the seven days leading up to March 29, reaching a nearly two-week high of $620. This surge narrowed the valuation gap with its main competitor, Ether (ETH), which posted a 5% gain during the same timeframe. However, mixed signals from on-chain BNB Chain data suggest that the rally may have stretched too far.Impact from spot Bitcoin ETF flows and DeFi momentum on BNB’s priceMarket analysts note that the cryptocurrency market’s upward trend is closely linked to inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which experienced a setback in the week ending March 23. For the first time since the introduction of spot ETFs in January, these financial instruments saw a net outflow of $890 million. On a positive note, recent figures indicate a significant decrease in outflows from Grayscale GBTC fund, with only $104 million leaving the fund on March 28.In the first half of March, BNB’s price soared by 61.7%, but this momentum reversed after reaching a peak of $645, corresponding to a market capitalization of $96.4 billion. For context, BNB hit an all-time high valuation of $116 billion in November 2021. Interestingly, the total value locked (TVL) on BNB Chain, which represents the total deposits in the network’s smart contracts, was $15.7 billion at that peak but has since fallen to just $7.1 billion, a 55% reduction.It's important to recognize that the entire crypto market, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi), has contracted significantly since late 2021. Therefore, it’s somewhat unfair to single out the decline in BNB Chain’s TVL. For example, the total market data for all blockchains tracked by DefiLlama, which once reached nearly $205 billion, now stands at $155 billion, marking a 25% decrease.Hence, a detailed examination of BNB Chain’s TVL, especially in comparison with direct competitors like Ethereum and Solana (SOL), is warranted. BNB Chain’s smart contract deposits have fallen to their lowest since March 2021, down 10% over two months, in stark contrast to Ethereum’s 8% TVL increase in ETH terms and Solana’s TVL, which jumped 29% since Jan. 28, as reported by DefiLlama.BNB Chain’s activity looks promisingTVL should not be the sole indicator of a blockchain’s success. Many decentralized applications (DApps), including nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, games, decentralized bets, collectibles, and social networks, do not require substantial deposits. In the past week alone, nearly 2 million active addresses were engaging with DApps on the BNB Chain.Top blockchains ranked by 7-day DApps volume. Source: DappRadarBNB Chain’s activity levels rival those of Ethereum’s most active layer-2 networks, boasting a comparable number of active addresses. Notably, despite Solana’s active addresses being 14% higher during the same timeframe, no blockchain other than Ethereum approaches the seven-day trading volume of BNB Chain, which stands at $12.4 billion. Moreover, while Solana and Ethereum saw their volumes decrease, BNB Chain's trading volume experienced an 11% uptick.Forecasting future trends in the cryptocurrency sector presents considerable challenges. A more reliable approach involves examining derivative metrics, such as the demand for leverage in BNB perpetual futures contracts, which serves as an indicator of market demand. A key metric to consider is the funding rate: a positive funding rate indicates a tendency among traders to apply leverage to their long positions.Related: Bitcoin to attract $1T from institutions amid ‘raging bull market’ — Bitwise execBNB perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinglassThe latest figures show that the demand for leveraged long positions has leveled off, with the 8-hour funding rate holding steady at around 0.03%, or about 0.6% weekly. Usually, when traders feel positive about the market, this rate can climb above 1.2% per week. So, despite BNB’s price struggle with the $620 level, market sentiment remains optimistic.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Vitalik Buterin Sees Value in Meme Coins: Looking Past the Hype - DailyCoin


        
Meme coins have held user appeal for fun and community despite their volatility and criticism.



Vitalik Buterin has explored the possibility of “good meme coins” that contribute positively to causes.



Buterin has suggested a more critical approach for users to find meme coins aligned with their values.
The cryptocurrency space continues to be a hotbed of innovation, with new projects and trends emerging constantly. One such trend, meme coins, has garnered significant attention in recent years, with Dogecoin’s meteoric rise in 2021 being a prime example. Can Meme Coins Be Good for Crypto?These meme coins, often inspired by internet jokes and featuring little to no underlying utility, have also faced criticism for their volatility, lack of innovation, and even offensive content. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain network, has finally shared his thoughts on the ongoing meme coin frenzy. While acknowledging the potential downsides, Buterin also recognizes the appeal of meme coins. He highlights the “fun” aspect that attracts users and the sense of community and accessibility they often provide. Buterin doesn’t shy away from the negative aspects. 
He points to the prevalence of “rug pulls,” where developers abandon a project after an initial pump in price, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Additionally, some recent meme coins on the Solana network have been slammed for containing offensive content.However, Buterin doesn’t advocate simply dismissing the entire meme coin phenomenon.  Instead, he ponders the possibility of “good meme coins” that contribute positively to the ecosystem. He cites examples like “GiveWell Inu,” which donated to a charity evaluator, and “Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,” which supports anti-aging research projects.  Vitalik Buterin on Value and CommunityEven the highly popular Dogelon Mars falls into this category, with Buterin’s own donation to a longevity research foundation fostering a strong connection between the two communities. Buterin acknowledges the limitations of charitable meme coins.
The core appeal of meme coins lies in potential price appreciation, accessibility, and entertainment value. Donating a large portion of a coin’s supply to charity could undermine these factors.Looking forward, Buterin suggests a more nuanced approach. He encourages users to find meme coin communities that align with their values and personalize their experience within the meme coin space. This, he argues, proves more effective than a blanket rejection of the entire trend, which may push people away and hinder the potential for positive change.On the Flipside
Social media hype and celebrity endorsements can inflate meme coin prices, creating bubbles vulnerable to crashes and hurting investors.



Rug pulls and other scams are unfortunately common in the meme coin space, leading to significant investor losses.
Why This MattersVitalik Buterin’s balanced perspective on meme coins offers a crucial step towards responsible participation in this sector. By acknowledging their fun, social aspects while highlighting potential pitfalls and advocating for impactful projects, Buterin encourages users to navigate the meme coin space critically.Interested in the impact of Ethereum reaching 1 million validators?

Bitcoin Cash Up 55%: What's Behind Unlikely Comeback? - DailyCoin


        
Bitcoin Cash surges in price.



Several factors are behind the renewed interest.



Roger Ver maintains that BCH is the true Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was on the brink of obscurity, steadily dropping in the crypto market cap rankings. But a remarkable turnaround began in mid-February, culminating in a staggering 55% gain over the past week. This surge has propelled BCH to a 123-week high, sparking renewed interest and speculation about its future.A Perfect Storm For Bitcoin CashBitcoin Cash has triggered renewed interest in recent weeks thanks to various factors, including the upcoming halving scheduled for April 3. This event will cut the current 6.25 BCH block reward to 3.125 BCH, reducing the new token issuance to impact supply dynamics. Halvings are generally seen as bullish drivers, with BCH’s recent boom likely due to pre-halving buying in anticipation of future price increases.Further stoking BCH interest is the scheduled launch of Bitcoin Cash futures contracts on Coinbase. Set for launch on April 1, this product will allow investors to speculate on BCH’s future price movements using leverage. 
Beyond investor sentiment, BCH’s underlying fundamentals are also strengthening. The network hash rate, which reflects the computing power underpinning the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, surged to 6.33 ETH/s on March 28, more than tripling from March 4’s 2.08 EH/s hash rate, suggesting miners have confidence in the network’s long-term viability.With confidence in Bitcoin Cash returning, Roger Ver has rekindled the debate on whether BCH is a more faithful representation of Bitcoin, as outlined in the whitepaper.Bitcoin Has Been Captured: VerWith Bitcoin Cash back in contention, Ver re-ignited the long-running rivalry with Bitcoin in a recent interview, saying BTC does not align with cypherpunk philosophy, nor is it anything like the system described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper. 
Ver stated that in the early days of Bitcoin, he promoted self-sovereign principles such as “taxation is theft, and you should have control of your own money,” which he continues to believe in and promote to this day.However, taking BTC maximalist Michael Saylor as an example, Ver underscored the ideological divide between BCH and BTC by criticizing Saylor’s advocacy of compliance, which Ver sees as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s initial rebellious spirit.“We have Michael Saylor saying pay your taxes; we’re not going to replace the US dollar or euro. Just be a good boy and obey everything the government tells you to do, which is the exact opposite of the early days of Bitcoin,” stated Ver. BCH is better positioned to fulfill the original concept envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, according to Ver. On the Flipside
There is a growing narrative that BCH is the solution to CBDCs and state surveillance. 



With Craig Wright outed as not Satoshi Nakamoto and BSV’s future uncertain, the door opens for BCH to become the dominant peer-to-peer Bitcoin token.



BCH is down 98% against BTC since its ATH of 0.433 in November 2017.
Why This MattersBitcoin Cash’s resurgence reignites the debate on cryptocurrency’s core purpose, which BCH proponents see as upholding cypherpunk ideals and freeing individuals from centralized control. In contrast, BTC is heading towards compliance, setting a battleground for the future direction of digital assets. Read about allegations Roger Ver caused the collapse of CoinFLEX here:CoinFLEX Says Bitcoin Jesus’ $47 Million Loan Default Is Behind Withdrawal TroublesFind out why the UK High Court ordered a freeze on Craig Wright’s global assets here:Craig Wright Asset Freeze: Why UK Court Took Drastic Action

$236,000,000,000 in 'Improper Payments' Made by US Government in One Year, Exposing Material Weakness in Internal Controls: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The US government is botching hundreds of billions of dollars of payments per year, according to a new report.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says federal agencies made $236 billion in “improper payments” last year – a number that includes overpayments, inaccurate recordkeeping and fraud.










The agency says the wasteful and erroneous spending is a systemic issue showing a serious weakness in how the government manages money.
“Improper payments—those that should not have been made or were made in the incorrect amount—have consistently been a government-wide issue…
GAO has found that these payments represent a material deficiency or weakness in internal controls. 
Specifically, GAO has noted that the federal government is unable to determine the full extent of its improper payments or to reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken to reduce them.”
Overpayments are the biggest issue by far, clocking in at $175.1 billion, followed by “unknown payments” at $44.6 billion.
Source: Government Accountability Office
The GAO says last year’s number represents an $11 billion decrease compared to 2022.
The agency has been tracking improper payments for 20 years and says the government has mishandled a staggering $2.7 trillion in payments in that time.
In 2023, 14 agencies reported improper payment estimates across 71 programs, with 79% of estimated improper payments concentrated in five areas:
• HHS’s Medicare, comprising three programs ($51 billion)
• HHS’s Medicaid ($50 billion)
• Department of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance – Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ($44 billion)
• Department of the Treasury’s Earned Income Tax Credit ($22 billion)
• Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program Loan Forgiveness ($19 billion)

Dogecoin Influencer Predicts When DOGE Payments Will Debut On X | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin influencer, Mishaboar has predicted the timeline for Dogecoin’s native token, DOGE to be integrated into Elon Musk’s X Payments. The developer has highlighted key phases and plans that must be accomplished before cryptocurrency payments are potentially added on X.  
Developer Forecasts Dogecoin in X Payments Within 5 Years
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post released on Thursday, March 28, Mishaboar forecasted the introduction of Dogecoin into X Payments in the coming years. The developer anticipates that Dogecoin payments could be potentially introduced into X within five years.

During discussions about forthcoming developments set for X Payments, Mishaboar addressed a member of the crypto community who suggested that the implementation of crypto payments into X may take up to five years. Countering the statement, Mishaboar expressed anticipation for the integration of crypto payments on X  “much earlier than that.” 
The Dogecoin developer has anchored his predictions on the growing adoption and approval of cryptocurrencies in global payment systems. According to Mishaboar, world-leading payment services like PayPal are already supporting cryptocurrencies, suggesting a strong possibility for X payments to follow suit and integrate cryptocurrencies in the near future. 
In projecting DOGE payments on X before five years, Mishaboar has also tempered expectations by predicting that the integration is unlikely to occur as early as next year. While these forecasts have further piqued the heightened anticipation within the crypto community, it’s important to note that they remain speculative. No official statements have been issued by Musk confirming the integration of Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency into X Payments. 
Key Developmental Phases Set For X Payments
In his post, Mishaboar revealed that there were still several developments planned for X Payments before the project launches officially. The developer underscored a statement made by Musk last year, in which the SpaceX CEO indicated that the first phase of X Payments would focus on introducing fiat currencies, rather than cryptocurrencies. 

The crypto developer has stated that potentially introducing cryptocurrency into X Payments would be a step-by-step process, emphasizing the importance of obtaining key licenses and meeting regulatory requirements before launching a payments service on X.  
Recently, Musk disclosed that X Payments had secured money transmitter licenses across three regions in the United States. The Tesla CEO has noted that X is getting closer to winning another money transmitter license in California. Achieving this milestone would mark another significant step towards advancing the potential launch of X Payments.

SHIB's 10% surge: Can Shiba Inu flip AVAX to enter top 10 again? - AMBCrypto



If SHIB follows the same trend from the 1st of March, it could become number 10.
The sentiment around AVAX was negative compared to SHIB’s optimistic state.

Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] return to the top 10 fold might be closer if the token keeps up with its seven-day momentum. As of this writing, SHIB was 11th on the standings.
But a 10.36% hike within the last week suggested that SHIB can flip Avalanche’s [AVAX] $20.3 billion market cap.
Is it over for the red chain?
For AVAX, it has not been able to attract the same goodwill as Shiba Inu. When SHIB’s price increased, AMBCrypto observed that AVAX could not match up as its value fell by 3.35%.
However, price is not the only indicator suggesting a possible flipping. According to our analysis, other metrics like the Weighted Sentiment and Social Dominance implied the same.
At press time, on-chain data from Santiment showed that SHIB’s Social Dominance had increased to 1.675%. Evidence showed that a rising Social Dominance comes with a further price increase for the memecoin.
For example,  the metric started rising on the 1st of March. A few days later, it hit a month-long high, and it was around the same period that SHIB climbed to $0.000040.
Source: Santiment
If this trend repeats itself, then the price of Shiba Inu could increase. Should this be the case, the value could sustain an uptrend that sends it toward $0.000037.
Bulls think it’s SHIB’s time
SHIB’s Weighted Sentiment data showed a divergence from that of AVAX’s. The metric assesses the overall mood of the market toward a cryptocurrency.
At press time, SHIB’s sentiment had climbed to 0.586, indicating that market participants were bullish on the token. However, the reading was not at the greed level that could imply a potential reversal.
Therefore, a further price increase could be a reasonable option. In AVAX’s case, it was not the same, as the sentiment remained negative. A situation like this suggests that participants have pessimistic comments about the price action.
Hence, demand for the token might reduce which could also mean a price decline. If this trend with Shiba Inu and AVAX continues over the next few days, then SHIB might displace the latter from the 10th position.
Source: Santiment
However, AVAX might resist the flipping if fear gets extreme as this could fuel a rally for the token. Should the rally come before SHIB takes over the position, the aforementioned prediction could be invalidated.

Realistic or not, here’s SHIB’s market cap in AVAX terms

In addition, market participants might need to watch out for the buzzing narrative in the market. As of this writing, memecoins outperformed most of the top altcoins.
If this remains the same, the flipping might happen. However, if altcoins start to run, the projects might maintain their respective positions.

AI Revolutionizing Healthcare: Addressing Data Ambiguity | Cryptopolitan

The field of healthcare has been undergoing great changes with AI. AI promises to shorten the time and be more precise in the diagnosis, to bring customized treatment and achieve better patient outcomes. A Harvard School of Public Health report ascertains that AI can cut down treatment costs by up to 50% and boost health outcomes by as much as 40%. Hospital administrative frameworks can also be streamlined by AI, which serves as a bedside cheerful nurse throughout. AI’s health capabilities depend on the quality of their input data.Understanding data ambiguityData ambiguity presents problems such as uncertainties, incompleteness, or inconsistency in medical data that AI utilization and integration face. Data errors resulting from data collection or processing may imply an inaccurate decision or misunderstanding by AI algorithms when diagnosing or suggesting a treatment. However, if left misdiagnosing or misdirecting the treatment.The results of that are not only in healthcare but overall. Errors in diagnostics, which mainly result from interpretations by AI based on inadequate data, may slow down the application of necessary and correct treatments, thus threatening patient safety. Errors that arise from flawed or missing data in the care given can easily lead to a much worse reaction such as a serious treatment that will not heal the patient. Data ambiguity can simultaneously result in ethical and legal issues, which can adversely affect trust, possibly towards healthcare services and institutions.Addressing challengesTo identify solutions for the problem, an integrated strategy on meteorological data ambiguity is essential. It further means enhancing the data quality by applying strict collection and processing procedures and verifying the AI systems to let them work efficiently and accurately. All this will help build a framework of effective regulation and the rule of law, promoting patients’ sensitivity and transparency.Several programs and factions go into solving these difficulties. Cutting-edge data analytics techniques, both NLP (natural language processing) and AI (Artificial intelligence), are being used to explore relevant nuggets from diverse data sources and improve how doctors diagnose diseases and foresee patients’ treatments. FHIR may be just one of the many standardization efforts in this regard, and its objective will be to make data interoperability and sharing possible, breaking the barriers to AI integration.Transparent AI modelsCreating algorithms that provide clarity and will be accessible to healthcare practitioners and their patients is a key priority in this area. Instead, AI models serve as tools for clinical decision-makers to validate and explain AI-generated recommendations and enable complex reasoning that couldn’t be accomplished before.With the healthcare AI uprising becoming more real and apparent, the main concern is data ambiguity resolution, which holds the key to the full potential of AI in healthcare. Through data quality enhancement, AI system validation, and strong regulations and governance regulation, the healthcare sector can take advantage of all the AI power while protecting the patients from hazards, privacy, and others. On the back of teamwork and progressive advances, health care finds a bright future ahead of it, blazed by the trail of AI.

BlockDAG Puts Bitcoin Minetrix to Rest With Its $10.4M Presale Haul: Analysing MEMEAI Price Prediction for April 2024



                    
The crypto market is back up, with most major altcoins up on daily, monthly, and yearly charts. Not surprisingly, meme coins are leading the pack, with MEMEAI up by a staggering 1113.16% over the past month. MEMEAI price predictions suggest a continuation of the positive uptrend with a potential 226.39% rise by the end of April.



In the ICO market, BlockDAG (BDAG) and Bitcoin Minetrix presales are on the frontlines, dominating investor attention with highly successful presales and compelling 5000X ROI projections.




Bitcoin Minetrix Presale: An Innovation in DeFi



Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) presents an innovative decentralised platform for Bitcoin mining, eliminating the need for heavy energy consumption and expensive mining equipment.





By staking BTCMTX tokens, users gain mining credits that grant access to cloud mining hash power, offering an easy and accessible way to dive into Bitcoin mining. This inventive approach to BTC mining has captured significant interest, evidenced by a rapid sellout of the  Bitcoin Minetrix presale.



MEMEAI Price Prediction



Meme AI (MEMEAI) rose by a staggering 1113.16% over the past month, and the current Meme AI price prediction for 2024 suggests a potential rise of 226.39%, reaching $0.024654 by April 26, 2024.




Despite this optimistic forecast, the current sentiment around MEMEAI is bearish. Seventy-five percent of technical analysis indicators suggest bearish signals, and only 25% show bullish signs. Furthermore, over the last thirty days, Meme AI Coin had only 33% green days, showcasing considerable volatility.





BlockDAG – The Best Presale Crypto 2024



BlockDAG (BDAG) has firmly planted its flag in the crypto world after its keynote address debuted on the digital screens of Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing. The address announced the project’s ambitious goals for 2024: reaching $600 million in presale funding and securing a spot among the top 50 cryptos on ranking platforms like Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko. The announcement has significantly amplified the project’s visibility, attracting a wave of investments into its presale that has already surpassed $10.4 million.



BlockDAG is not just aiming to join the crypto elites’ ranks but positioning itself as a formidable rival to industry stalwarts such as Bitcoin, Helium, and Kaspa. With predictions of a staggering 5000X return, BlockDAG presents an enticing prospect for investors. Early adopters purchasing BDAG coins at the current price of $0.003 could see an ROI of approximately 1566% when the project launches at $0.05, showcasing its immense potential for profitability.



Beyond its investment appeal, BlockDAG is committed to democratising crypto mining, making it more accessible to the general public. To this end, the project introduces a range of mining solutions catering to different expertise levels. From its advanced X-series mining rigs designed for dedicated miners to its convenient cloud mining service for those looking to invest in mining without the hardware, BlockDAG is lowering the barriers to entry into the crypto mining space. Additionally, its mining app, available on both the Apple Store and Google Play, brings mining capabilities to a broader audience, allowing users to participate in the crypto economy directly from their smartphones.






In response to the overwhelming early investor interest and the $10.4 million raised quickly, BlockDAG, currently priced at $0.003 in the fifth batch, has announced a $2 million mega giveaway for 50 lucky community members. Investors can participate in the giveaway by following BlockDAG’s social media channels, submitting their wallet addresses, increasing their winning chances by completing all quests, and inviting friends for additional entries.



In Summary



Meme AI (MEMEAI) has experienced a remarkable rise of 1113.16% over the past month, with MEMEAI price predictions suggesting a further increase of 226.39% by April 26, 2024, despite a predominantly bearish sentiment and high volatility in its market.



In the presale market, Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) and BlockDAG (BDAG) quickly garner interest with their rapid presale sellout. The BlockDAG (BDAG) project is especially noteworthy, having raised a whopping $10.4M and projecting an ROI of 1566% at launch.

Hackers Loot Ethereum-Based DeFi Protocol Prisma Finance for $11,600,000 Worth of Crypto: PeckShield - The Daily Hodl


								Bad actors have exploited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Prisma Finance and stole 3,257.69 Ethereum (ETH) worth $11.6 million, according to PeckShield.
The blockchain security and analytics firm flagged the suspicious activity after the hacker initially siphoned $8.1 million worth of funds from the platform.










The attacker eventually distributed the stolen assets to three wallets.
The team behind Prisma Finance acknowledged the security breach and says it is taking measures to prevent further losses.
“Following the exploit affecting a number of users’ individual vaults, Prisma Protocol has been paused by the emergency multisig and remaining funds are safe. mkUSD and ULTRA, as stablecoins, are overcollateralized and are not at risk.
We will continue to communicate through our official channels and are working to resolve this situation.
Due to the recent exploit, Prisma urges all users to revoke all connections to prevent loss of funds.  All users who connected their wallets to the platform are at risk of future fund loss.”
Prisma Finance says it is now conducting an investigation and will attempt to retrieve the stolen funds. The platform also warns users to be cautious of scams.
“During the next hours, be careful with phishing links of all sort. Trust only official communication channels please.”

VC Roundup: Investors move into cross-chain, Bitcoin layer-2, and institutional tools

Venture capital firms are moving to seize market share amid the current bull cycle. March’s developments include the acquisition of a quantitative trading firm, CFT Capital, by Web3-native investment company Borderless Capital.The move adds artificial intelligence and quant proprietary trading products to Borderless' businesses, targeting more efficiency in capital deployment across Web3 verticals, said the company with $600 million in assets under management. Borderless is an early investor in Algorand, Blockchdaemon and Securitize — the latter of which is BlackRock's new partner in a tokenized digital fund. The acquisition will also place Borderless in Latin America. “We are currently actively looking for Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico,” Borderless’ co-founder and managing partner David Garcia told Cointelegraph.For 2024, the venture firm expects cross-chain standardization to be the next chapter in the evolution of the crypto space. “The advent of modularity in blockchains is a long-term trend, and we anticipate new L1s, L2s, and even L3s will emerge. [...] For mainstream adoption, we believe Web3 needs an aggregation layer that can interoperate across any chain,” Garcia said.According to Garcia, another key investment focus at Borderless is decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). “We strongly believe DePIN represents a new coordination and innovation paradigm across many diverse industries, including communication, distributed computation, mapping, and transportation.”In this edition of Cointelegraph’s VC Roundup, we feature startups that raised capital during the last weeks of March.Morph receives $20M in angel and seed fundingEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-2 Morph has raised $19 million in a seed round led by DragonFly Capital with additional participation from Pantera Capital, Foresight Ventures, The Spartan Group, MEXC Ventures, Symbolic Capital, Public Works, MH Ventures, Everyrealm. The firm raised an additional $1 million secured in an angel round. The company plans to use the capital toward talent acquisition, developer incentives, and marketing efforts. The blockchain is built on three pillars: decentralized sequencers, optimistic zkEVM integration, and modular design. “Being one of the first to launch with a decentralized sequencer on Ethereum is also an example of our commitment to decentralization from the beginning,” said Morph co-founder and chief operating officer Azeem Khan.FLock.io secures $6M seed round to decentralize AI trainingLondon-based Web3 decentralized AI startup FLock.io announced a $6 million Seed fundraising on March 28, co-led by Lightspeed Faction and Tagus Capital. The company aims to deploy its Federated Learning-powered Training Platform with the new funds, designed to decentralize AI agent training, fine-tuning, and inferencing while ending user data collection. “Now, anyone can contribute knowledge and enrich AI models themselves. The result? Community-owned models built by the many, not just the few, with data contributors being fairly rewarded and far more use cases,” said the startup in a statement. Source: FLock.ioKeyring Network raises $6M for digital assets compliance Keyring Network, founded by a former Nomura quant analyst and a J.P. Morgan investment banker in 2022, has secured $6 million in seed funding, co-led by gumi Cryptos Capital and Greenfield Capital, with additional support from Motier Ventures, Kima Ventures, UDHC Finance, Eberg Capital, and notable angel investors. The platform leverages zero-knowledge technology to address regulatory compliance and market liquidity for financial organizations, enabling private data sharing and identification of qualified participants for secondary market tokenized transactions. “Keyring’s asset-level solution is the most flexible ZK compliance tool catering to financial institutions’ individual DeFi risk appetite. Users can restrict themselves in terms of counterparty interactions, so they can be as conservative as they would like to,” noted Felix Machart, partner at Greenfield Capital. Rails secures $6.2M for self-custodial perpetuals exchangeCrypto perpetual exchange Rails has raised $6.2 million in a seed round led by Slow Ventures, Round13 Capital, CMCC Global, and Quantstamp. The exchange offers self-custody trading of perpetual contracts — a type of futures contract without an expiry date, allowing traders to better employ risk management strategies. The funds will be used to support the development of the platform, which uses smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs. Rails was created as a result of the FTX collapse, said its co-founder Satraj Bramba in a statement. “In addition to getting rugged on FTX, the harder pill to swallow was the loss of the most efficient, productive trading environment we had ever used. [...] This massive gap in the market led to the creation of Rails.” Build on Bitcoin raises $10M seed round led by Castle Island VenturesHybrid layer-2 solution BOB, or “Build on Bitcoin,” has successfully raised $10 million in a seed funding round led by Castle Island Ventures with contributions from Mechanism Ventures, Bankless Ventures, CMS Ventures, UTXO Management, Asymmetric, Antalpha, Web3.com Ventures, BTC Frontier Fund, and Zeeprime. The funds are earmarked for launching the first Bitcoin layer-2 with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, designed to stimulate the onboarding of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Bitcoin network. BOB has also formed a strategic partnership with Anduro, a project by Marathon Digital, to collaborate on Alys, a Bitcoin layer-2 solution for institutions.RACE unveils $5M raise amid testnet launchTokenization platform RACE has disclosed a $5 million funding raise aimed at supporting its recently released testnet. The platform offers tokenization of assets such as aircraft, real estate, private credits, art, jewelry, and gold to accredited and institutional investors. RACE plans to build Decentralized Investment Committees (DICs) composed of industry experts who will perform due diligence on assets, including underwriting, legal services, asset custodianship, and financial analysis.

Apex Legends Competitive Scene Undergoes Massive Shake-Up with Removal of Dropship and Introduction of POI Draft

Professional play in the Apex Legends competitive scene isn’t new to controversies, with the most recent hack events undoubtedly leaving a trail often behind. The game company Electronic Arts (EA) revealed recently envisioned serious amendments in action for Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) including the holding of the Dropship stage and the coming of Performance-Based POI Draft.The dropship departureEA took a decisive step to leave the Dropship mechanic in pro-game mode. The beginning of the match will consist of all teams appearing on the map at one of the 28 POIs, through either Skyfall or group spawn, instead of one team appearing from the sky at a time. This last turn from the tradition directs to drop randomness during Dropship lanes, so the cycle can be more controlled, keeping a strong strategy in match starts.Performance-based POI draftSimple but effective, this city revitalization plan heavily relies on the introduction of a Performance-Based POI Draft. It will be at the mercy of teams to spend the first-day draft doing the team landing locations in the Frontiers Cup and LAN events. This heptagonal political system will let teams draft by taking turns choosing their preference of positions (POI). This draft order must be given a performance-based weighting with LAN results and Regional Finals as criteria, thus ensuring that the best teams have an advantage in their final decisions regarding the pick order.Fairness and skill testingAccording to EA, the introduction of differentiation will bring about a level playing field and this type of fight will become a true test of skill for the fighters. In this way, the RNG factor that controls Drop shipping paths won’t count, and the skills of each player will be the resource to form a draft based on their performance. As a result, the competition is now more predictable and can be strategic. Moreover, EA will coordinate the draft with sporting sides as it is going to be held few weeks before the start of competitions to let sides choose their preferred POI and get enough time for practice.Implications for competitive playThe revelation of these changes has significantly impacted the community of Apex Legends, thereby generating talks over the possible effects that involve competitive strategies and team dynamics. However, the lack of the Dropship will force diverse adaptations, and remember to read carefully the map. It should also be noted that the incorporation of the POI draft system adds an extra level of complexity, which now demands from the teams a lot of thinking before they make their selection of the options based on the strengths and objectives.Rollout and community responseEA has scheduled the release of these changes alongside the July 2 Regular Season of the ALGS Year 4 Pro League. The community is now excited as these amendments are about to be completed to see what the competitive field will be. Though some of the players and teams would look at the evolution of the game as the chance for some cognitive revolution, others would rather look at it as the phase of difficulty and adaptation.A new Apex Legends competitive play season commencing soon will feature breaks from the past standards, as a Dropship is taken away and an advanced POI Draft system by Performance is introduced. As EA strives to build a more regulated and organized environment for intense gaming, the enthusiasts along with all the community members are impatiently waiting for the rollout of the changes and their actual effect on ALGS. The possibility of transforming the tactical, strategic, and skills-testing nature of Apex Legends eSports takes place and a new era in eSports is coming.

Revolutionizing Web Development: ChatGPT's "Screenshot to Code" Feature

One important step towards improving web development, OpenAI ChatGPT, is introducing a new approach, “Screenshot to Code, ” which can be implemented within the ChatGPT app store environment. This add-on has attracted considerable attention among the community of web designers who can now convert screenshots into executable code such as HTML and CSS.Streamlining Web developmentThe “Screenshot to Code” capability simplifies the web development process, especially for newbies in this field, where they can bookmark and open later with just one click, saving them time once they have enough skills and experience. The tool can be accessed more intuitively than before by navigating ChatGPT. Still, directly within it, users can upload a screenshot of the website layout they want to see a certain webpage coded and then start the process through the available tool in the GPT shop. Though the AI-powered mechanism is responsible for analyzing visual data, a quick generation of HTML and CSS code is also attributed.Automating the role “of ‘Screenshot to Code” streamlines the development process and makes it more accurate and effective, creating an end-product that satisfies the end-users. These simple and easy-to-understand steps enable individuals to concentrate on web design’s artistic or aesthetic traits so that they don’t have to worry about technical complexities, which ChatGPT can succinctly handle. The coded templates are uniquely suited to work with popular website builder applications from WordPress. This makes website building and on-the-go updating even more straightforward.Unleashing creative expressionThe easy implementation of this code enabled tailors without any prerequisite programming knowledge to take their creations professionally, thus bypassing the complex coding language learning curve. This innovation offers to express yourself and makes web innovation possible by creating a work environment that is open to all and easy for all to realize. Creating a screenshot from code symbolizes screenshot-to-code transcendence in a way humans have never experienced, which means digital technologies can be friendlier to users by including more options and making them more accessible.Alternatively, the ‘Screenshot to Code’ feature could be the most imaginative approach to tackle the complex issues of web development, but sometimes the consequences for the future are not sure. Although the code accuracy and quality over a longer performance period are being compared to faster and more efficient code quality performances, the analysis is still being processed. Fostering new relationships, learning new skills, and returning from the ensuing challenges will tell time. Whether this innovation paves the path out or we must encounter new challenges and depths we didn’t know would be revealed.Regarding ChatGPT’s impressive skills in OpenAI’s full development trail, one particular eastern application that brings tremendous value is the “Screenshot to Code.” AI will be able to run from the code generation into images, reducing the workload previously done by designers and thus improving the ease and creative work of web designers in making the site.On the other hand, no one can definitively say that the ultimate outlook of this new web technology on web development techniques is no one’s business. Being a trailblazer in the industry, ChatGPT’s mega-move is quite predictable as it is the pioneer behind the change in the web development phenomenon, and with time comes accessibility and innovativeness.

Bitcoin ETFs Rebound With $854 Million in Investments in One Week - Decrypt

Investors are again putting cash into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after a cool off last week. On Thursday, for the third consecutive day in a row, more than $100 million entered the popular new funds, data from BitMEX Research shows. The week got off to a slow start with only $1 million entering the funds on Monday. But things quickly picked up the next day with inflows of $418 million, BitMEX reports. Wednesday brought $243.4 million in inflows, and another $183 million was invested yesterday.U.S. markets are closed today for the Good Friday holiday.Last week, all the funds experienced outflows thanks to “investor hesitancy” following a dip in crypto prices. That reticence may have subsided. The most popular product remains BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has the most assets under management of the nine funds, experiencing inflows of $17.7 billion.IBIT has been so popular that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a Wednesday interview with Fox Business that he “would never have predicted” it would do so well with retail investors.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January gave the green light to 11 Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of saying no to the products. The funds allow investors to buy shares that track the underlying price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite one of the funds, Grayscale’s GBTC, experiencing massive outflows as bankrupt crypto companies redeem shares and investors move to funds with lower fees, the other ETFs are experiencing huge inflows. As a result, Bitcoin has increased significantly since the approval of the ETFs on January 11: the asset is up nearly 50%. Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $69,618 per coin, according to CoinGecko. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Horizen’s Proof Verification Chain Goes Live on Testnet



Horizen, a public blockchain platform, announced that it achieved a major milestone with the launch of its proof verification chain on the testnet.

This launch is a notable event in the Web3 space since it is the first instance of a modular proof verification network.
The Objective of Horizen
Horizen revealed in a blog post that the goal of the testnet launch is to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers. With this focus, prices for ZK rollup transactions and appchains are drastically reduced while efficiency is increased.




At its core, the new Horizen network comprises several critical components which include a revamped mainchain, proof submission interface, attestation mechanism, new Horizen smart contract, and Polygon zk-EVM rollup.
Driven by Substrate, the modular proof verification network is anchored by the Horizen mainchain. This network facilitates the exchange of ZEN, the native cryptocurrency of Horizen, as well as the validation of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances.
With an eye toward the future, Horizen stressed that it is committed to breaking new ground in the modular blockchain industry, particularly in terms of reducing costs and increasing rollup efficiencies. Crucially, Horizen wants to make the network more compatible with the addition of zkStack. By doing this, Horizen hopes to increase its market reach and interoperability.
Additionally, the blockchain platform said it also has plans to open up access to the public. This move will potentially enable the Horizen community to operate the testnet nodes and function as validators.
It is worth mentioning that the launch of Horizen’s proof verification chain testnet is only one of the platform’s latest achievements. In October, Horizen deployed a mainnet of the Ethereum Open Network (EON). Horizen EON is a smart contract sidechain platform that is completely compatible with the EVM. It is intended to play a critical role in the Web3 revolution while also empowering the next generation of developers.
Through the utilization of ZK proof verification and modular architecture, Horizen is advancing the goal of a decentralized future by creating a blockchain ecosystem that is more scalable, accessible, and efficient.
Increasing Attention on ZK Proofs Incorporation
Meanwhile, a host of blockchain platforms are making efforts toward incorporating ZK-proof solutions. For instance, Lynex and Salus recently collaborated to provide the first ZK integration on Linea, increasing privacy and confidentiality for all Lynex users. The privacy advantages are due to ZK-proofs, which ensure that trades on Lynex stay anonymous even after verification, allowing customers to trade with total confidence and anonymity.
Remarkably, Gate.io, a prominent crypto exchange has also announced improvements to its Proof of Reserves (PoR) mechanism, including a new open-source solution based on zero-knowledge technology. The primary goal of introducing zk-SNARKs is to resolve concerns about the prior system, which allowed for the inclusion of fake accounts with negative balances to alter the data.

Global Officials Emphasize Responsible Use of AI to Drive Innovation

In an event at the Swedish Embassy, the United States and Sweden leaders highlighted the future of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that may reshape all areas while reiterating the responsible and ethical use of such power to better the world.International collaboration for ethical AIMr. Paul-Arne Hjelmborn, director general for trade in the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed the importance of coordinated actions among the allied nations for building a strong framework against AI abuses. He underlined that only promoting a worldwide dialogue on the AI issues at stake could help unlock the positive outcomes and mitigate any possible setbacks. Hjelmborg accentuated the shared democratic values between the USA and Sweden, which should be the key principles for the future development of AI applications.The passage of the last non-binding resolution by the United Nations General Assembly to manage the risks arising from AI distills the first step towards a globally held consensus on AI that meets the principle of safety, reliability, and trustability of the systems we build. Moreover, by citing the EU AI Act, enacted earlier and aims to regulate the risks associated with AI development, Hjelmborn referred to the implemented framework for these risks in the EU. To achieve respect for the US policies, he believed that as long as Americans started catching the inspiration, they could consider the same regulatory edges.Although the US has made progress in dealing with AI-related issues, such as the executive order issued by President Joe Biden in October of 2023 as an effort mainly to promote the proactive and trustworthy development of AI, conducting an all-inclusive legislative policy remains a big challenge. The Senate is working on several possibilities to move things bipartisanly, but lawmakers approach the initial proposals with caution and timidity.Public and private collaboration in AI developmentAt this event, Gregory Singleton, the main AI officer for the Health and Human Services Department (HHS), greatly stressed the importance of putting high standards in place to respond to AI bias, discrimination, and harm. He highlighted the prospect of public and private partnerships for the cultivation of AI for the sake of us humans.He articulated the plausible uses of AI in the health sector, which can use machine learning as a decision-making assistant and prevent health providers from having hectic workloads. He emphasized the role of clinicians in obtaining correct data that positively affected the outcomes.The AI developers work in particular fields, and the worldwide interest focus is shifting increasingly to the responsible approach and ethical considerations. This permits reaping advantages and protection against downsides or unforeseen and unbenign effects. International cooperation, regulatory procedures, and public-private alliances must be the cornerstone for AI adoption in the outlook. Through collaborative actions and endeavors to create ethical AI solutions that implement those original principles and fundamental values, AI can have a positive impact.

Three Crypto AI Projects Announce Merger To Form ‘The Superintelligence Alliance’ With New Token in the Works - The Daily Hodl


								Fetch.ai (FET), Singularitynet (AGIX) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are merging to create the largest independent player in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development.
In a statement, Fetch.ai says it is melding minds with the two other blockchain-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms to form The Superintelligence Alliance.










“The Superintelligence Alliance is a united stand against the big tech’s control over technology. We’re joining forces to change the game on how AI is created, shared, and used by everyone leaning into the principles of decentralization to accomplish an open and equitable form of AI.”
The objective is to enable the newly formed alliance to compete with leading centralized entities.
“The resources needed to win this competition are immense and the solution needs to be vertically integrated into the whole technology stack, including infrastructure like data management, AI Agents, and models and predictions. The Alliance brings together the skills and expertise of our respective companies in the pursuit of Superintelligence (ASI).
This is our first major step in our audacious mission of creating decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and ASI.”
The development will also see the creation of a new universal token to be called Artificial Intelligence (ASI).
“The combined value of the Alliance at signing is $7.5 Billion (theoretically ranking at #20 on Coinmarketcap)p with 2.631 Billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82, with FET as the benchmark currency.”
The respective tokens of the three projects made substantial gains following the announcement. OCEAN is now trading for $1.45, up by 5.90% over the past 24 hours.  FET is priced at $3.32, up by 7.36% and AGIX is changing hands for $1.40, up by 6.82%.

Did Ripple Just Have Settlement Talks with SEC?


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was spotted earlier today at the federal courthouse in New York alongside chief lawyer Stuart Alderoty, according to photos shared by the @bobaboy76239 account on the X social media network.  As per the CourtListener legal database, there was a settlement conference scheduled for this Friday. A spokesperson for Ripple told Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett that there was "nothing to share."According to Terrett, this could be just a mandatory meeting that was supposed to take place before the pretrial conference that is scheduled to happen on Apr. 16. As per a ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, the parties were supposed to meet in person for at least one hour for settlement talks. Hence, the odds of Ripple scoring a settlement with the SEC this Friday appear to be extremely small. As reported by U.Today, the regulator is demanding that Ripple pays more than $2 billion in fees and penalties. The gargantuan sum is supposed to deter others from potential violations of the same scope. Ripple's top executives, including CEO Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, have harshly criticized the SEC. Meanwhile, Alderoty has accused the SEC of trying to intimidate Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry with such demands. Ripple is supposed to file its reply next month, meaning that the fight is far from over for the company. Meanwhile, Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino is convinced that the SEC is going to appeal Torres's controversial ruling in the Ripple case, which did not recognize the XRP token as an unregistered security in a win for the San Francisco-based company.

IdeaSoft and INTMAX To Launch JIBx DEX on Plasma Next



IdeaSoft, a member of the Sigma Software Group specializing in fintech blockchain applications, has embarked on a collaborative venture with INTMAX, developer of the open-source Ethereum scalability solution Plasma Next.

The collaboration is targeted at pioneering a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) named JIBx. The goal is to launch a groundbreaking advancement in the Plasma Next network through this collaboration. In an official press release shared with Coinspeaker, the goal is to make the DEX as convenient as any Centralized Exchange (CEX) counterpart.
IdeaSoft and INTMAX to Transform the DEX Landscape
The idea is to transform the DEX ecosystem with JIBx with plans to offer a wide range of innovative features such as zero transaction fees, restaking capabilities, and leverage of up to 250X.




The DEX has an on-chain matching engine with off-chain private settlement and account layers which is meant to guarantee both the security and efficiency of Ethereum. Ethereum gas fees had recently soared following a strong inscription debut on blobs even after the successful implementation of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. With JIBx, more efficiency can be introduced overall.
A notable feature of the DEX which is poised to be the first of its kind in that it combines the convenience of centralized exchanges with the integrity and security of decentralized platforms. This will also include an efficient funding rate model that grants rewards from collateral re-staking immediately after a user opens their position.
Other core features are stablecoin and LST staking pools, bootstrapped re-staking, and perpetual swaps with high leverage.
Just this week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin floated a proposal to enhance the decentralization and fairness of Ethereum’s staking mechanism. His program’s goal is to mitigate the errors made by validators on the effectiveness of the network.
Advancements in Ethereum Scalability Solutions
Commenting on the collaboration, Andrey Lazorenko, Co-founder and CEO of IdeaSoft, expressed confidence at the prospect of integrating INTMAX Plasma Next with his team.
According to him, “It’s exactly what we need to make many of the projects faster, more convenient for users, and finally get overwhelming adoption. Can’t wait to see what we’ll build with this.”
Similarly, INTMAX Co-founder Leona Hioki maintains confidence in the IdeaSoft team which he described as highly talented and professional, with unmatched experience in financial trading in general and virtual currency in particular. Hioki agreed with the importance of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) in Ethereum when Buterin rolled out his roadmap early last month.
Plasma Next signifies the outcome of years of development in Ethereum scalability solutions meant to address essential issues such as fund exit challenges and on-chain verification costs. The Plasma Next system eliminates the need for constant online vigilance and provides a practical solution to achieving statelessness in blockchain systems via zero-knowledge proofs.

Saudi Arabia Plans $40 Billion AI Investment Fund, Eyes Partnership with Silicon Valley's Andreessen Horowitz



                    
The Saudi Arabian government is actively considering the establishment of a massive $40 billion investment fund dedicated to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). 



This strategic move, expected to unfold in the latter half of the year, aims to position Saudi Arabia as a leading player in the AI domain.




This initiative is being spearheaded by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which is reportedly in talks with the Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) to manage the AI investments, according to a March 19 report by The New York Times, which cited three individuals familiar with the discussions. 



The collaboration might not only bring additional venture capital firms into the fold but could also lead to a16z establishing a presence in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.



Ben Horowitz, a co-founder of a16z, shares a personal connection with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Saudi fund, highlighting the close ties between the venture capital firm and the Saudi initiative. 




With the proposed $40 billion investment, Saudi Arabia is set to eclipse other major players in the AI investment space, including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

The funding for Saudi Arabia’s ambitious AI project will be sourced from its $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, with investments targeting chip manufacturers and large data centers capable of supporting AI technologies. 



The Kingdom is also exploring the possibility of launching its own AI companies.



These discussions between Saudi Arabia and a16z have been ongoing since at least April 2023. 



Horowitz has lauded Saudi Arabia as a burgeoning “startup country,” contrasting it with what he perceives as a slowdown in the United States’ startup ecosystem.



The backdrop to these developments includes recent actions by U.S. President Joe Biden, who, in October last year, issued an executive order establishing new AI safety standards. 



This initiative has garnered support from 15 leading AI firms and involves measures such as the invocation of the Defense Production Act to ensure AI companies report crucial information, including safety test results, to the Department of Commerce. 



This comes in a context where OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, sought a staggering $7 trillion investment from the United Arab Emirates, a neighbor to Saudi Arabia, for the development of more advanced semiconductor chips.

Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 708,700 followers on the social media platform X that the altcoin markets, which include all tokens except for BTC and Ethereum (ETH), are prepping to reach for a new all-time high (ATH).










“The total Altcoin market capitalization is eager for a continuation.
This means that I’m expecting a correction to be happening, or at least consolidation, before a big surge towards the ATH.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Looking at some specific altcoins, the analyst thinks Litecoin (LTC), Cosmos (ATOM) and Polkadot (DOT) are on their way up.
“Litecoin moving up, and dino coins are following.
Expecting the Ethereum ecosystem to do well, including ATOM and DOT.”
Shifting to the overall crypto market cap, which includes altcoins as well as BTC and ETH, Van de Poppe says the markets may stall momentarily before rallying once more.
“Massive run on the markets for the Crypto market capitalization.
Overall, I suspect we will consolidate before we continue to rally. 
This year has been a blast so far, and this probably continues to do so, but for now, consolidation.”

Finally, focusing on king crypto BTC, the trader tells his followers not to expect Bitcoin to jump to $100,000 too soon.
“The range is relatively defined on Bitcoin.
I don’t believe we’ll blast to $100,000 all of a sudden and are still following the path of the 4-year cycle, for now. 
Consolidating areas at $60,000 support ranges, areas around ATH to be resistance. 
In between chop.”

BTC is worth $69,440 at time of writing, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin Will Rocket To $150,000 By 2025, Veteran Hedge Fund Manager Predicts ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has increased astronomically in recent months to hit as high as $73,737 on March 14, 2024. Despite this phenomenal growth, is there room for BTC to hit six figures from its current trading price? 



Mark Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, thinks it is possible. Yusko recently postulated that Bitcoin’s next market cycle could see the premier crypto trade for $150,000 by 2025 as the upcoming halving event could add to the ETF tailwinds for the asset.



Bitcoin Will Top $150K In 2025



While appearing on CNBC on March 28, Mark Yusko shared a bold price forecast: Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an eye-popping $150,000 in the coming months. Yusko uses Metcalfe’s law model to estimate BTC’s present “fair value” at $50,000.



The next halving, which is now three weeks away, has historically been a major catalyst for crypto rallies. The pre-programmed halving mechanism reduces BTC’s block rewards by 50% every four years.



When the block rewards get slashed to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has to soar for the miners to continue to make money, the Morgan Creek executive noted. As the price rises, so does the fair value. Yusko added that this cycle will likely be different owing to transaction fees generated by Ordinals and Inscriptions. As such, he envisions a fair value of $75,000 post-halving as there will be increased investor interest and FOMO hitting full swing.

“So in the last cycle fair value was $30,000, we got to as high as $69,000. This time, I think probably two times because there’s less leverage. So that gets us to $150,000,” Yusko explained.



If history repeats itself, an even more bullish period for Bitcoin could be on the horizon in the months following the halving. In Yusko’s opinion, Bitcoin could hit the $150K projected peak roughly nine months after the April halving:



“Well, think about it… if there’s more demand than supply, the price has to rise. So the price starts to rise. It starts to become more exponential or parabolic toward the end of the year, and historically, about nine months after the halving. So sometime toward Thanksgiving, Christmas we see the peak in price before the next bear market.”



Meanwhile, other big names have also made similar bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Rich Dad Poor Dad author sees BTC hitting $100,000 after the halving, while British multinational bank Standard Chartered expects the OG crypto to reach $150,000 this year.

Polymarket sees bets of $2.4 million on Ethereum ETF approval

Crypto traders have entered the speculative market, making bets on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The United States SEC is set to make its verdict before May 31, and market participants have lined up to make bets on it on Ploymarket.Polymarket registers bets on the approval of a spot Ethereum ETFPolymarket is a crypto-based gambling platform where participants in the crypto market make bets on the likelihood of events happening. The current dynamics on Polymarket have shown that traders are actively speculating on the outcome of the SEC concerning the Ethereum ETF approval. Presently, over $2.4 million worth of bets have been placed on the platform, with about 81% of the traders unsure of the likelihood of an approval occurring before the end of May.Crypto traders purchase shares that reflect their choice of bets on Polymarket. The value of the shares on the platform is volatile, fluctuating to mirror real-life sentiments in the market. Presently, the share representing Yes for approval goes for $0.19, while a share representing No goes for $0.81. The current pricing is an indication that there is little belief that the approval will happen before the set date, and traders are betting on it.Notably, both categories of shares have seen a significant amount of investment made in them. Presently, the highest investment in the Yes category is worth $84,000 while the highest investment in the No category stands at $127,000. The investment made in these shares shows how serious traders on Polymarket are willing to back their predictions.Market sentiment and Grayscale’s optimismThe outcome of the bets placed on Polymarket lies solely on the action of the United States SEC toward the approval of an Ethereum ETF. This means that the SEC needs to approve an Ethereum ETF by May 31, 2024, at 11:59 ET for Yes share bettors to win their bets. While the traders who hold the No shares will win if the SEC doesn’t approve the ETF by the deadline.This is not the first time such actions tied to the crypto industry will be taking place on the platform. Before the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF, bettors on the platform made bets on it. However, there has been criticism from all angles on bettors on the platform, with most people questioning why they would choose to engage in an activity that yields such little profits.Despite the skepticism, the betting market for ETF outcomes has seen substantial activity, with at least $12 million in total bets. Interestingly, investment management firm Grayscale has expressed optimism regarding the approval of spot Ether ETFs. Craig Salm, Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer, emphasized that the SEC’s apparent lack of engagement with applicants should not be construed as a definitive indicator of approval or rejection.This confidence from a prominent player in the crypto investment space adds another dimension to the ongoing speculation surrounding ETF approvals. The gambling market surrounding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC reflects the diverse sentiments and expectations within the crypto community. As the May 31 deadline approaches, traders continue to monitor developments closely, with their bets serving as a barometer of market sentiment and confidence in regulatory outcomes.

CFTC commissioner warns against infringing on SEC’s authority in KuCoin case

Caroline Pham, a commissioner with the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has suggested that a recent “aggressive” crypto enforcement action could put the regulator at odds with the Securities and Exchange Commission.In a March 29 statement, Pham said the CFTC appeared to have exerted authority over certain securities in its enforcement case against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. The commission charged the firm “with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations” on March 26, parallel to criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department.“The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets,” said Pham. “Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”Related: KuCoin says user assets are unaffected by US SDNY indictmentPham’s statement echoed concerns from many U.S. lawmakers and regulators about the role the CFTC and SEC should play over cryptocurrencies and how they are judged as commodities or securities. Officials representing both regulators have been at odds over Ether (ETH) recently as crypto firm Prometheum announced it planned to offer custody services as a security. The KuCoin complaint from the CFTC suggested that Ether was a commodity. However, legal experts said the SEC potentially labeling ETH as a security could impact the commission’s decision on several spot Ether exchange-traded fund applications in the pipeline.Magazine: KuCoin’s desperate $10M airdrop, 1 tweet raises $37M for memecoin: Asia Express

Vitalik Buterin Calls Out Copy-And-Paste Meme Coins: 'I Want To See Higher Quality Fun Projects' Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Calls Out Copy-And-Paste Meme Coins: 'I Want To See Higher Quality Fun Projects' - Benzinga

A co-founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum ETH/USD is sharing his thoughts on a crypto cycle that has favored meme coins.Here's what Vitalik Buterin had to say in a recent post.What Happened: Fresh off his commentary on the metaverse being "poorly defined," Buterin shared his thoughts on meme coins and the good and bad that could be realized.Back in 2014, Buterin shared thoughts on how issuing new coins could help fund public projects."The thinking went: society needs ways to fund valuable large-scale projects, markets and institutions are the main techniques that we have today, and both work in some cases and fail in others," Buterin said.Buterin said issuing new coins could be a third class of funding technology."People who care about cancer research could hold, accept and trade AntiCancerCoin; people who care about saving the environment would hold and use ClimateCoin, and so forth. The coins that people choose to use would determine what causes got funded."Buterin said that meme coins are now a huge topic in 2024, continuing on the same path as meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD in 2020 and 2021."This time, they are heating up again, but in a way that is making many people feel uneasy, because there isn't anything particularly new and interesting about the meme coins."The Ethereum co-founder said that several Solana SOL/USD meme coins are "openly super racist.” Buterin said that people should stand "against this stupidity."Meme Coins For Good: Among the positives in the meme coin space are charity coins where a portion of the token supply or an ongoing fee goes to a charity, the Ethereum co-founder said. Buterin names GiveWell Inu and Fable of the Dragon Tyrant as coins that have supported charity. Both coins have their flaws he said, and they include a lack of maintenance for GiveWell Inu and Dragon Tyrant having "annoying" community members."It feels like there is an unclaimed opportunity here to try to create something more positive-sum and long-lasting. But ultimately, I think even that would create something fundamentally limited, and we can do better," Buterin said.Buterin highlighted what he calls "Robin Hood games" in his post.The Ethereum co-founder said he recognized play-to-earn mechanics in Axie Infinity and how people in low-income Southeast Asian countries have been able to benefit from the game."I get the impression that if you take the game's play-to-earn properties into account, on average, the net financial gains were negative for high-income users but might (emphasis on might!) have been positive for low-income users."Buterin said this is the way it should be, adding that it’s best to put the safety net on lower-income users and be "brutal on those who can handle it.""We should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games and games that leave lower-income players in particular economically better off."Related Link: 5 Things That May Surprise You About Ethereum Creator Vitalik ButerinWhy It's Important: Buterin says people buy meme coins because the value might go up, they are open to participation and they are fun."We can siphon off a large percent of a meme coin's supply to support public goods that people value," Buterin said.Buterin said he has no enthusiasm for coins that are scams, rugpulls or named after totalitarian political movements."I want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them get more mindshare."Ideally, Buterin said there would be more good meme coins than bad meme coins and a common goal of supporting public goods.Read Next: As Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Surge, Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Warns ‘Some Categories..Are Way Over-Invested’Vitalik Buterin.

American crypto lobbyists might just be our biggest problem | Cryptopolitan

America, land of the free, home of the brave, and now, a playground for crypto lobbyists who seem to have taken the term “influencing policy” to an entirely new level, kickstarting a sort of political war that could very well dictate the future of finance in the United States. Think I’m being dramatic? Okay.Read on!You’d think with high-profile cases like Sam Bankman-Fried’s, serving a 25-year vacation in prison for his crypto shenanigans, and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, awaiting his fate for skirting around some important legal policies, America would be on the verge of taming the beast that is cryptocurrency industry. Not to mention, the spectacular implosion of digital tokens like Luna has left many a crypto magnate looking less like the future of finance and more like cautionary tales.Do NOT jump in.That’s what *they* say.The Undying Spirit of Crypto EnthusiastsBut man, despite all the setbacks, the crypto industry is doing better than ever. Bitcoin, the poster child of cryptocurrencies, recently hit a record-breaking $73,000. This is because the folks mining Bitcoin decided to slow their roll, and also of course, because the gates have been flung wide open for bitcoin exchange traded funds, thanks to the nod from our friendly neighborhood SEC.Now, what’s truly mind-blowing to me is how the crypto sector, in the face of all these regulatory slapdowns, has decided to double down on its efforts to sway future regulatory frameworks. And I’m not just talking about a few million dollars thrown at political campaigns.Oh no. There is a full-blown, wallet-breaking campaign that has seen crypto lobbying funds jump from a mere $1.5 million in 2020 to a jaw-dropping $27 million in 2022. And with the FTX drama not deterring these efforts, 2023 saw an even bigger splash of cash, mainly from Coinbase, alongside the Blockchain Association and Binance.It gets even better — or worse, depending on how you look at it.A so-called crypto dark money group called ‘Fairshake’ managed to get around $80 million in just the last quarter of 2023. Their mission was to take down any political figure daring to question the sanctity of cryptocurrency, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown being prime targets. As one would expect.A Tangled Web of Money and PoliticsThe audacity of crypto lobbying efforts is mostly in their willingness to dive headfirst into American politics, challenging the very ethos of what many believed cryptocurrencies stood for — a financial system untainted by the grip of traditional power structures.Yet, here we are, witnessing the crypto industry not just engaging with but actively shaping the political scene in America. The story spun by Fairshake and other crypto proponents about fostering innovation and needing a clearer regulatory framework might sound noble. However, when you peel back the layers, it’s clear that the end goal is to carve out an industry where they can thrive with minimal oversight.Comparisons with traditional banking and other sectors’ lobbying efforts are inevitable.Yes, the crypto lobbying machine might still be in its infancy compared to the Goliaths of the financial world, but what sets it apart is its focused aggression and the bipartisan nature of its influence. So both Republicans and Democrats find themselves in the crosshairs of crypto lobbyists.The irony of it all? Crypto, once hailed as the digital David against the Goliath of the financial establishment, has now cozied up to the very “swamp” it aimed to drain. The Blockchain Association’s reluctant admission of their lobbying efforts as a necessary evil to protect their interests showcases the ironic position our industry finds itself in.Sooooo, yeah that’s about it.

Unexplained transfers on LENX protocol spark rug pull concerns

Rumors of a slow rug pull involving liquidity protocol LENX are flooding social media channels as the community speculates about unexplained transfers of tokens worth millions of dollars. According to reports from pseudonymous X user AstroBoy and Etherscan data, LENX Finance’s founders, John Kim and a person simply known as Paul, had transferred over $10 million worth of treasury assets to a Binance account without clear justification, draining LENX wallets. Source: AstroBoyOn the protocol’s Discord server, users have complained about the lack of communication since the transactions were first spotted on March 26, along with consistent transfers to Binance and messages about the suspicious withdrawals being removed.The protocol was launched in January 2024, promising to support native Bitcoin for yield generation or to borrow against. According to CoinGecko, LENX’s native token, LENX XD (XD), was valued at $0.26 in early January, versus $0.02 at the time of writing. LENX is backed by the lending protocol FRAX Finance. Cointelegraph reached out to both co-founders of LENX Finance but did not receive an immediate response. The FRAX Finance team was not available for comment. Community member 0xg4m813 points to issues surrounding the protocol amid debate over funds transfers. Source: LENX's DiscordMedia company Flywheel DeFi reportedly spoke with Kim over a chat, but the co-founder declined to comment. “Sorry, I don’t have much to say at the moment,” Kim wrote. Paul’s last Discord activity was on March 26, when he announced he was investigating the withdrawals. “I’m trying to investigate right now.”According to reports on Discord, the LENX team was able to freeze the Binance account that received the funds, with $3 million in remaining funds safeguarded. An ongoing investigation is reportedly in progress over Kim’s activities, while Paul is cooperating with legal efforts. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers suddenly withdraw all funds from a project or liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens or assets.In 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that crypto-related investment fraud saw a significant increase in the United States, with losses rising from $2.57 billion in 2022 to approximately $3.94 billion, marking a 53% increase.

New Development on the Arbitrum (ARB) Front: Developers Announced - Bitcoin Sistemi


Arbitrum (ARB) Foundation announced the launch of the third phase of its funding plan. The application process for this phase will be open from April 15 until the end of June.
This phase will primarily focus on decentralized application (dApp) projects, including games, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), social platforms, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Projects will be categorized according to their stages, growth forecasts and types, and allocated to specific financing channels.


The application form for Phase 2 will officially close on April 3, 2024. Following this, new applications for Phase 3 will open on April 15, 2024.
The grants in question will be distributed to developers in ARB.





Previously, Arbitrum held a public competition in October as part of a $44 million short-term incentive program.
Projects funded by Arbitrum's incentive program have mostly grown in terms of total value locked (TVL), volume, fees, and daily active users (DAUs) after receiving funding. However, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has increased over this time period, so it is probably too early to draw conclusions about the funds' effectiveness.

UK and U.S. unite to expose Russia's $20 billion illegal crypto trade | Cryptopolitan

The United States and the United Kingdom have rolled up their sleeves and are investigating what looks like a gross $20 billion mishandling of crypto. Yeah, you heard that right. $20 billion with a ‘B’.They’re zeroing in on Garantex, that Russian exchange that’s been under so many sanctions, amidst a storm of crypto transactions that could very well be fueling Russia’s unsavory adventures in Ukraine.The stakes? BIG.The implications? Even bigger.I’m talking about the huge amount of USDT—Tether, the darling of the crypto market that [tries to] sticks to the dollar like glue—sashaying through Garantex.So you know this Moscow-based exchange has been the go-to spot for all kinds of illegal crypto transactions, despite having a big, red ‘sanctioned’ stamp on its forehead by both the U.S. and UK.A Cat-and-Mouse GameNow Garantex has had its share of the limelight since its birth in 2019 Estonia. Fast forward to today, and it’s practically got its roots buried deep in Moscow’s Federation Tower. Estonia showed Garantex the door back in February 2022, right around when Uncle Sam and the Brits were sharpening their sanctions pencils.The U.S. Treasury isn’t playing around either.They’ve got Garantex in their sights, for being the perfect playground for bad guys, including a certain Russia-based ransomware posse known as Conti. These guys were supposedly having a field day with over $100 million in illicit activities, all under Garantex’s watch. And to make things worse, Garantex was caught on camera, cozying up with sanctioned Russian banks and mapping out ways to keep the US dollar within arm’s reach, despite the sanctions.Oops.Oh Crypto, the Double-Edged Sword You AreTether, the diva right in the middle of this whole problem, sits on a throne made of over $100 billion worth of coins. She’s like the James Bond of cryptocurrencies—smooth, reliable, and always on a mission.Tether Holdings claims they’ve got everything under control. Every transaction is under the microscope, and they’re in cahoots with law enforcement to keep the monsters at bay.“With Tether, every criminal can be caught,” they say. Bold words, no? Because as we all know, criminals have a soft spot for Tether. It’s their go-to currency for everything shady, from online scams that would make your grandma’s head spin to dodgy deals that cross international borders. And despite Tether Holdings’ best efforts to freeze assets tied to the naughty list, the $19.3 billion in illicit transactions tells a different story.So I’m not really sure about that, Tether.As for the U.S. and UK, they seem to have once again found a common enemy to play friends against. Can’t wait to see what happens next.

U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer Paying $7,000,000 Fine, Admit To Using Unofficial Communications Channels in Federal Crackdown - The Daily Hodl


								U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer & Co will pay a total of $7 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a federal crackdown on off-channel communications and improper record keeping.
The CFTC has jointly ordered both U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer & Co, an introducing broker, to pay $6 million and $1 million in civil monetary penalties respectively for the same offense.










The CFTC says the firms have admitted that from at least 2019 until now, both of the firms failed to prevent their employees from using unapproved communication channels such as personal text messages.
“The firms were required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firm’s CFTC-registered businesses. 
These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by either firm, and neither firm generally would have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.
Each order further finds the firm-wide use of unapproved communication methods violated each firm’s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited business-related communication via unapproved methods. Further, some of the supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firm’s policies and procedures also used unapproved communication methods to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.”
U.S. Bank reportedly has about $650 billion in assets under management while Oppenheimer has $28 billion.
The CFTC says that since December 2021, the agency has imposed a total of $1.124 billion in civil monetary penalties on 22 different financial institutions for the same violation – the unapproved communication methods, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements.
Last year, the US-registered broker-dealer arm of BNP Paribas said it was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC for possibly breaking record-keeping provisions and for using private text messages for communcation.

Vitalik Buterin Praises Worldcoin, Despite Privacy Concerns - DailyCoin


        
Vitalik Buterin praises Worldcoin’s privacy and data handling methods.



Worldcoin’s efforts aim to establish a global, unique digital identity system.



Multiple governments have banned Worldcoin due to privacy concerns. 
Worldcoin has been in the spotlight for its novel approach to creating a universal digital identity through iris scanning. However, this method has not been without its critics, who raise concerns over the potential for privacy infringement.Despite the criticism, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently voiced his support for Worldcoin’s efforts to address these privacy concerns. Privacy is a top issue for the project, as it relies on biometric data, scanning users’ irises to create a unique digital identity for each user. Buterin Commends Worldcoin for Taking Privacy SeriouslyOn Friday, March 29, Vitalik Buterin, known for his pioneering work with Ethereum, recognized Worldcoin’s efforts to balance creating a universal digital identity with the need for stringent privacy measures. In a Tweet reply to tech writer Louis Anslow, Buternin commended Worldcoin for “taking privacy concerns seriously.” He also highlighted the project’s advances in cryptography, making its approach “data minimal.”
There are many privacy concerns, and they primarily revolve around the potential misuse of biometric data. Specifically, Worldcoin’s system stores hashed versions of iris scans and claims this system protects user’s privacy. Despite this, there are still worries about potential identity theft. 
The potential for hacking, coercion, and system misuse, such as selling or renting IDs, presents significant security risks. Buterin also stresses the importance of a reliable mechanism for identity recovery to prevent financial loss and misuse.Worldcoin Banned, Investigated in Multiple CountriesButerin’s latest remarks came when multiple governments have investigated or outright banned Worldcoin. For instance, Kenya has been a significant market for Worldcoin, before suspending orb scanning over privacy concerns. The suspension remains until authorities are convinced there’s no risk to the public. In France, investigations into Worldcoin focus on its biometric data collection practices, questioning their compliance with data protection regulations. Additionally, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced it would be investigating the company. Argentina has also opened an investigation into Worldcoin, examining its handling of personal data amid growing concerns over the project’s adherence to privacy laws​​. Moreover, Spain temporarily banned Worldcoin operations over similar issues for up to three months. On the Flipside
Worldcoin aims to create a universal digital identity to simplify and secure online verification processes. The goal is to make it easier for individuals to access services and for companies to authenticate users. 



A security audit published on March 15 found that Worldcoin has no security vulnerabilities. The audit came after a major hack to the network. 
Why This MattersThe discussion surrounding Worldcoin and its potential use cases sheds light on the broader implications for digital identity. However, the project has to navigate major challenges, especially regarding privacy protection. Read more about Worldcoin’s ban in Spain: Spain Blocks Worldcoin as a “Precautionary Measure”Read more about Ethereum’s latest milestone: Ethereum Reaches 1M Validators: Will it Boost the Network?

CFTC Commissioner Slams Agency After KuCoin Charges

                        CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham issued a statement Friday seemingly criticizing her own agency for its latest “aggressive enforcement action” following the agency’s KuCoin charges, saying it might “infringe upon the SEC’s authority.”While Pham commended the independent government agency’s “vigilance” in “protecting” U.S. markets through the KuCoin charges, she expressed concern that the move may overstep the CFTC’s role in crypto regulation.CFTC Commissioner Slams Agency’s KuCoin Charges
“The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets,” Pham said in the statement. “Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”CFTC charged the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin on Tuesday, alleging that the digital asset firm engaged in a wide range of illegal activities, including dealing in off-exchange commodity futures, offering unregistered leveraged or margined transactions, and improperly soliciting orders.Equally important, the federal agency claims that the crypto exchange did not adequately implement know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, calling them a “sham” that “did not prevent U.S. customers from trading commodity interests and derivatives on the platform.”The Battle Between The CFTC And SEC Continues
The CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have long fought over who would lead the country’s regulatory approach in the cryptocurrency sector.The CFTC typically regulates commodities, while the SEC traditionally controls securities.In a similar yet separate criminal matter on Tuesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) hit KuCoin with its own set of charges, including “violating the Bank Secrecy Act” and “operating an unlicensed money transmitter business.”Meanwhile, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu pushed back against the charges in a statement posted to X, claiming they were standard for the digital asset industry. While the SEC has approved Bitcoin for spot ETF trading, recent reports indicate that the federal agency is looking to label Ethereum as a security, diminishing hopes for a spot ETH ETF.Conversely, the CFTC’s enforcement action labels Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities.Strife Amongst Crytpo Regulatory Bodies?
Meanwhile, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long been under scrutiny for his stringent regulation-by-enforcement approach, failing to provide a clear regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.The SEC has an infamous history of cracking down on perceived crypto-related securities violations and instigating legal battles with key players in the digital asset industry, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs.The CFTC Commissioner’s statement of disagreement may reveal deeper frustrations of federal agency employees in the difficult quest of regulating the crypto sector.

BlackRock's Larry Fink is bullish on Bitcoin as spot Bitcoin ETFs fly

The approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange Commission has caused a storm in the ETF industry. And now, according to Farside, the total net inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $12 billion. On an average basis, there have been $258 million worth of inflows to BlackRock’s IBIT, followed by $140 million to Fidelity’s FBTC and $29.9 million to Bitwise’s BITB.Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?This new type of security has grown four-fold thanks to mainstream financial institutions’ support. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who recently discussed rethinking the U.S. retirement age, is optimistic about Bitcoin ETFs’ future. In an interview with Fox Business, he discussed BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT. “IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,” he said. “Nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.”Fink seems optimistic about Ether ETFs, too. He recently said an ETH ETF is possible even if the SEC treats Ether like a security. Last week, the financial watchdog sent subpoenas to three companies as part of its probe of the Ethereum Foundation, the ecosystem that works behind the Ethereum blockchain network. The 11th spot Bitcoin ETF is ready to tradeEarlier this week, Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, one of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC, was launched. Crypto asset management’s Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF is trading on the NYSE Arca exchange. Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF currently holds 5,500 Bitcoin worth $377.2 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s IBIT holds 244560 Bitcoin, worth $17.1 billion. The crypto market is boomingThe emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country has been a boon for the crypto market, which had experienced a major crisis over the previous few years. But now Bitcoin has hit record highs. And the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will occur in mid-April, is expected to boost the crypto market even further. This event will reduce the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half. Previous halving events have sent Bitcoin prices higher. Bitcoin’s most recent halving took place on May 11, 2020, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 Bitcoin. This year’s halving will reduce the reward to 3.125 Bitcoin for miners.According to CoinMarketCap, in the past week, Bitcoin has risen 9% to $69,000, Ether has jumped 4.7% to $3,500, and Dogecoin has soared 40% to $0.21.

Bitcoin Futures Approved For Trading On Brazil's B3 Exchange, Launching April 17 | Bitcoinist.com


								In response to the global demand for Bitcoin-related products, Brazil has seized the opportunity to capitalize on the momentum surrounding the leading cryptocurrency. 
According to a Reuters report, Brazilian exchange operator B3 announced on Thursday that it has received approval from Brazil’s securities regulator to offer Bitcoin futures trading, which is expected to begin on April 17.
BTC Futures Linked To Nasdaq Reference Price
B3 announced that the official launch date of futures trading for BTC may be subject to change. Nevertheless, the exchange confirmed that future contracts will be linked to the Nasdaq Bitcoin reference price, with each contract representing 10% of the BTC price in Brazilian reais.

Felipe Goncalves, B3’s superintendent of swap rates and currency products, emphasized the significance of this milestone, stating: 
The launch meets the demand for a derivative that allows a hedge against Bitcoin’s price fluctuations or a directional exposure to the asset. 
It is important to note that the Bitcoin futures contract offered by B3 will be settled financially, meaning that no actual buying or selling of BTC will occur. 
This approach aligns with the landscape of regulated derivatives markets, allowing investors to engage with Bitcoin’s price movements without requiring direct ownership of the cryptocurrency.
Brazil Welcomes BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF
This development coincides with one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, and a prominent Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) issuer announcing the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) launch in Brazil in early March. 
Felipe Gonçalves highlighted the growth of the crypto market in Brazil, citing the existence of 13 ETFs with a total asset value of R$2.5 billion (approximately $505 million). Notably, the market has attracted institutional investors, including funds and individual investors, with a current count of 170,000. 
The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) is expected to have a management fee of 0.25%, with a one-year waiver that reduces the fee to 0.12% once the fund surpasses $5 billion in assets under management. 

With B3’s regulatory approval for Bitcoin futures trading and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF launch, Brazil is solidifying its position as a significant player in the expanding global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. 
These developments provide investors with new avenues to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while fostering the growth and maturation of Brazil’s crypto investment landscape.

The largest cryptocurrency in the market trades at $70,400, demonstrating a rebound from the $60,800 level following a significant correction. BTC has successfully consolidated above this crucial level over the past 24 hours, indicating a strong momentum to surpass its previous all-time high of $73,700, achieved on March 14.
Examining the cryptocurrency’s performance over longer time frames, we see that BTC has exhibited substantial gains. In the past week alone, an impressive increase of 11% was recorded. BTC has experienced a notable surge of 16% in the past month. 
Furthermore, its year-to-date growth is nearly 150%, highlighting the sustained bullish trend that has prevailed since the end of the bear market and the subsequent recovery from the 2022 crypto winter.

Telegram’s Mini Apps tipped to encourage blockchain adoption 1

Director of Investments at TON Foundation Justin Hyun has referred to the emergence of Mini Apps on Telegram as a catalyst that will trigger mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mini Apps are blockchain-based DeFi applications on Telegram, which were launched in 2020. The applications were launched in a bid to simplify interactions on the blockchain without the need for any background education.Telegram set to simplify blockchain adoption with Mini AppsThis perspective shared by Hyun about Mini Apps is in line with the concept of introducing users to the blockchain without using the DApps label. According to Hyun, they can be seen as a ‘Trojan Horse’, where users are allowed to mingle across several apps on Telegram. This way, the users are oblivious to the underlying blockchain technology while enjoying the user-friendly applications on the platform. He mentioned that this approach is very integral to expanding the user base on the blockchain.Telegram ranks in third place among messaging applications, boasting an active user base of over 800 million. Aside from providing the user base for integrating blockchain functionality, its collaboration with the TON Foundation shows the potential of Mini Apps to boost blockchain adoption.A very important aspect of the platform is offering several rewards to its users. This feature will encourage user participation and promote engagement in blockchain-based events without deep-rooted technical knowledge. Telegram also acts as a financial payments feature within its TON blockchain, solidifying its push for innovative financial solutions.Financial incentives and monetization opportunitiesTelegram’s recent launch of its advertising platform on the TON blockchain marks a significant push in its intention to monetize the platform and encourage content creators with rewards. Owners of channels on Telegram can now earn rewards through their advertisements, a revenue model that provides earning opportunities for both Telegram and the content creators.Also, TON Foundation recently announced a $115 million incentive program for its community, a move to solidify its growth strategy. The funds would be used for token mining, liquidity pool boosts, airdrops, and some other incentives on the platform. The initiatives will push for a strong ecosystem around the Mini Apps while helping to push the adoption of its blockchain among different users across the world.The vision of bringing the next 500 million users onto the blockchain by 2028 reflects a long-term commitment to mainstream adoption. Hyun emphasizes the importance of starting with simple use cases that seamlessly integrate blockchain technology, paving the way for more sophisticated applications in the future. This gradual approach ensures a smooth transition for users and promotes sustained growth in blockchain adoption.Telegram’s Mini Apps presents a great opportunity to provide democratic access to blockchain technology. It also provides a way to accelerate its integration into the lives of users. Through its user-friendly interfaces, Mini Apps will play an integral role in shaping the future of dApps. Aside from that, it will also provide web3 incentives that would trigger an increase in blockchain adoption on a huge scale.

Massive USDC inflow to Coinbase boosts confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum

Coinbase, an outstanding cryptocurrency exchange, received $1.4 billion, the USDC stablecoin backed by the USA dollars and Circle issued. This deal has kept the process of cryptocurrency currency brainstorming, as for the majority, it is considered a clear indication of investors’ readiness to invest their money in this domain of digital finance. Analysts now speculate that such a big inflow will have a ‘significant effect’ on the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, among the other digital coins.USDC influx to CoinbaseThe fact that a large volume of USDC is pumped into Coinbase, in the view of market observers, is interpreted as a positive sign for the market. Stablecoins such as USDC and USDT play a key part in the ramping between fiats like dollars and digital currencies; they act as a bridge and allow for access to liquidity and the ability to exchange in real-time. The return of fiat money in the form of stablecoins to the exchanges tends to move in parallel with the direction of a cryptocurrency market in bullish conditions because of the assumption that increased purchases often follow it.Bitcoin, which was still trading under the key barrier of 71,600 dollars, might change due to this issue, and the same can be said for Ethereum, which is also streaming around these levels. At the moment, sellers are in the top spot (and since this turn of events, bulls have failed to break the resistance and create higher highs), but with recent USDC transactions, investors have established a trend that makes them buy or even sell more crypto. This twist in the story may create necessary circumstances for refinancing and securing better ratings among the investors.Such voting in favor of an asset has not been observed only in this situation: other times when a surplus of the USDC coin has been transferred to Coinbase, prices of cryptocurrencies have risen. Similar effects occurred in January 2023 for a $1.3 billion inflow, followed by a notable increase in Bitcoin costs. USDC Surge and Market DynamicsThe fact that the historical data ultimately turns out to be at least as effective as the current optimism lending weight to what is now booming on the market captures the role of such precedents of history. Moreover, the growing prominence of USDC is reflective of broader trends within the crypto ecosystem. Currently, USDC boasts a market capitalization of $32.5 billion, closely trailing XRP, which holds a market cap of over $34 billion. This tight race underscores stablecoins’ increasing acceptance and utilization as essential tools for facilitating crypto transactions and investmentsXRP, which holds a market cap of over $34 billion. stablecoins as essential tools for facilitating crypto transactions and investments. The Saga between Tether and Bitfinex reflects a major concern around the crypto market: the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.With 615 million salvaged by one exchange alone, the USDC inflow into Coinbase is more than just a potential boon to the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum; it is a sign that the crypto market is maturing and integrating more into the traditional financial ecosystem. The immediate connection between the substantial flow of stablecoin in the market and the rise in the crypto asset prices cannot entirely be proven because other factors also play a role in the determinants of market dynamics. Nevertheless, such events are a factor that boosts the overall market confidence.

Here’s Where Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Would Be With The Market Cap Of Ethereum | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are trending higher than they were a year ago, but they are still a long way from their 2021 all-time high prices. While they both feature prominently in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, they are still far below the market cap of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. So, if both DOGE and SHIB attained the market cap of Ethereum, what price would they be trading at?
Dogecoin With The Market Cap Of Ethereum
The Dogecoin market cap is currently sitting $30.7 billon while the price is at $0.214. This makes it the largest meme coin in the space in terms of market cap and puts it ahead of the likes of Shiba Inu. However, if the DOGE market cap were to reach the market cap of Ethereum, the price would trade much higher than it is now.

The MarketCapOf website shows where one cryptocurrency would be trading with the market cap of another, and in this case, it’s Dogecoin compared to Ethereum. If the DOGE market cap were to reach $424 billion, which is the current market cap of ETH, its price would trade at $2.96. Such a price point would mean that the DOGE price would be trading at 1,300% higher than its current price level.

Source: MarketCapOf
Then to take it one step further, the website shows where the Dogecoin price would be if its market cap were to reach the all-time high market cap of Ethereum. This would put it at $3.97 per coin with a market cap of $571.66 billion. It would also be 1,800% higher than its current price.
On the flip side, ETH, with the market cap of DOGE, would mean that the former would be trading at $255.89 per coin. It would be 93% lower than its current price, with a market cap of $30.7 billion.
Shiba Inu With The Market Cap Of Ethereum
Comparing the Shiba Inu price with the market cap of Ethereum leaves a large disparity between its current value and where it will be. As the website shows, SHIB’s price, if it reaches $424 billion, would sit at $0.00071637. Consequently, this would mean a more than 2,300% increase from its current level.

Then, looking at SHIB with the all-time high market cap of ETH puts it at 3,100% higher at $0.0009691. Inversely, Ethereum trading at the market cap of Shiba Inu puts it at a mere $150, which is 96% lower than its current price of $3,500.
This comparison shows the disparity between the assets despite all being some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space. It also gives investors an idea of what to expect if the price of these coins were to continue growing over time.

Custodia Bank Loses Lawsuit Challenging Fed Rejection of Master Account Application

"Thus, unless Federal Reserve Banks possess discretion to deny or reject a master account application, state chartering laws would be the only layer of insulation for the U.S. financial system," the judge wrote. "And in that scenario, one can readily foresee a 'race to the bottom' among states and politicians to attract business by reducing state chartering burdens through lax legislation, allowing minimally regulated institutions to gain ready access to the central bank's balances and Federal Reserve services."

Crypto Biz: Exchanges face new legal issues, Goldman Sachs’ clients eye crypto, and more

Crypto exchanges are facing a new wave of regulatory hurdles worldwide, with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicting KuCoin and its founders on March 26 for allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The charges coincide with a civil enforcement case by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), alleging multiple violations by the exchange. The DOJ claims KuCoin handled over $5 billion in suspicious and criminal funds.Staying in the United States, another setback hit Coinbase on March 27. District Judge Katherine Failla denied the exchange’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that similar transactions have previously been considered securities transactions. Coinbase sought an order to drop the case, challenging the SEC’s authority over crypto exchanges.In the Philippines, the financial regulator decided to block local users’ access to Binance on March 25, citing concerns over the firm’s unlicensed operations in the country. According to the agency, the exchange offered leveraged trading services and crypto savings accounts to local users without licenses.Meanwhile, in Russia, Binance’s successor, CommEx, has officially announced that it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits. The company acquired Binance’s Russian business for an undisclosed amount in September 2023. Along with the exchanges’ challenges, this week’s Crypto Biz explores BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, Goldman Sachs’ clients returning to crypto, SWIFT’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, and Mastercard’s forecasts for remittances in Latin America. BlackRock’s ETF could flip GBTC in Bitcoin holdings within three weeksBlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is on track to surpass the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings in about three weeks, given the current rate of inflows and outflows. As of March 22, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF held 238,500 Bitcoin (BTC) on its books, worth nearly $15.5 billion at current prices, with daily inflows averaging 4,120 BTC. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has 350,252 BTC worth $23 billion but is experiencing average daily outflows of $277 million or 4,140 BTC. In another ETF headline, asset manager Hashdex has officially joined the spot Bitcoin ETF market after completing the conversion of its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin. Hashdex renamed and converted its Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF to the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF with the ticker “DEFI.”Galaxy Digital reports $296 million net income in 2023 after $1 billion loss in 2022Digital asset management firm Galaxy Digital has reported a net income of $296 million for 2023, marking a reversal after ending 2022 with a $1 billion net loss. The performance shift is due to the rising prices of major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The firm’s assets under management grew from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2023 and nearly doubled in the first two months of 2024, reaching $10.1 billion by the end of February. The firm also reported $18.7 million in mining revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 31% increase over the previous quarter. “Our average marginal cost to mine in the fourth quarter increased relative to prior quarters due to fewer opportunities to economically curtail our mining operations and a higher network hash rate,” the company said in its statement.Goldman Sachs hedge fund clients are piling back into cryptoGoldman Sachs’ clients have started to jump back into crypto, with renewed appetite stemming from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, told Bloomberg that many of his firm’s largest clients had recently become active or were “exploring getting active” in the crypto sector. Goldman’s options and futures offerings are the primary source of fresh demand, with hedge funds being the most involved among its clients, according to Minton. Goldman’s clients use their derivatives primarily to gain exposure to crypto volatility and to make long-term predictions about prices, said the executive, adding that Bitcoin-related products stood as the most popular investment vehicles among active clients.SWIFT declares second sandbox connector tests a success for CBDC and moreThe SWIFT messaging network has released the results of the second phase of sandbox testing for its CBDC interlinking solution, which it calls a connector. The project looked at four use cases, not all of which involved CBDC, according to the report it released on the test results. It experimented with digital trading with atomic (instantaneous) settlement using smart contracts. It connected tokenization platforms to facilitate atomic delivery versus payment and worked with financial infrastructure firm CLS Group to show the connector’s capability of connecting existing foreign exchange infrastructures using CBDC. SWIFT now plans to further develop the beta version of its connector.Before you go: Mastercard has released a white paper on remittances in Latin America, noting that remittance rates are growing faster than the global average in the region.

Buterin Looks Beyond Dencun as 'Blobscriptions' Raise L2 Fees - DailyCoin


        
Inscriptions on blobs are erasing the effects of the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.



Responding to the situation, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has outlined the next steps in the network’s scaling roadmap.



According to Buterin, the focus of scaling improvements is increasingly shifting to Layer 2 chains.
The Dencun upgrade has been hailed as a watershed moment for Ethereum‘s scalability for setting the groundwork for the network’s sharding roadmap and dramatically dropping fees on Layer 2 chains with the introduction of blobs.Less than a month after the upgrade, however, the visible effects of the Dencun upgrade have been all but reversed as inscriptions make their comeback on Ethereum Layer 2 chains. This time, this controversial practice of embedding data on the blockchain has been uniquely reimagined for blobs, earning the portmanteau word “blobscriptions.”The advent of these blobscriptions has highlighted the limitations of blobs in scaling Layer 2 chains: fees will rise with blob space demand. In light of recent events, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has explored what comes next in Ethereum’s scaling roadmap, highlighting that there is still more work to be done.Moving Ethereum Scaling From “One-to-N”In a blog post on Thursday, March 28, Buterin contended that following the introduction of blobs, scaling Ethereum was no longer a “zero-to-one” problem but a “one-to-N,” suggesting that the foundation had already been set. With this foundation in place, the developer argued that the focus was gradually shifting from addressing concerns on the Layer 1 chain to the Layer 2 chains.
Nonetheless, Buterin conceded that there was still work to be done in light of recent events. The developer highlighted that the next focus would be realizing data availability sampling (DAS). 
Traditionally, every node in a blockchain downloads the entire network dataset to verify it. However, this is cumbersome and a bottleneck for large chains like Ethereum. DAS has been proposed to lighten this workload performed by nodes by allowing network verification with only small random samples of the entire dataset. Buterin tipped DAS to improve blob space significantly, as nodes would only store a fraction of the blob.Following the implementation of DAS, the Ethereum co-founder disclosed that the scaling focus would shift to Layer 2 improvements to use the available data space better. Some of the recommendations made by Buterin included exploring data compression techniques and Plasma techniques, which only require data to be posted to the Layer 1 chain in exceptional situations. In addition to these, the developer recommended the improvement of execution-related constraints and overall security.On the Flipside
Despite the blobscription craze, Layer 2 fees remain far lower than fees on the Ethereum mainnet.



Proto-danksharding introduced with the Dencun upgrade is just the first step of Ethereum’s danksharding scaling roadmap.
Why This MattersThe statements from Vitalik Buterin suggest that Ethereum’s scaling roadmap is well underway with the Dencun upgrade despite recent hurdles with blobscriptions. At the same time, his statements outline the next steps to be taken to build on the success of the Dencun upgrade.Read this for more on the Dencun upgrade:Here’s Why Coinbase’s Base Metrics Are Booming Post-DencunStay up to date with the latest in the Binance-Nigeria debacle:Binance Exec Fights Nigeria Detention With Human Rights Suit

Bitcoin Halving is 21 Days Away - What Time Will It Happen and What to Expect? Here are the Answers - Bitcoin Sistemi

The fourth Bitcoin halving will take place on April 19, 2024, at approximately 16:30 Turkey time (UTC+3). According to Hashrate Index, this event could have significant impacts on Bitcoin's hashrate depending on BTC price performance.
Hashrate Index estimates that approximately 3-7% of Bitcoin hashrate could be out of action after the halving if Bitcoin's current price maintains or increases moderately. The year-end hashrate value for Bitcoin is expected to be between 639-674 EH/s.


However, if the price of Bitcoin falls from its current level to around $48,000, it is estimated that around 16% of Bitcoin hashrate could go offline.

The report indicates that there may be an anomaly in the upcoming halving compared to previous ones. The current Bitcoin bull market and transaction fee activity have provided many miners with the opportunity to remain viable after the block reward dropped to 3,125 BTC.





According to analysts, if Bitcoin's price stays here or increases, a small amount of hashrate could go offline. If the current trend continues, hashrate is expected to grow slowly over the next year. Compressed margins, exacerbated by the slow but steady increase in mining difficulty, will limit how much of the hashrate can come online and remain profitable.
While the halving will not disrupt miners to the extent previously imagined, margins will still be very thin after the event.


In summary, the BTC price must experience significant increases in order for existing miners to continue their operations profitably. Because when we look at the BTC production cost, it is known that this price will increase significantly.
In past years, halving has been the main factor that started the bull market in Bitcoin. BTC, which has already experienced a significant rise since the beginning of the year with this effect and ETF approval, is expected to enter a serious bull market by mid-2025.

Legal Team Seeks Leniency for OneCoin's Compliance Chief, Advocates for Time-Served Sentence



                    
In a recent legal move, John Buza, representing Irinia Dilkinska, the former “head of legal and compliance” for the infamous OneCoin cryptocurrency scheme, has sought leniency from a U.S. court. 



Dilkinska admitted to her involvement in the OneCoin fraud, pleading guilty to both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in November 2023. 




These admissions came as part of the fallout from the OneCoin scandal, a cryptocurrency operation unveiled as a sham in 2015, which bilked investors of an estimated $4 billion.



The request for leniency was made in a sentencing memorandum filed on March 20 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 



Buza’s plea centered on the argument that further incarceration for Dilkinska was unnecessary, citing her unique situation and the hardships she faces. 




“I respectfully submits that any sentence more than time-served would be greater that necessary,” Buza emphasized, advocating for a sentence of time served as fitting and appropriate given the circumstances.



Dilkinska’s involvement with OneCoin connected her with co-founders Karl Sebastian Greenwood and Ruja Ignatova, the latter notoriously dubbed the “Cryptoqueen.”

While Greenwood has been sentenced to 20 years in prison with a $300 million restitution order, Ignatova remains elusive, with her whereabouts unknown.



The gravity of Dilkinska’s potential sentence under U.S. law could lead to a decade behind bars, a fate already met by Mark Scott, another OneCoin lawyer found guilty of related charges and sentenced to 10 years in January. 



Ahead of Dilkinska’s sentencing, her defense submitted character letters, highlighting her exemplary behavior in detention and her importance as a family figure, to bolster their case for leniency.



In a related judgment, Konstantin Ignatov, brother of the still-absent Ignatova, received a sentence for time served after 34 months in custody, having pled guilty to money laundering and fraud in 2019. 



This precedent forms part of the context in which Dilkinska’s legal team seeks a similar outcome, arguing against the additional imprisonment for Dilkinska to avoid “a massive injustice,” as Buza stated, emphasizing her role as a “loving wife and mother.”

Bitcoin Runes Coming to Magic Eden After Ordinals Bet Pays Off - Decrypt

Cross-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden, which recently jumped to the top of the pack amid growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals, announced Friday that it plans to support the upcoming Runes fungible token standard on Bitcoin.“Ordinals, Rewards, Runes. The Future of BTC is on Magic Eden,” the marketplace tweeted along with a teaser video.The Rune protocol is set to launch on Bitcoin’s mainnet following the halving, which is expected to take place on April 20. The halving is the quadrennial event baked into the Bitcoin protocol that cuts in half the BTC miners receive for supporting the network. The move slows the expanding supply of Bitcoin, and typically also boosts the price of the asset.Runes is a fungible token standard from Casey Rodarmor, the Bitcoin developer who created the Ordinals protocol for inscribing media on the Bitcoin blockchain.While fungible tokens have been available on Bitcoin over the last year via the experimental BRC-20 token standard created on top of Ordinals, Runes is being pitched as a more efficient way of minting and trading tokens on Bitcoin."We think Runes is going to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem even further, opening up a new wave of builders and asset types previously only possible on other layer-1 chains,” Magic Eden co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Z Yin told Decrypt.“We have long-term conviction on native Bitcoin activity,” he continued. “It is a no-brainer for us to double down on this ecosystem by adding Runes to our existing Ordinals marketplace, which has already hit $1 billion in volume in 2024 alone."Earlier this year, Magic Eden launched its Diamonds rewards program across all its supported chains, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. The initiative gives NFT traders point-like Diamonds, both for past and ongoing trades, though it’s still unclear exactly how those Diamonds will benefit users.However, parallel to the Diamonds program, the Non-Fungible DAO—which Magic Eden says is run independently by an external team—plans to launch a fungible token called “NFT” that will be awarded to users of certain open-source trading and minting protocols. All such protocols revealed to date were created by Magic Eden.Amid the Diamonds launch and NFT token teases, along with rising interest in Bitcoin-based assets amid the leading cryptocurrency’s recent surge to all-time high prices, Magic Eden has quickly found fresh footing to become the top overall NFT marketplace by trading volume.Decrypt reported in early March that Bitcoin Ordinals demand had pushed Magic Eden to the top of the pile, with a 38% share of the entire NFT market’s volume in a 24-hour span based on public blockchain data curated by analytics platform Tiexo.That gap has only widened lately. Over the past 24 hours, Tiexo reports that Magic Eden is responsible for over 52% of total trading volume across chains with about $35.6 million worth—and Bitcoin Ordinals trades represent about 69% of that tally.Thursday’s buzzy launch of the Ink project on Bitcoin Ordinals appears to comprise a large chunk of that volume, with $18.8 million worth of transaction volume over the last 24 hours per the marketplace’s data.Over the last seven days, Magic Eden has remained on top—but the Ethereum-centric marketplace Blur has drawn closer during that span. Magic Eden has about 35.7% market share during that period, with Blur at about 32%. Tensor, which has long been Magic Eden’s biggest rival on Solana and plans to debut its own TNSR token soon, has about 7.5% total market share over the last week.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Is MATIC Ready for Lift-Off After Consolidation Phase?


The price of Polygon (MATIC) is witnessing a resurgence, indicated by a recovery in daily active addresses following steep declines. This uptick, supported by the RSI 7D, suggests potential for further buying that could boost MATIC’s price. 
However, caution is advised as EMA lines point towards ongoing consolidation, hinting at a less bullish outlook for MATIC in the near term. Investors should weigh these contrasting signals carefully.
Polygon Active Addresses Are Growing Again
Polygon (MATIC) experienced a significant milestone on March 14, when the number of daily active addresses soared to 3,301, coinciding with a price surge to $1.27, marking its highest value since February 2023. 
This peak reflects a strong correlation between MATIC’s price and its active user base, suggesting that higher engagement levels can drive up MATIC’s price.

However, a subsequent decline in daily active addresses to 2,550 by March 24 indicated a cooling period. Remarkably, from March 24 to March 28, the daily active addresses rebounded to 3,069, with the Daily Active Addresses 7D Moving Average indicating an uptrend. 

This recovery suggests a renewed interest in MATIC, potentially signaling an upcoming price increase. The relationship between active addresses and MATIC’s price is crucial, as rising user engagement often precedes positive price movements, providing a bullish outlook for investors and highlighting the platform’s growing adoption and utility.

RSI Shows Room For Growth
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for MATIC has seen a notable shift, currently positioned at 59, a decrease from 66 at its price peak on March 13 and down from 62 just two days ago. 
MATIC RSI 7D. Source: Santiment.
This decline in RSI, is a momentum oscillator that gauges the speed and change of price movements. This might signal a cooling period for MATIC’s previous bullish momentum. RSI values range from 0 to 100, with thresholds set at 70 for overbought conditions, indicating a potential price reversal. It also has a threshold of 30 for oversold conditions, suggesting a possible price increase. 

Given that MATIC’s RSI is now at 59, falling from higher values, it likely points towards a period of consolidation. This level suggests that MATIC is neither overbought nor oversold. This indicates that the price might stabilize in the short term as market participants assess its next directional move.
MATIC Price Prediction: EMA Lines Are Not Bullish
Despite the positive indicators from growing daily active addresses and a healthy RSI for MATIC, the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) lines present a less optimistic outlook. EMA lines, which are a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, are not aligning in a bullish pattern for MATIC price. 
Specifically, MATIC’s short-term EMA lines are situated below its long-term lines, and all are above the current price line. This configuration typically indicates a bearish sentiment, suggesting that the price is under pressure and could be expected to decline if current trends continue.

However, MATIC finds robust support at $0.95 and $0.90, hinting at potential consolidation around these levels from its current price. Should the market sentiment shift negatively, a downtrend could drive MATIC’s price down to $0.81. 
Conversely, a positive change in market dynamics might propel MATIC towards resistance levels at $1.17 and possibly $1.30 if sustained momentum is achieved.

Binance-Linked HKVAEX Withdraws Hong Kong License


																The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HKVAEX, reportedly associated with Binance, withdrew its license application from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) on March 28th.
HKVAEX announced its intention to apply for a license in October last year while clarifying that it operates as a distinct entity from Binance under BX Services Limited in Hong Kong.
However, there are shared resources between the companies, including the use of Binance servers for content retrieval, as indicated on the exchange’s website.
According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) website, HKVAEX withdrew its license application nearly three months after submission. Following this move, HKVAEX is required to shut down its operations in Hong Kong by May 31.
In recent years, Hong Kong has doubled down its efforts to establish itself as a hub of Web3, as part of which it introduced an updated regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in June 2023.




The revised rules enabled retail investors to engage in virtual asset trading, eliminating the previous requirement for traders to possess at least $1 million in bankable assets.
The SFC required all crypto exchange platforms intending to operate within the city-state to submit their applications before February 29th.
HKVAEX is not the only one to pull out. In 2024, three other virtual asset trading platforms also withdrew their operational license applications, including the well-known global exchange HTX (formerly known as Huobi).
Meanwhile, OSL and HashKey are currently the only two platforms that have received approval for their licenses from the SFC.

KuCoin Exits Hong Kong Amid US Regulatory Lawsuit


KuCoin’s Hong Kong subsidiary, HKVAEX, withdrew its application for a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license. 
This move reflects the intensifying regulatory scrutiny the cryptocurrency exchange faces globally. Notably, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) recently accused KuCoin of breaching money laundering regulations.
KuCoin Retracts From Hong Kong
This retreat from the licensing process in Hong Kong hints at a broader recalibration of KuCoin’s compliance efforts amidst mounting regulatory pressures. Industry insiders speculate that the decision to abandon the VASP license application could signal KuCoin’s intention to overhaul its approach to regulatory compliance.

“Three independent sources confirmed that KuCoin considered ceasing operations and selling the exchange in 2023. KuCoin was launched into criminal investigation by the US in 2023, and has also been subject to multiple investigations in China,” Chinese reporter Colin Wu said. 

Moreover, the exchange’s strategic pivot appears influenced by new enforcement actions by US regulatory bodies. These suggest a potential reassessment of KuCoin’s global operational stance. In light of the legal challenges, the anticipation of a possible rejection from Hong Kong regulators may have also played a role.

Commissioner Caroline D. Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) weighed in on the legal actions against KuCoin. In a statement, she highlighted the CFTC’s “aggressive enforcement” stance to protect US investors. 

“The CFTC has filed another aggressive enforcement action exercising our authority to pursue alleged unregistered crypto asset derivatives trading platforms and other violations of law. I commend the Division of Enforcement’s vigilance in protecting our markets,” Commissioner Pham said.

Following these enforcement actions, KuCoin’s reserves of ERC-20 tokens witnessed a dramatic 58% decrease. Indeed, KuCoin reserves plummeted from $1.22 billion to $710 million.

This stark decline reflects the immediate financial impact of the regulatory challenges KuCoin faces. It also emphasizes the exchange’s urgent need to navigate the evolving regulatory environment carefully.
