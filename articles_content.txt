Strong Gains for Injective (INJ): Key Price Levels to Observe


Injective (INJ) has demonstrated a strong 24-hour performance, gaining 17% in the last 24 hours. 
This surge raises the question: Can INJ recover from the 65% drawdown from its all-time high?
Injective Technical Analysis: Testing Key Levels
The Injective price has approached or tested the daily Ichimoku cloud, which is a very bullish sign. The size of the cloud highlights the significance of this level.

Key resistance levels in the mid-to-long term are $29.5, $34, $38.4, and $43. If the daily Ichimoku cloud breaks on INJ, it could witness a price appreciation toward $33. Additionally, if Bitcoin’s price reaches back to $73,000, the price could easily increase by another 18% in the mid-term.
Correlation with Bitcoin: INJ has shown a notable correlation with Bitcoin, standing at 0.6. This suggests that movements in Bitcoin’s price significantly impact INJ. If Bitcoin continues its upward movement and reaches $73,000, we can expect INJ to trade between $30 and $34.

Strategic Recommendations and Price Projections
Bullish to Neutral Outlook:

Target Level at $29.5: If the price enters the daily Ichimoku cloud, the initial target is $29.5. This level serves as a significant resistance.
Major Price Appreciation: A break above $29.5 could trigger major price appreciation, with potential targets at $34, $38.4, and potentially reclaiming $40.
Downside Risk: If the price tests the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud and fails to hold, it could lead to an exit to the downside, negating the bullish probability and leading to further declines.

SEC asks updated spot Ethereum ETF filings from US exchanges: Report - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges that would list spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US to update their filings, said Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, to Reuters.“Opposing the ETH ETF after the BTC one was approved always seemed like an odd case for the SEC to try to push, unless they were willing to open up questions on Ethereum’s securities status more broadly, and it’s likely that the call has come in somewhere to not take that fight,” added Edwards.To Reuters, an SEC spokesperson said they did not comment on individual filings.On May 20, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%, mentioning that the US regulator is motivated by “political issues.”This development was enough to raise ETH’s price by 22.5% in the last 24 hours and also propelled the crypto market as a whole.The SEC has two decisions on spot Ethereum ETFs this week related to filings from VanEck and ARK Investment Management. As it happened with spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, analysts expect a blanket approval, which means that if the regulator gives the green light, all spot Ethereum ETFs will have permission to be traded in the country.Close to an all-time highBitcoin raised 96% within two months before its first spot ETF approval in the US and registered different all-time highs in the two following months after the SEC permitted this investment product trading.At the time of writing, Ethereum is 23% away from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. If a similar move ensues, ETH might hit a new price peak at the beginning of Q3.However, due to the market expectations around the Ethereum ETF, a refusal from the SEC might have a significantly negative impact on the crypto market.

Ethereum ($ETH) Price Soars Nearly 20% as Crypto Market Cap Surges by $200 Billion | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) has surged past the $71,000 mark in a cryptocurrency market rally that saw Ethereum’s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, skyrocket nearly 20% while the total market cap of the space grew by over $200 billion.



The sudden move came as Bitcoin broke through the $65,000 mark earlier this week after being range-bound after its highly-anticipated halving event, which cut the coinbase reward miners receive per block found in half.



The rally extended to several other major cryptocurrencies, with Binance’s BNB moving up 7.7% in the last 24 hours, XRP moving up 5.5%, and DOGE moving up nearly 8% over the same period, among others.



Total Crypto Market Cap Chart via TradingView



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

House Democrats Challenge Bill on Digital Asset Regulation


							

Maxine Waters and David Scott have opposed the FIT21 crypto bill.



The lawmakers emailed their colleagues to explain their reason for opposing the bill.



They believe FIT21 will shield crypto entities from‌ securities laws, rules, and regulations.




Two senior House Democrats, Representatives Maxine Waters and David Scott, have voiced opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). In emails to fellow Democrats, they expressed concerns that the bill could disrupt existing regulations and weaken investor protections. However, a report by Politico noted they did not whip their members against the bill.



The FIT21 Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets by clarifying how these assets are classified and overseen. It proposes expanding the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regulating certain digital assets.



However, Reps. Waters and Scott argue that the bill undermines established legal principles and creates uncertainty within the traditional securities market. A portion of their email states:




“This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.”




The lawmakers further point to a section of the bill that allows entities to file an “intent to register” under specific conditions. They believe this could shield such entities from existing securities regulations while the SEC and CFTC develop new rules.









According to the email, the ranking lawmakers fear that the new bill will weaken investor protection and open the door to fraud and market manipulation. They consider it a “not fit for purpose act.”



Proponents of the bill, including a coalition of industry organizations and companies such as Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, argue that FIT21 provides much-needed regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry.

This Is Why Ethereum Meme Coins Are Soaring: PEPE, MOG Lead


The anticipation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US has triggered a remarkable surge in Ethereum-based meme coins. 
Over the past 24 hours, several tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem have experienced significant gains, fueled by heightened investor interest and optimism.
Pepe and Mogcoin Skyrocket

Ethereum meme coins, often viewed as high-risk, high-reward assets, have become a popular way to bet on the network’s growth. They are considered a leveraged bet during Ethereum rallies. 
This phenomenon was observed recently when two Bloomberg analysts increased the likelihood of ETH ETF approval. Consequently, the Ethereum ecosystem tokens surged.

Pepe (PEPE), one of the most notable Ethereum meme coins, is trading near its all-time high, soaring over 17% in just 24 hours. PEPE is known for its volatility and potential for outsized gains, making it a favorite among speculative investors.
Another standout performer is Mogcoin (MOG), which has skyrocketed by nearly 45% over the same period. Amid these developments, the story of mogillionaire.eth, an Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) address, has captivated the crypto community. 
In July 2023, mogillionaire.eth invested 8.8 ETH, equivalent to $16,000 at the time, to acquire 3.37 trillion MOG tokens. 

“Fortunately, 7 months later, his dream came true, and he became a millionaire on Feb 27, 2024. The 3.37 trillion MOG was worth more than $4 million at the peak and is currently worth $2.83 million,” on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain said.

While PEPE and MOG have grabbed headlines with their impressive gains, other Ethereum-based tokens have also performed well. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), though not matching the explosive growth of PEPE and MOG, have still posted increases of nearly 7% and 10%, respectively.

The surge extends beyond meme coins. Arbitrum (ARB), another Ethereum-based token, has climbed by 25%. 
Additionally, Lido DAO (LDO) has seen a remarkable 33% increase. These gains reflect a broader bullish sentiment within the Ethereum ecosystem, driven by the potential ETF approval and the network’s ongoing development.

Hong Kong-based Crypto Custody Hex Trust Announces the Release of a New Stablecoin! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hex Trust Group, a leading crypto custodian based in Hong Kong, has launched USDX, the first native stablecoin on the layer-1 blockchain Flare.
Hex Trust Releases First Native Stablecoin on Layer-1 Blockchain Flare
This stablecoin is backed 1:1 by US dollars or equivalent assets and can be staked on the Flare blockchain.


The launch of USDX is set to enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on Flare by providing new opportunities for users and developers.
The stablecoin will be integrated into various lending protocols and exchanges and will also have a staking mechanism in a private T-Pool created by Clearpool, a decentralized lending marketplace.





Users who stake USDX will receive cUSDX in return, which can be used as collateral in DeFi protocols on the Flare network. This integration aims to provide a stable, yield-generating asset for the Flare ecosystem.
“USDX and Clearpool's collaboration on Flare delivers a stable asset with 1:1 backing that provides instant access to real-world returns,” said Hugo Philion, co-founder of Flare.


This will be particularly useful for FAsset brokers and will work even when their stable collateral is locked in the system,” he said.

Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, highlighted the benefits of USDX, stating that it will help “reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency market” and “facilitate transactions.”





The launch of USDX marks a significant milestone for Flare as it continues to develop its DeFi capabilities.
Earlier this year, Flare raised $35 million in a private financing round from investors including Kenetic and Aves Lair. According to DeFiLlama, the blockchain currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $8 million.
This new development underscores Flare's commitment to expanding its ecosystem and providing robust financial tools for its users. With the launch of USDX, Flare is poised to attract more participants and significantly increase DeFi activity.

Standard Chartered anticipates spot Ethereum ETFs approval this week - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Standard Chartered expects SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs this week.
The bank predicted inflows of $15-45 billion that could drive ETH price to $8,000 by the end of 2024.
Ether’s price has surged 19% in the past 24 hours, reflecting the optimism in the market.

Standard Chartered expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve Ethereum (ETH) ETFs this week.
If it happens, it could herald a substantial influx of capital into the ether market, with projections estimating inflows between $15 billion and $45 billion in the first 12 months post-approval.
The critical ether ETFs proposal deadlines
The SEC is approaching critical deadlines for several ether ETF proposals, with VanEck’s submission due on May 23 and Ark Invest/21Shares’ on May 24.
Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, stated that the approval of spot ether ETFs could drive significant market activity, with anticipated inflows ranging from 2.39 million to 9.15 million ether.
Kendrick emphasized that these inflows, as a percentage of market capitalization, are comparable to those seen with bitcoin ETFs, which have proven to be accurate predictors of market behaviour.
Ethereum (ETH) price forecasts
In light of this, Standard Chartered has reiterated its ambitious price target for Ethereum (ETH), forecasting it to reach $8,000 by the end of 2024. This projection is based on maintaining the current 5.4% price ratio between ether and bitcoin, with bitcoin itself expected to hit $150,000 by year-end.
The bank’s outlook extends even further, predicting that by the end of 2025, Ethereum (ETH) price could soar to $14,000, assuming Bitcoin reaches a staggering $200,000.
These optimistic targets underscore the potential impact that ETF approvals could have on the broader cryptocurrency market.
SEC requested updates to the 19b-4 spot Ethereum ETFs filings
The momentum towards approval gained additional support on Monday when the SEC requested updates to the 19b-4 filings for spot ether ETFs.
This move suggests progress, albeit without guaranteeing approval. However, the likelihood of approval has been bolstered significantly.
As a result of the SEC’s move, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas increased their approval probability estimates from 25% to 75%.

Update: @JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied). See… https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om
— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024

Reflecting the growing optimism, Ethereum’s price surged over 19% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3,782.68 as of 12:28 P.m. ET on May 21.
The broader cryptocurrency market also reacted positively, with the GM 30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies, rising by 9.25% to 148.75.

Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend


																In a noteworthy development for Shiba Inu investors and traders, well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Javon Marks has verified SHIB’s break out from the Bull Flag pattern, an indicator that typically signals the start of an upward price movement.
Shiba Inu Breakout To Trigger A Continuation 210% Price Increase
Mark’s emphasis delves into the current bullish momentum surrounding Shiba Inu, which has caused traders and investors in the meme coin market to feel optimistic once again, indicating that the crypto asset could be positioned for more gains.

According to the expert, SHIB has now exited a smaller Bull Flag-like pattern, and it is currently holding above it. This breakout appears to be significant as Javon Marks noted that it could start another major wave in an already enormous run on the upside.

Specifically, this lesser break can trigger a continuation in an over 210% (3X) run to $0.000081 from the $0.0000254 level, provided that the larger breakout also holds. In addition, should Shiba Inu surpass the $0.000081 level, it might be poised for an additional 90% increase to the $0.0001553 mark.
The post read:
With a larger breakout also holding, this smaller break can initiate a continuation in an over 210% run to the $0.000081 target which is more than 3X from here. A break above $0.000081 and SHIB may just be set for another +90% move to $0.0001553.
The analyst further drew attention to his previous forecasts, in which he predicted a run to the $0.000081 price level. He previously noted that Shiba Inu has made a strong comeback and appears to be primed for yet another huge surge towards the $0.000081 target.
Thus, given the progressive breakout from the resisting trend, another 141% upside move to hit the aforementioned price target may not be far off. Also, following price declines, SHIB will garner strength to reach the level and move even higher to $0.0001553.
Pullbacks To Buttress The Move
Javon Mark affirms that since SHIB’s break out from the resisting trend, it has increased by over 129%, suggesting that a run is well within reach. At this point, Marks claims that as long as current prices maintain their breakout, pullbacks might only enhance these prices. Additionally, an extra 252% price increase toward $0.000081 will be aided by these pullbacks.

	Related Reading



It is important to note that the analyst’s prediction began when SHIB ended a 441-day downtrend in September last year. Given the significance of the development, Marks believed SHIB was about to surge, putting his target at $0.000081, a 975% rise from $0.0000074.
As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000257, demonstrating over 6% growth in the past day. Both its market cap and trading volume have also attracted significant gains of about 6.83% and 147%, respectively.

Monster whale activity to watch for these 2 cryptocurrencies


    The cryptocurrency market has started this week dominated by a bullish sentiment, with most cryptocurrencies accruing gains. This recent price action has attracted the interest of crypto whales, reaching short-term record highs.



In particular, an insight from Santiment shows Optimism (OP) and Chiliz (CHZ) with rising whale activity on May 20. However, despite a seemingly positive metric, Santiment‘s analyst, Brian Q, believes this could foreshadow volatility and trend reversals.




“With crypto rebounding big today, keep an eye on the rising whale activity among many altcoins like Optimism and Chiliz. Sudden high onchain activity among their largest traders typically will foreshadow major volatility and OP & CHZ reversals.”
– Brian Q, for Santiment








Notably, the chart shows 392 and 46 whale transaction counts for OP and CHZ, respectively. This category includes all transactions worth $100,000 or more registered on the Ethereum (ETH) and Optimism networks.



OP and CHZ $100k+ whale transactions. Source: Santiment / Sanbase Pro



How does whale activity correlate to price?



Essentially, cryptocurrencies moving on the blockchain usually means one of these three things:



One, someone has purchased these amounts in a cryptocurrency exchange, withdrawing to a self-custody wallet. Two, Someone wants to sell these amounts and is depositing to an exchange for that intent. Or, three, someone is making a wallet-to-wallet transaction either for themselves or for someone else.



However, the first two are the most common activities— buying or selling, while withdrawing or depositing.



On that note, withdrawing activity is retroactive, meaning the whale has already bought the tokens and influenced their price. Meanwhile, if spotted in time, depositing can forecast further price impacts as the assets are yet to be sold.



Therefore, high whale activity could sometimes foreshadow volatility and reversals, although not guaranteed.



Optimism (OP) and Chiliz (CHZ) price analysis



As of this writing, OP was trading at $2.92 per token, up nearly 20% in a month, while CHZ was trading at $0.124, up 7.6% in the same period.

Notably, Optimism is currently testing a price resistance in the monthly chart, while CHZ has broken out of resistance in the weekly chart and heading toward key zones in the higher time frame.



This suggests that, if Santiment’s analyst is right, these assets could experience increased volatility and likely retrace at any moment. Nevertheless, the market is unpredictable, and everything can happen in the short term for these cryptocurrencies.

Web3 Gaming Token GALA Crashes After $240M Exploit - The Defiant

The price of GALA dropped 20% to $0.038 from $0.047 on Tuesday morning.
Gala Games, a popular web3 gaming network, is reeling after a hacker breached its smart contracts and minted a massive sum of GALA tokens.The attack triggered a 20% plunge in the price of GALA to $0.038 from roughly $0.047, according to CoinGecko.A hacker exploited the smart contract for the GALA token and minted tokens worth $240 million.While the attacker was able to sell roughly 600 million tokens worth $21 million via the decentralized exchange Uniswap, Gala Games moved quickly to freeze the remaining 4.4 billion GALA.Rogue Admin"Our ETH contract for $GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet,” Gala CEO Eric Schiermeyer said . “It was never compromised."Schiermeyer also took responsibility for the incident, stating that Gala had made mistakes with its internal control.“This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again," he said.The breach was first identified by Solidity developer 0xQuit.“A compromised or rogue Gala Games admin address minted 5 Billion $GALA ($200M) and has been systematically selling the tokens for the past 2 hours,” they tweeted.Hacker IdentifiedGala Games’ CEO noted the project has identified the culprit and are currently working with authorities.Regarding daily distribution, Schiermeyer said there will be a vote to decide how to handle this matter, emphasizing that the community will decide how they proceed.In this context, "daily distribution" refers to the regular release of GALA tokens to network participants, such as node operators and users, as rewards for their contributions.Schiermeyer noted that the frozen 4.4 billion tokens can be considered "effectively burned," meaning they cannot be transferred or accessed and are therefore considered destroyed.The price of GALA has since rebounded to around $0.041. This recovery is partly due to a broader market rally, with Ethereum experiencing a 20% surge.Dominant in GameFiGala Games holds a dominant position in the GameFi ecosystem on Ethereum, capturing over 60% of the user base according to data from Dune Analytics. In comparison, The Sandbox follows with 25% of the users, and Axie Infinity comes in third with 11%.Gala Games has a 60-person team and boasts more than 1.3 million active users worldwide, according to a CoinMarketCap 2021 research report. Some popular titles within the Gala Games ecosystem include Mirandus, Spider Tank, Town Star, Fortified, and Echoes of Empire.The GALA token is integral to the Gala Games ecosystem, serving as a medium for in-game purchases, rewarding node operators, and enabling governance through voting on platform decisions.

How Bitcoin ETFs Are Changing the Risk-Reward Ratio for Institutional Investors

Prior to FTX, a lot of people put those risks aside and focus on price appreciation and gaining access to the market. Post FTX, people are saying, I want to be involved, but I need to know I'm protected at a basic level. The ETFs do that, while exposing institutional investors to the reliant counterparties in crypto. They’ve put the industry back on a positive track.

Sui Sets New Standard for Blockchain Transaction Speeds



                    
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 21st, 2024, Chainwire


Set to hit Mainnet this summer, Sui’s new Mysticeti protocol cuts consensus latency down to 390 ms.
Sui, the pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that offers industry-leading performance and infinite horizontal scaling, today announced the successful deployment of Mysticeti, its latest consensus protocol, on Sui Testnet. This significant breakthrough reduces consensus time on Sui’s public Testnet by 80 percent at 390 milliseconds while maintaining the protocol’s industry-leading throughput. This impressive demonstration confirms that Sui is the fastest consensus layer in the industry.
Developed from deep research into Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms, Mysticeti represents a significant advancement from Narwhal-Bullshark, the consensus algorithms Sui launched into its Mainnet a year ago, achieving unprecedented transaction speeds and reducing CPU requirements for validators. This enhancement extends Sui’s impressive low latency performance to all transaction types across the network.
Sui’s uniquely object-oriented architecture enables the network to process transactions differently based on the characteristics of the transaction and the objects involved. On Sui, transactions involving only “owned objects”, such as peer-to-peer transfers, do not require consensus. Instead, they follow a fast-path execution that can be completed in a shorter time. In contrast, transactions involving the same shared object, for example, transactions involving marketplaces, auctions or collaborative game assets, do require consensus. In the past, that meant more processing latencies. Mysticeti changes that, by processing shared object transactions using an optimized version of BFT consensus. The Mysticeti design involves minimal cross-validator communication and fully takes advantage of network bandwidth in order to maintain high throughput.
“Mysticeti represents a major leap forward, not just for Sui but for blockchain technology as a whole,” said George Danezis, Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Mysten Labs which originated the Sui Network and pioneer of global research on BFT consensus. “It reduces consensus latency to what we understand to be its lower limits while retaining the benefits of high capacity and low computation cost. It also allows transaction processing faster than consensus within the same protocol, a feature unique to Sui. Mysticeti is yet another instance of Sui pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve.”
Results on Testnet have been remarkable, demonstrating the capability to commit transactions with an 80% reduction in latency compared to Narwhal. The enhancement implemented by Mysticeti significantly decreases complexity and optimizes resource use, allowing the Sui network to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second with latencies well below one second.
These advancements are critical as Sui continues to cement its position at the pinnacle of blockchain speed and scale, and provide a seamless experience for developers and users at scale. 
“Mysticeti’s launch is the result of a successful collaboration between research, engineering, and our validator community,” said Dmitri Perelman, Head of Engineering at Mysten Labs. “The lessons we learned from building and tuning previous-generation consensus in production provided the context and inspiration for the researchers to come up with the new protocol. After the first Mysticeti prototype demonstrated undeniable performance superiority, the engineering team was fully onboard and the next-gen consensus implementation is being rolled out to Mainnet with the support of validators in a matter of months.”
Kevin Nelson, Co-Founder of Aftermath Finance said, “With Mysticeti, Mysten has proven that the DAG-based structure can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both consensus throughput and, importantly, latency. At Aftermath, we are excited to see Mysticeti roll out on testnet and even more excited for when it will touch the hands of our users with its release on Mainnet. Moreover, we are looking forward to taking advantage of Mysticeti’s new design to provide a better end-to-end experience on Aftermath.”
Greg Siourounis, Sui Foundation Managing Director added, “Low latency and fast transaction speeds have always been fundamental to Sui’s value as a top choice for builders, and with Mysticeti, the developer experience gets even better. This breakthrough once again showcases an ongoing and relentless focus on innovation, unlocking new possibilities for the types and quality of decentralized applications that can be built on Sui.”
The key innovations of Mysticeti are detailed in the newly published paper, “Mysticeti: Low-Latency DAG Consensus with Fast Commit Path,” which shows the scalability of this new technology and is available for review.

‘Nvidia of crypto’ targets $20 ahead of earnings call


    With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sphere recording a bullish streak, things are looking up for one specific artificial intelligence (AI) token, popularly known as the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ as well, which is eyeing significant gains as an important earnings call awaits.



Specifically, Render (RNDR), often referred to as the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ due to its specialization and explosive growth similar to that of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), is targeting $20, according to the observations shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst D0c Crypto in an X post on May 21.



Render price prediction 2024



Indeed, the crypto expert also pointed out that Render’s stochastic relative strength index (RSI) is demonstrating oversold conditions “on the weekly,” adding that Nvidia’s first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, which many expect to be exceedingly positive, is launching on May 22, possibly triggering the “AI season 3.0.”

For now, Renders is changing hands at the price of $11.04, suggesting an increase of 8.16% in the last 24 hours, as well as an 8.57% advance across the previous seven days, as it accumulates a gain of 23.45% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data on May 21.

Notably, Nvidia has long positioned itself as the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), while the Render crypto asset belongs to a decentralized GPU network aiming to disrupt the rapidly growing market for 3D rendering in virtual worlds, augmented reality (AR), and the metaverse.



Ultimately, thanks to its mission and continuous efforts, the ‘Nvidia of crypto’ might, indeed, proceed towards its next price target at $20 and continue beyond, but caution is necessary, and doing one’s own research is critical when investing, as things in the cryptoverse can sometimes change on a whim.

Angel investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who is also a renowned Bitcoin supporter, has published a tweet about his take on the impact that an approval of the Ethereum ETF is likely to have.In the meantime, according to a recent report, the odds of the regulator approving spot Ethereum ETFs have increased to 75%. Still, not all cryptocurrency influencers expect these ETFs to get the green light."The last dam to be broken" for cryptoProminent Bitcoin advocate Pompliano, who holds BTC and has launched several business projects in the crypto space, tweeted that if the SEC decides to issue a positive decision on the spot Ethereum ETF after all, in that case they will be “approving the entire industry.”After spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds got approved in January after many months of waiting, he pointed out that the potential approval of the ETFs based on Ethereum is “the last dam to be broken” for the crypto space to be entirely embraced by Wall Street. Several companies, including Ark Invest, BlackRock, VanEck and Grayscale (who wants to convert their Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF), filed submissions for spot funds based on Ethereum after their Bitcoin ETFs were allowed to start trading.Many crypto influencers have been watching this situation. They have split into those who believe the SEC will approve the ETFs and those who do not believe it will happen this year. Dogecoin cofounder Billy Markus belongs to the latter. On Monday, he shared his take on the X platform. Odds of ETFs approval surge high, Ethereum soarsAccording to a recent tweet published by the Santiment on-chain data aggregator, Bloomberg analysts have made another assessment of the Ethereum ETF situation and have published a positive outcome. Now, per the report, chances for the spot ETFs to be allowed to launch have increased to 75% after staying at 25%.This has provoked the immediate growth of Ethereum, pushing the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market above the $3,650 level for the first time since April 9. At the time of writing this, Ethereum is changing hands at $3,735 upon demonstrating a whopping 20.7% price jump. Still, there is also a risk that the SEC may label Ethereum a security.

Crypto Experts Predict New ETH Price Targets With Ethereum ETF Approval News


This article was paid for*
The Ethereum price is undergoing a significant bullish repricing, following the dramatic surge in the odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval on Monday. 
Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas backtracked from their pessimistic outlook, now projecting a 75% likelihood that the SEC will greenlight the spot ETH ETFs on May 23rd. 

In response, the Ethereum price printed its biggest green candle ever, rallying 20% to trade above $3,700.

Experts project ETH to continue its bullish trajectory, both before and after a potential spot ETF approval. 
Why Spot Ethereum ETF Approval is Now a Strong Possibility?
Most crypto market participants have been caught unawares with the sudden turn of events in the spot Ethereum ETF approval saga. 
Even with BlackRock being one of the applicants, the market had fully priced in a rejection from the SEC, with ETH trading as low as $2,880 last Tuesday. 
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart remained decidedly pessimistic just 3 days ago, stating on X, “It’s just not happening guys. Sorry”. Meanwhile, his colleague Eric Balchunas called the measured optimism from Coinbase a “risk-free PR move”.

However, there may have been a few indications regarding this oncoming shift in expectations. For instance, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez reported that crypto whales purchased over $341 million worth of ETH in 24 hours. 

Such conviction could have indicated two possibilities – either the whales believed that the spot Ethereum ETF rejection is fully priced in or that the SEC may surprise investors with an approval. 
Balchunas and Seyffart have since bumped the odds up to 75%, citing the fact that spot Ethereum ETF approval has become an increasingly political issue. 
Indeed, other experts have highlighted that a rejection from the SEC would not bode well for US President Joe Biden in an election year, given Donald Trump’s openly pro-crypto stance. 
Crypto Experts Predict New ETH Price Targets
The market had largely expected the SEC to reject all spot ETH ETF applications, resulting in Ethereum adopting a bearish stance.
The second largest cryptocurrency is now repricing, with experts projecting it to continue its bullish trajectory in the coming weeks. 
Analyst Miles Deutscher expects Ethereum to trade near the $6,500 mark, considering that the Bitcoin price rallied over 75% after its spot ETF approval. 

However, crypto influencer That Martini Guy projects ETH to hit $10,000 in the aftermath of spot Ethereum ETF approval.

Analyst Nebraskangooner highlights that ETH has broken out of a bullish cup and handle pattern, with a long-term price target of over $11,000. 
Ethereum Meme Coins Set to Explode
Meme coins remain highly correlated to their respective native tokens during this bull cycle. Experts are already gearing up for Ethereum meme coins to explode next once the spot ETH ETFs are approved. 
For instance, analysts such as Michael Wrubel and Jacob Bury believe that WienerAI – a new ERC-20 meme coin – has 100x upside potential and could be one of the best crypto to invest in 2024. 

$WAI is no ordinary meme coin. As the name suggests, the token offers cutting-edge AI utility, allowing its token holders to gain an edge in crypto trading. From MEV protection to enabling seamless swap, the WienerAI trading bot is designed to be the perfect companion for investors, especially during a bull market. 
$WAI has its own staking pool as well, which has a current reward rate of 400%,
It’s therefore not surprising that the WienerAI presale has already raised close to $2.5 million in the first few weeks. 
Interested buyers can still visit the wienerdog.ai presale website and utilize the over-the-counter widget to purchase the meme coin.

Hex Trust Group launches, USDX, the first native stablecoin on Flare Network - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Hex Trust launches USDX, the first native stablecoin on Flare, backed 1:1 by USD.
USDX can be staked in Clearpool’s T-Pool for real-world yield without lock-ups.
USDX aims to enhance Flare’s DeFi ecosystem, supporting lending and borrowing.

Hong Kong-based digital asset custodian, Hex Trust Group, has launched USDX, the first native stablecoin on the Flare network.
The move by Hex Trust Group will bolster the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Flare, a layer-1 blockchain tailored for data-intensive applications.
USDX stablecoin by HT Digital Assets
USDX, developed by HT Digital Assets, Hex Trust’s tokenization ecosystem, is a stablecoin backed 1:1 against the U.S. dollar or equivalently valued assets.
The stablecoin’s reserves primarily consist of 1-3 month Treasury Bills, held securely by regulated tier-1 financial institutions, ensuring stability and trust in the stablecoin’s value.
The stablecoin is designed to serve as a fundamental building block for DeFi on the Flare blockchain. It will be available for various applications, such as lending and borrowing protocols, as well as perpetual futures exchanges.
USDX’s integration with Clearpool
While launching the USDX stablecoin, Hex Trust Group also announced a strategic partnership with Clearpool, a decentralized credit marketplace.
Through this collaboration, USDX holders can stake their tokens in a dedicated T-Pool created by Clearpool.
This innovative staking mechanism allows users to earn real-world yields without the constraints of lock-up periods.
In return for staking USDX, users receive cUSDX tokens, which can be utilized as collateral across DeFi protocols on the Flare network, including Flare Labs’ FAsset system. This system supports the use of non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in DeFi applications.
Market impact and future prospects
Hex Trust’s CEO, Alessio Quaglini, emphasized that the launch of USDX will reduce cryptocurrency market volatility and streamline transactions. He highlighted that USDX bridges the gap between traditional financial security and blockchain innovation, enhancing trust and security within the digital asset ecosystem.
In addition, Hugo Philion, the Co-Founder of Flare, remarked on the essential role of stablecoins in developing a vibrant DeFi ecosystem and noted that the collaboration between USDX and Clearpool on Flare delivers a stable, yield-generating asset that will greatly benefit the network’s users.
Jakob Kronbichler, the CEO & Co-founder of Clearpool, also weighed in on the launch stating that the launch of a custom T-Pool for USDX on Flare provides everyday users with opportunities to earn real-world yield from their stable holdings.

MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Reacts as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Hits $71,000

Bitcoin (BTC), the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, neared $72,000 during the Tuesday trading session, reaching intraday highs of $71,980. The largest cryptocurrency asset extended its surge from Monday's session, when its price increased from $66,057 to $71,560, its highest level since early April. Crypto prices rose on hints of progress toward U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Ethereum, a departure from a more pessimistic outlook last week.The market-moving ETF speculation is reminiscent of the investor excitement that greeted comparable U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, whose January debut fueled a rally in the largest digital asset to a record high.Amid this euphoria, Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, took to X with an intriguing yet compelling message: "Escape the Matrix." This tweet comes at a time when the crypto market is witnessing an epic rally, with Bitcoin nearing its current all-time highs.  At the time of writing, BTC was up 6.28% in the last 24 hours to 6.28% and up 16% in the last seven days. At current prices, Bitcoin is just 3.45% away from its all-time high of $73,350, reached in mid-March. Literally, escaping the matrix means shedding all forms of outside influence to determine what you truly want deep in your soul.Saylor's call to "Escape the Matrix" resonates with the growing positive sentiment on the crypto market. The "matrix" could reflect the previously imposed limitations, including external influences.Bitcoin's price has been largely influenced by macroeconomic developments in recent weeks, dropping to a low of $56,903 on May 2 before recovering. While Saylor's tweet remains subject to interpretation, "Escape the Matrix" could be more than just a catchphrase; it could be a call to action for individuals who want to push the bounds of what seems conceivable.

Ethereum ETF Applicants Ditch Staking Language in 'Temporary Concession' to SEC: Analyst - Decrypt

As the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mulls applications for spot Ethereum ETFs—with analysts expecting approval as soon as this week—amended filings from several asset managers have dropped their language around staking.Staking refers to the process through which users delegate Ethereum tokens to the network in exchange for rewards. It became a core component of Ethereum’s security model with the network’s long-planned shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022.Fidelity dropped language regarding the staking of customer funds in its proposed ETF, submitting an amended filing on Tuesday. The measure mirrored a similar move made by Ark Invest/21 Shares, which erased staking mentions earlier this month from its application, which the SEC is due to decide on this week.“Spot Ethereum ETF filers bent the knee by removing staking language to appease a recently humbled SEC,” 3iQ Head Of Research Mark Connors told Decrypt. “We see the removal of staking language as a temporary concession.”If spot Ethereum ETFs get a regulatory green light, then that could mean a significant portion of Ethereum’s supply rests idled in any approved funds. As of this writing, about 27% of Ethereum’s supply—or 32 million ETH—is staked, according to a Dune dashboard.Though the SEC appears open to approving spot Ethereum ETFs, as the regulator engages meaningfully with asset managers, staking has emerged as a contentious aspect of Ethereum over the past two years. In lawsuits, the regulator has alleged that Ethereum staking services constitute securities offerings on behalf of several firms.SEC Chair Gary Gensler spoke specifically about staking services in an agency video a year ago, arguing that investors deserve certain disclosures on how crypto is handled by companies when staked, such as if funds are commingled.In other regions, such as Canada, funds that hold staked Ethereum have shown that it can be done. Two of 3iQ’s exchange-traded products, for example, began offering customers the benefits of Ethereum staking in 2023.Connors said the change in the SEC’s posture must be due to political pressure the agency faces over SAB 121, a crypto-custody rule that lawmakers voted last week to erase.“The SEC’s regulation by enforcement method is clearly under assault,” he said.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Tech centibillionaire Elon Musk has announced a major new milestone achieved by one of his largest and oldest companies – SpaceX.The community on the X platform, which also belongs to him, responded immediately, congratulating the hard working CEO. Among them were also crypto-themed accounts that made allegations about SpaceX’s crypto holdings going up in the future."SpaceX's crypto clearly going to moon"In his tweet, the innovative entrepreneur, Musk, sent congratulations to the SpaceX team on its major new record – three million customers in 99 countries on the planet. Musk also extended his gratitude to SpaceX customers for buying Starlink.Recently, as was announced by Elon Musk, this space-internet connection became available in Indonesia. Musk paid a visit to Bali as part of the promotion campaign.Crypto user @XRPcryptowolf tweeted that he expects crypto held by SpaceX to go to moon. It is widely known that SpaceX holds Bitcoin and Dogecoin. As of March 1, SpaceX and Tesla together hold $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, with more than half a million U.S. dollars in profits after the bull run that took place back then. As for DOGE, this is is the only cryptocurrency both SpaceX and Tesla accept for their merchandise in online shops. Elon Musk makes "Black Mirror" warningEarlier today, Musk commented on the recent AI innovation presented by the Microsoft Corporation to the public. It is a new feature added to the Copilot + PC, named “Recall.”The new feature will create photographic memories for users, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims. It will take screenshots of all user activity on a PC and then process it with AI. Users will be able to search through this archive later on, according to the idea.Elon Musk responded, saying that this really looks like “a Black Mirror” episode – a popular TV series about possible dystopian futures and the dominating role of technologies. Musk tweeted that he will certainly switch this feature off. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also questioned the point behind the creation of this feature, assuming that people would hardly want to use it.  Nadella, though, assumed everyone that Recall will operate locally and will not transfer personal user data from their PCs.

Shibarium on Verge of Major Record as Transactions Shoot up 209%

Shibarium, the layer-2 scaling solution associated with the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, is reacting positively to the new uptrend on the market. Over a period of seven days, the total transaction count on Shibarium jumped from 6,000 on May 14 to 18,560 as of May 20. This jump accounts for over a 209% surge.Shibarium is a unique blockchain protocol with a thriving community around it. For weeks, the Shibarium transaction count stayed relatively flat, however, the tides shifted when the Shiba Inu team launched the Shibarium hard fork on the mainnet. This marked a turnaround for the Ethereum L2 protocol.With the transaction boom, Shibarium is now eyeing breaking the 420 million total transaction record. While the timeline to achieve this is currently uncertain, Shibarium has the right catalyst to help it drive its position to a new level overall.Following the launch of the Shibarium hard fork, the Shiba Inu team also transitioned the ecosystem’s pioneering decentralized exchange (DEX), ShibaSwap, to Shibarium. ShibaSwap to Shibarium marked a paradigm shift for the ecosystem as the DEX hosts transactions with the capacity to change the overall outlook of the meme coin project.The benefit is already showing up with a corresponding impact on the price. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is changing hands for $0.00002568, up by 6.88% in 24 hours to mimic the general upshoot in the broader market. As a token associated with the Ethereum ecosystem, SHIB might benefit from the prospective launch of a spot ETH ETF product by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The odds of approval of this product at the time were less than 25%; however, Bloomberg ETF analysts raised their odds to a massive 75%, setting the market on a bullish rampage. If approved, the price of ETH might show further bullish strength, with a likely ruboff on Shiba Inu.

Palo Alto Networks Reports Mixed Q3 Results, Shares Decline - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PNAW), a leading cybersecurity company, announced its third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday, revealing slower revenue growth and a cautious fourth-quarter outlook. Following the announcement, the company’s shares experienced a significant decline in after-market trading, reflecting investor disappointment in its performance and guidance.



Palo Alto Reports Mixed Q3



Palo Alto Networks reported a 15% increase in revenue to $1.98 billion for the third quarter, the slowest growth since early 2020. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion fell slightly below analyst expectations. However, the company’s fourth-quarter billings projection of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion was largely in line with expectations.



Despite the mixed results, the company highlighted its strong performance in new subscription sales and next-generation product offerings. The company’s next-generation annualized recurring revenue reached $3.79 billion, exceeding the $3.71 billion estimate and growing by 47%. The remaining performance obligations also increased by 23% to $11.3 billion. The company attributed the growth to its platformization strategy, although this approach has led to increased bookings with deferred payments due to higher client borrowing costs.





Stock Price Performance



As of the most recent market data, Palo Alto Networks’ stock was trading at $307.34, down 5.07%. The stock experienced a significant decline of up to 10% in after-market trading following the announcement of the earnings forecast. Before this decline, the stock had gained about 11% in the month leading up to the earnings announcement.



Despite the current volatility, the company’s stock has shown strong long-term performance, with a 1-year return of +62.91% compared to the S&P 500‘s +26.64%. Analysts remain optimistic about the company’s long-term growth potential, especially with its focus on AI and new subscription models. Analyst price targets for the stock range from a low of $270.00 to a high of $385.00, with a market capitalization of approximately $99.302 billion and a PE Ratio (TTM) of 50.12.



The company’s earnings announcement also had a broader market impact, with shares of peers such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS), and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) declining in extended trading.

In a significant move, 25,000 ETH have been transferred from an unknown wallet to the popular trading platform Robinhood. This substantial move, valued at nearly $92.1 million, has sparked significant speculation and discussion among investors and analysts.The 25,000 ETH move was made in two transactions, indicating a purposeful and deliberate action. The wallet involved in the transfers was previously unknown, making it difficult to determine the funds' origin or owner.Crypto data tracker Whale Alert has reported two transactions involving 12,500 ETH worth around $46 million each, which were moved from the same unknown wallet to Robinhood. The reason behind the move remains unknown, but several speculations persist. An institutional investor or a large fund might be preparing to enter the Ethereum market through Robinhood. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has been on the rise, and such a significant shift could indicate preparation for substantial market activity.The transfer could also be attributed to a crypto whale — an individual or entity holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Whales often move their funds to exchanges when they plan to sell, trade or use them for other investment purposes. The owner of the funds might be preparing for a strategic trading move while anticipating future price movements. Another explanation for the transfer might be to support Robinhood's liquidity needs.Favorable indications of Ethereum ETF approvalThe transfers coincide with favorable indications toward the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the U.S., adding further speculation to the move. According to Bloomberg, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contacted at least one exchange and one potential spot-Ether ETF provider to amend associated 19b-4 filings. According to one of the sources, this could indicate that the chances of SEC approval are improving.In the wake of the news, Ethereum surged over 14% on Monday, the steepest increase since November 2022, before adding to its gains to trade up 20% in the last 24 hours to $3,675 at press time.

Bitcoin To ‘Chop Altcoin Market Up’ in Consolidation Period, Says Analyst Benjamin Cowen - Here’s His Forecast - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto analyst thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely continue to trade close to its record highs at the expense of altcoins.
In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 801,000 subscribers that he believes the only reason Bitcoin is still above $60,000 is because traders are moving money from altcoins into BTC.










Cowen warns that Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto markets will likely witness a larger correction once liquidity in the altcoin markets is exhausted.
“My base case, and I’ve been saying this for months, is that Bitcoin chops the altcoin market up, up here, and then once that liquidity has been bled dry, then Bitcoin is free to have a larger correction. And again, that doesn’t necessarily have to mean all doom and gloom, but who knows? That could still be weeks away. It could be months away. I don’t know how long the degens are going to hold out, they sure as hell have held out longer than I thought they were going to. I tip my hat to them.”

The analyst also says that the next two weeks are going to be “fairly instrumental” whether Bitcoin will see a correction similar to what happened in mid-2019 when BTC collapsed from $14,000 to below $4,000.
Cowen also predicts that the trend of Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum (ETH) will end by July.
Bitcoin is trading at $70,946 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 7% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin is above $70,000, Ether jumps on sepeculation of ETFs approval

Bitcoin and Ether — the two top cryptocurrencies by market cap — thrived on Tuesday on speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve spot Ethereum ETFs this week. Spirit Airlines drops change and cancellation feesThe financial watchdog will decide whether to approve or deny Van Eck’s spot Ethereum ETF application on Thursday and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF application on Friday.Meanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased their approval odds for Ethereum ETFs from 25% to 75%. Balchunas posted on X that the SEC “could be doing a 180” due to increasing political pressure. Crypto has emerged as a political topic in this election year, with presidential candidate Donald Trump making several pro-crypto statements during a campaign in May. Moreover, President Joe Biden is also taking a pro-crypto stance to garner support from the crypto community.On Tuesday morning, Bitcoin was trading at $70,000, with a nearly 6% jump, while Ether was hovering around $3,700, more than a 22% gain, according to CoinMartketCap. Ether’s market capitalization of $440 billion now has surpassed that of payment giant Mastercard, which is valued at $427 billion.Ether ETFs will cause a crypto surge, says an expertThe Ether ETF approval signifies a narrative shift, providing another opportunity for digital assets to enter the market alongside major players, said Jonathan Thomas, CEO and co-founder of Blueberry Protocol, a DeFi (decentralized finance) platform.In an email, he said the approval of Ether ETFs means that regulators see digital assets as something legitimate, while institutions see the benefit of offering crypto services.“As we saw with Bitcoin ETF approvals, the market will become more bullish as well. There’s going to be a surge in buying activity and traders entering a ‘buy the news’ moment, which is likely to push Ethereum to an all-time high,” he said.“The Ether ETF will also be the most profitable ETF for traditional finance as it includes the provisions for staking, and the asset itself will have a native yield.”Why Ether is so important Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network. The network is home to thousands of decentralized applications and financial services, where investors trade, borrow, and lend via automated software protocols rather than traditional banks or financial institutions.Ethereum has some unique features that Bitcoin lacks that bolster its usability. For instance, Bitcoin’s blockchain network cannot be used as a platform for decentralized applications because it was not originally designed for applications to be built directly on its base layer.This is part of the reason why financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity are eager to launch Ether funds, as they see Ether ETFs as a means to expand crypto’s investor base. In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock has consistently mentioned that its digital asset strategy involves launching ETFs and tokenizing financial assets.​​Meanwhile, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein resigned on Monday, just a few weeks after the company withdrew its application for a futures Ethereum ETF. Goldman Sachs’ head of strategy, Peter Mintzberg, will become its new CEO in August.

Memecoin Mania Helps Dogecoin ($DOGE) to Flip Red-Hot Toncoin ($TON) | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 21, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency managed to flip the Telegram-supported Toncoin ($TON) to become the 9th most valuable cryptoasset by market cap.







Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that emerged as a joke in December 2013, created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. They aimed to develop a fun, less serious alternative to Bitcoin, drawing inspiration from the popular “Doge” meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin quickly garnered a significant following due to its lighthearted nature and vibrant community.



Dogecoin operates on a technology similar to Bitcoin but with notable differences. It utilizes the Scrypt algorithm for its proof-of-work system, contrasting with Bitcoin’s SHA-256 algorithm. One distinctive feature of Dogecoin is its supply model. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins, Dogecoin has no maximum limit. Currently, there are roughly 144 billion DOGE coins in circulation, with more being produced annually.



At the time of writing (2:22 p.m. UTC on May 21), DOGE is trading at around $0.1704, up 13% in the past 24-hour period. 



Kaleo, popularly known in the cryptocurrency community as Crypto Kaleo, is a well-known trader and analyst with a significant social media presence, especially on Twitter. He is respected for his market analysis, trading strategies, and insights on various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and altcoins.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On 17 May 2024, Kaleo shared his expectation of an imminent rise in Dogecoin (DOGE) on the social media platform X, indicating that the cryptocurrency is set for a notable upward movement. He later clarified to a follower that while his short-term forecasts for Dogecoin typically suggest a move higher, there could be a brief dip before the anticipated rise. Kaleo stressed the importance of consistently accumulating Dogecoin despite short-term volatility.



That same day, Kaleo expanded on his optimistic view of Dogecoin, comparing the recent surge in meme stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) to the behavior of retail investors. He noted that the revival of meme stocks indicates that retail traders are again willing to take risks. This risk-on attitude has been prevalent in the cryptocurrency market over the past year, especially with the rise of various memecoins such as Pepe and Dogwifhat.



Kaleo emphasized Dogecoin’s continued prominence as the leading memecoin, citing its strong recognition among retail investors and the cryptocurrency community. He pointed out that Dogecoin was the original meme that inspired confidence in the potential of a community-driven cryptocurrency movement. Despite market ups and downs, he maintained that Dogecoin is far from being outdated.



Kaleo argued that once Dogecoin starts to attract more buying interest, it is likely to experience a rapid upward movement. He observed that the cryptocurrency community is currently flooded with numerous options, while retail investors are eager for the excitement they recently felt with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Kaleo believes it is only a matter of time before Dogecoin gains momentum again and emphasized his determination not to miss the opportunity when it arises.

Trump Fuks SEC (TRUMPSEC) to Skyrocket 14,000% as Bitrue Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Trump Fuks SEC (TRUMPSEC) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Trump Fuks SEC (TRUMPSEC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because TRUMPSEC has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on Bitrue.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Trump Fuks SEC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks SEC could become the next viral memecoin.



Trump Fuks SEC launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Trump Fuks SEC on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the Bitrue listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks SEC by entering its contract address – AAraTzqWht3m6i6A82huRES3kyCp5vHYzh13gzHA5sGJ – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSEC.

Ethereum bloodbath: $100M in ETH liquidated in 24 hours


    Ethereum (ETH) experienced a dramatic 17% surge within 24 hours, reaching $3,645 and causing a frenzy in the cryptocurrency market. 



This surge led to significant liquidations, with Ethereum leading the pack. Liquidations totaled $114.47 million, including $29.98 million in longs and a substantial $84.50 million in shorts, highlighting the asset’s volatility and market dominance.



On May 21, ETH soared to an intraday peak of $3,691 per coin. According to the data from Santiment , ETH’s trading volume has totaled $37 billion, representing its highest since March 5.

Ethereum’s recent rally to a two-month high was largely influenced by Bloomberg analysts increasing the odds of the Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund’s (ETF) successful launch. 



In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on May 20, Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg, raised the approval odds for ETFs from 25% to 75%.







This followed reports that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested aspiring ETH ETF applicants to update their 19b-4 filings.



The overall crypto market experienced total liquidations of $340.35 million, with $77.26 million in longs and $263.34 million in shorts, according to Coinglass. 



Over the past day, 78,944 traders faced liquidation, with the largest individual liquidation occurring on Huobi, involving an ETH-USDT pair worth $3.11 million.



Increased Trading Activity 



The aggregated open interest for ether futures on centralized exchanges has reached a record $14 billion, indicating increased trading activity around Ethereum.

This rise in open interest coincides with ETH’s price surge to $3,812, an 22% increase in the last 24 hours. The spike in open interest is closely related to the recent liquidations, as more traders have opened future positions, particularly on the bullish side. 



The rapid price movement triggered liquidations of short positions, further fueling the upward price momentum and underscoring the high stakes and volatility in Ethereum trading.



Increased Social Activity and Analyst Predictions



On-chain data revealed a significant spike in whale activity, with 1,393 transactions worth over $1 million completed on May 20, the highest number since April 14. 



Transactions worth above $100,000 totaled 11,827, a peak not seen since April 15. ETH’s recent surge has also led to an increase in its social activity, with its social dominance at 17.21%, its highest since February.

Adding to the optimism, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick expects the ETH SPOT ETF to be approved this week, potentially leading to inflows of $15 billion to $45 billion in the first 12 months, which could push ETH to $8,000 by the end of 2024.



Market participants view the approval of an ether ETF as a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. 



The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.



What’s next for ETH

At press time, Ethreum is  traded at $3802, recording a 21% price hike in the past 24 hours.



The surge in trading activity has led to increased liquidations, significant whale movements, and heightened social discussions, all contributing to the overall market excitement and speculation about future regulatory approvals and market trends.

Bitcoin Halving Strains Miners as Revenues Drop - The Defiant

A decline in the network hash rate signals falling miner revenues.Bitcoin's recent halving event is delivering a financial blow to mining operators, as their earnings have sharply declined.Data from Bitinfocharts show that the average transaction fee on April 19, the day of the halving, surged to $127, but has since plummeted over 99% to $1.69.Bitcoin fees, and therefore miner revenue, has declined as activity around the network's new non-fungible-like tokens has waned after their initial hype, according to Kaiko Research.Declining Bitcoin miners’ revenue means operations need to focus on cost-cutting, seek more efficient energy sources and, in some cases, even shut down, potentially reducing network decentralization."Everyone is feeling the squeeze post-halving," said Manthan Dave, Co-Founder of Ripple-backed digital asset custody platform, Palisade. "We will see smaller, less efficient mining setups struggle or collapse. Consolidation will continue, sparking fears about centralization."Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, cutting the reward miners receive for completing a block by half. This process reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated, thereby limiting supply. The most recent halving occurred last month, and the next one is expected in 2028.Kaiko Research mentioned that miners often consider Bitcoin holdings as liquid assets, selling them to cover operating costs. For instance, Marathon Digital Holdings holds 17,631 BTC worth over $1.1 billion, while Riot Platforms holds 8,872 BTC valued at over $500 million.“If miners were forced to sell even a fraction of their holdings over the coming month this would have a negative impact on markets,” the research said.Declining RevenuesSigns of declining miner revenues can be observed through a decrease in the network hash rate, according to CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartun.Data from blockchain.com shows that on the day of the halving, the Bitcoin hash rate peaked at 650 exahashes per second (EH/s), while it currently stands at 591 EH/s. Although this decline is still modest and brief, it stands out because "the hashrate typically rises [post-halving],” said Maartun.The hash rate measures the computational power used by miners to solve cryptographic puzzles and validate transactions. It is expressed in exahashes per second (EH/s), indicating the number of calculations performed per second across the network.Maartun explains that periods of rapid declines in the hashrate often indicate miner capitulation. "In practice, ‘miner capitulation’ means less efficient miners are withdrawing."He added, "[Miners] They are turning off their machines, resulting in less computational power available for mining. Additionally; they might [be] relocating to other areas or selling recently mined bitcoin to cover operational costs.”Operational ChangesAndy Fajar Handika, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin mining pool Loka Mining, told The Defiant that the decline in Bitcoin mining revenues has prompted miners to make operational changes, including upgrading to newer ASICS machines. "Investing in newer machines is a priority to reduce operational costs and cope with the reduced revenues resulting from the post halving side effects."One of the biggest factors in maintaining profitability post-halving is securing cheaper electricity, Handika emphasized. "Many miners have considered or already relocated to regions with cheaper electricity. Ethiopia has now become one of the hottest miners spots with low energy cost."Bitcoin nodes, which are computers running the Bitcoin software to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain network, have decreased.The number of BTC nodes on the day of halving was 18.59K, while it currently stands at 17.3K nodes, representing a 6.92% drop, data from Coin.dance shows.This reduction means fewer participants are actively validating transactions, leading to potential centralization concerns as it diminishes the number of independent entities ensuring the Bitcoin network's integrity.BTC Production DropsIn April, major Bitcoin companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Core Scientific (CORZ), and CleanSpark (CLSK), among others, collectively produced 5,139 BTC, data from The Miner Mag shows.This represents a 9.41% decline from March, which saw 5,673 BTC produced, and a more significant drop of 34.71% from December's production of 7,873 BTC — the highest recorded in both 2023 and 2024.Marathon Digital Holdings led the pack in April with an output of 850 BTC. Core Scientific followed closely, producing 813 BTC, while CleanSpark contributed 721 BTC.Future OutlookDave pointed out that miners exiting due to high costs might shift to other crypto activities."They are likely to reuse their hardware and switch to mining on other chains or redeploy capital into other operations such as staking," he suggested.Looking ahead, Ryan Song, head of CoinWestern Ventures, a Bitcoin mining consultancy firm, told The Defiant that miners are likely to diversify their ventures into fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and machine learning. He explained that miners can repurpose their powerful computers for more profitable activities."By using their advanced hardware, miners can train AI models," he said. "This requires a lot of processing power to recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes efficiently."In the gaming industry, miners' expertise can be applied to rendering high-quality graphics, a process that needs computational resources.Song also mentioned that miners could support complex machine learning algorithms. "These algorithms need a lot of computing power for data analysis and learning processes," he noted. "By shifting to these activities, miners can secure new revenue streams while ensuring the long-term sustainability of their operations."As for Bitcoin, while investors cheered because the supply was reduced, it turns out that miners force-selling BTC to cover costs means the halving outcome isn’t so straightforward.

Over $2.69 million short positions and $2.1 million worth of longs have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, although Gala has received a bullish forecast from market maker DWF Labs, which announced the purchase of 25 million GALA tokens.
SEC’s potential approval of spot Ether ETF boosts bulls
The huge liquidations come as fresh sentiment around spot Ethereum ETFs approval lifted the crypto market. 
This followed SEC’s request for Ether ETF issuers to file their 19b-4s by 10 am on May 21, a development that has seen Bloomberg ETF analysts increase their odds for a SEC approval from 25% to 75%.
Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoff Kendrick said in a note on Tuesday that there’s a possibility of the SEC greenlighting the first spot Ethereum ETF for the US market this week.
Standard Chartered also predicts that ETH price could spike to $8,000 by the end of the year. 
In March, analysts at the bank projected Bitcoin could surge to $15ok in 2024 and $250k by end of 2025 on the back of ETF traction.

This Crypto Startup Says You Can Earn Rewards By Training Its AI - Decrypt

New AI startup FLock wants to entice users to help train its large language model with a crypto rewards program, the company told Decrypt on Tuesday. Through a token airdrop—a familiar practice in crypto projects and games—FLock also wants to lure developers to build on its AI platform.“We want to create FLock as a marketplace or platform for communities,” company founder and CEO Jiahao Sun said. “Instead of us creating models for them, we provide the infrastructure so everyone can compete with their model.“Whoever wins will get the best incentive from business use cases or stakeholders paying for the use case,” Sun added.Typically, AI models require massive amounts of data to function, and the original creators of that data are rarely compensated—a sticking point that has led to massive lawsuits and labor union strikes. Decentralized AI aims to address concerns about privacy, data storage, and access, Sun said.“What I'm thinking about decentralized AI is, we are contributing to the last mile of data, privacy, and user control,” Sun said. “That's where I think FLock steps in so people can leverage those last mile data to fine-tune even better models.“It doesn't necessarily mean that our model is way bigger compared to [OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft], but it will definitely mean that the amount of quality data is bigger because we are getting it directly from users,” he said.Based in London and launched in 2022, FLock aims to advance AI with the decentralization provide by blockchain technology. Still in its testnet phase, FLock said it will eventually distribute rewards to users who stake its FML tokens on the Ethereum layer-two network BASE. Users can also engage with the FLock.io network as training nodes, validators, or delegators. “The staking program is not a traditional financial staking mechanism—it is FLock’s own mechanism to govern training authentication,” Sun said. “Good players keep getting FMLs to participate in more and new tasks, while bad players who cheat or fake training results will be slashed out of FML tokens and, hence, exit the training [or] participation [in the] FLock system.”Sun said while FLock’s AI platform is designed to be open to anyone, people in certain regions, including the United States, are prohibited from participating in the FML staking rewards program due to government regulations.Joining FLock in the beta rollout is blockchain infrastructure company Foundry, which is also active in the Bitcoin mining space. “The cloud collaboration with Foundry leverages their deep infrastructure to validate and support the models,” Sun explained.With AI becoming more ubiquitous, alternatives to centralized corporate AI are gaining support. Early this month, ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees debuted his latest project, a decentralized AI model called Venice AI.“Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said, noting that some government regulations require companies to retain customer information. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.”“The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added. “That's what we tried to build.”In March, three leading decentralized AI projects–Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol—announced their intention to merge and create the world's largest decentralized AI ecosystem called Superintelligence Alliance.In addition to merging their efforts and respective communities earlier this month, the Superintelligence Alliance also announced the merging of their native tokens–FET, AGIX, and OCEAN–into the new ASI token.“The objective is to make ASI the network of AI true decentralization of technological development and deployment,” Fetch.AI CEO and Chairman of the Alliance, Humayun Sheikh, told Decrypt.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Just when everyone thought that spot Ether ETFs were going to be denied on Thursday, news broke Monday that they are now likely to be approved, with Bloomberg analysts tripling their odds to a 75% chance of approval.
Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, and Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, say this reversal definitely has to do with politics, citing the fight of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a rule that was unfriendly to financial institutions wanting to engage with crypto.
Plus, they delve into the reasons why Michael Sonnenshein stepped down as CEO of Grayscale after 10 years (hint: it has to do with GBTC), what the 13F filings revealed about who’s been buying the spot bitcoin ETFs since the beginning of the year, and what Vanguard’s incoming CEO, Salim Ramji, who was instrumental to getting BlackRock to launch its Bitcoin ETF, could mean for crypto’s future at the asset management firm.
Show highlights:

Why Eric believes the ether ETFs will be approved
Why Matt thinks the Bitcoin ETFs set off a “complete sea change in Washington around crypto”
Whether the spot Ether ETFs will be approved with or without staking
Who the authorized participants and other behind-the-scenes players in the ether ETFs will be
When the ETH ETFs could start trading and why Eric believes they won’t be as successful as Bitcoin ETFs

Ether Soars to Two-Month High Amid ETF Approval Rumors - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a significant price surge, reaching a two-month high of $3,824, following rumors that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may soon approve spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).The news sparked a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum’s price increasing by over 22% within a few hours and the overall digital asset market gaining 7.5%, reaching a market cap of $2.6 trillion with a 130% increase in trading volumes.



Ether Hits 2-Week High Amid Spot ETF Speculation



The cryptocurrency market showed significant gains, with Ethereum’s price surging by 21.93% to $3,796.83, Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $70,338.38, and other altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) also rising. Reports suggesting the SEC might approve Ether ETFs soon contributed to the price surge, with Ether’s price rising by 24.50% to around $3,790, the highest level in two months. 





Why is the Ether Price Soaring?



The primary reason behind Ethereum’s significant price increase is the growing speculation about the SEC nearing approval for spot Ether ETFs. 



Two main factors drove Ether’s recent price surge: increasing chances of U.S. approval for a spot Ethereum ETF and a DOJ indictment reducing the likelihood of ETH being classified as a security. The SEC’s reported engagement with cryptocurrency exchanges and ETF issuers to update their filings has significantly raised investor confidence. At the same time, a sharp increase in Ether Futures open interest and funding rates indicated growing investor interest and bullish sentiment towards Ethereum.







Do you think we could see a Bitcoin-like rally with Ethereum if spot ETFs are approved? Let us know in the comments below.

In an exciting development within the cryptocurrency market, Bonk (BONK), the dog-themed meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, has surged by over 35% in price, pushing its market value to an impressive $2 billion. This meteoric rise highlights the growing appeal of meme coins and their significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market.Bonk, inspired by the success of other dog coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), quickly gained traction after its launch on the Solana blockchain.According to CoinMarketCap data, BONK's market capitalization is now $2.04 billion, placing it as the 55th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.BONK/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewThe broader cryptocurrency market has been experiencing positive sentiment, with major coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showing strength. This overall bullish trend has spilled over to altcoins and meme coins, including BONK.Crypto prices increased on signs of progress toward U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Ethereum, reversing a more negative outlook last week. The market rise is reminiscent of the investor excitement that preceded the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, highlights BONK's spectacular price gain, citing the enthusiasm surrounding Ethereum's first-place ETF as a driver for one of crypto's top five days of 2024.At the time of writing, BONK was up 28% in the past 24 hours to $0.00003217, and up 38% in the last seven days. BONK has been steadily rising since May 13 after reaching a low of $0.0000214. The rise culminated in highs of $0.0000345 in today's trading session. BONK's 24-hour trading volume is up 280% to $1.34 billion. According to Kaiko, meme tokens have shown resilience after trade volumes reached multiyear highs of $71 billion in mid-March. Trade volume for meme coins remains robust, with weekly volume increasing by more than 200% year to date.

                        British multinational banking giant Standard Chartered is standing by its $8000 ETH prediction for 2024 as the odds of a long-awaited Ethereum ETF approval have suddenly turned optimistic.In a recent conversation with The Block, the bank predicted that Ether spot ETFs will go live in the United States this week, with “80% to 90%” confidence.Standard Chartered Bullish On Ethereum ETFs
“After approval, we estimate that spot ETFs will drive inflows of 2.39-9.15 million ether in the first 12 months after approval,” said Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research. “In U.S. dollar terms, that equates to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion.”The analyst made the same prediction for ETH ETF inflows in a research note back in March, basing his figures on his expectations for Bitcoin ETF inflows on a market cap-adjusted basis.Since launching in January, Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. have accumulated $12.8 billion of net inflows. While the funds faced modest outflows in April, they recovered in May as months-long outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to have stabilized.Bitcoin’s price and ETF flows were bolstered by industry-shaking news on Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called on exchanges to update their applications to list Ether spot ETFs on an accelerated basis.The news signaled unprecedented engagement from the agency regarding the applications, suggesting they might approve the products before their response deadline on May 23. Bloomberg ETF analysts initially assigned a 25% likelihood of their approval before upping their odds to 75% on Monday.Bullish Outlook For BTC And ETH
Standard Chartered was one of few banks to voice optimism that such funds would be greenlit despite a lack of SEC interest for several months before this week. As such, their bullish predictions for both ETH and BTC hold firm.“Given that we now see bitcoin reaching the $150,000 level by end-2024, this would imply a level of $8,000 for ether,” Kendrick wrote.Kendrick added that he expects the ETH/BTC price ratio to hold at 0.054 until the end of the year. By the end of 2025, he believes BTC will reach $200,000 per coin, while ETH will reach $14,000.

Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Spikes Up 7%


                        
                            Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Spikes Up 6% as Attention Returns to Meme Coins – Time to Buy?

                        The SHIB price has raised 7.55% in the past 24 hours, increasing to $0.000026. This comes as the crypto market as a whole has experienced a surge.SHIB is now up 9.96% in the past week, indicating a reversal of its monthly 2.56% price decrease.In the past year, the altcoin has seen a substantial return of 192.05%, as per Binance data.This is significant compared to the returns of major tokens like BTC, ETH, and SOL in the past 12 months. Suggesting that SHIB is seeing widespread interest among investors.This recent price action follows the return of 2021 market catalyst Roaring Kitty, the trader known for sparking the GameStop frenzy as well as promising news emerging regarding an Ethereum ETF approval this week.Will SHIB’s Price Surge Continue?
SHIB’s chart is looking promising today, with the coin looking ready to post some more gains after its surge earlier this week.The meme coin has just broken through its downtrend (yellow). This decisive breakthrough indicates a shift in momentum toward an uptrend and a continuation of the price increase.Other indicators support this, with SHIB’s relative strength index (RSI) line (purple) rebounding towards 60, up from a low of 30 earlier this week. This suggests that the recent downtrend was temporary and does not signal a complete shift in momentum.Additionally, the meme coin’s 30-day moving average (orange) is trending upward above the 200-day average (blue) in a continuation from the past week. This suggests that SHIB is currently overbought – indicating confidence among traders.The coin’s 24-hour trading volume has also risen in recent days, with its move up 135.12% to $914.28M. This confirms increased interest in SHIB among investors.Several factors contribute to optimism about SHIB’s price, including the broader market’s upward trend following a slowdown in March.While technical indicators suggest positive short-term price movements, sustainable long-term growth will likely hinge on fundamental factors.Meme Coins Are Getting Attention Again
The iconic retail trader “Roaring Kitty,” who gained fame during the 2021 meme stock surge, recently returned to X for the first time since 2021.This has reignited excitement for a potential new wave of meme stock and meme coin trading, with traders actively seeking the next GME-like opportunity.Given that SHIB has already accumulated a $15B market cap, traders are scrambling to find the next low-cap meme coins primed to explode.The meme coin market is over-saturated with Shiba Inu-themed coins boasting little to no real utility. Something which may credit Weiner AI’s (WAI) recent success, raising over $2 million in its presale so far.The sausage dog-themed coin not only offers a suite of AI-powered trading tools but is a potential passive income gem.69% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards, and investors are currently earning a massive 409% APY, as per the project’s official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months.Follow the latest developments on Weiner AI’s X account.Buy WienerAI Here

Raoul Pal Delivers Epic Prediction for Ethereum All-Time High


The crypto space is buzzing as the deadline for the SEC's decision on the spot Ethereum ETF looms this week, with a decision expected as early as May 23. Adding to the excitement, top industry analysts have increased the probability of approval from 25% to 75%. This optimistic outlook has already had a notable impact on the market, with Ethereum's price surging more than 20% in just one day.Prominent cryptocurrency expert Raoul Pal has weighed in on the potential of this development. He highlighted a scenario where substantial demand for the ETF, coupled with the fact that 30% of Ethereum remains staked and ongoing burning processes make supply deeply negative, could create what he describes as a "banana zone squared."This term refers to a period of exponential growth and market imbalance driven by rapid crypto adoption and significant increases in market capitalization. According to Pal, if these conditions come to fruition, Ethereum could see unprecedented price increases. He suggests that this scenario is already unfolding and predicts that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will experience a massive boom once ETH reaches a new all-time high. ETH to USD by CoinMarketCapThis prediction is particularly noteworthy given Ethereum's previous peak of $4,868, achieved on Nov. 8, 2021. With the altcoin's price currently less than 29% away from this ATH, the stage seems set for significant market activity.Pal's forecast adds a layer of excitement to the already heated discussions surrounding Ethereum and its potential. As enthusiasts eagerly await the SEC's decision, the prospect of a new ATH and subsequent NFT explosion is fueling fear and greed within the crypto community. If Pal's predictions hold true, the coming weeks could mark a historic period for Ethereum and the broader digital asset market.

Diamonds As Digital Currency? How This Innovation Could Revolutionize Payments - Benzinga

The adoption of digital assets is rapidly transforming the financial landscape, with digital commodity currencies like Diamond Standard Carats offering innovative solutions for global payments, especially in regions with limited banking infrastructure.As the industry evolves, the integration of these digital assets is set to impact traditional financial systems significantly.Cormac Kinney, CEO and Founder of Diamond Standard Co., emphasizes the unique position of Diamond Standard Carats, which are classified as commodities rather than virtual currencies. “Any platform using virtual currency is subject to existing money transmitter regulations,” Kinney explains. “Carats are subject to AML above certain amounts and can be transmitted by anyone, including a platform operator, to any other mobile phone via SMS.” This capability allows recipients to sell the commodity for local currency without needing a money exchange license.One of the major hurdles in the digital assets space is the regulatory challenge. However, Kinney points out that commodities have long-established trading laws. “Platforms using Carats are commodity dealers and not money transmitters,” he says, highlighting the regulatory clarity and stability that Carats offer.Transparency and security remain critical for digital assets. Kinney believes that while transparency is important, the necessity to trust an issuer is even more crucial. “USDC may be transparent, but you're still trusting a third-party,” he notes. In contrast, Diamond Standard Carats are backed by physical commodities and are independently verified, reducing the need for trust in third parties. “The title to those commodities is exclusively by the Carat holders. Unlike USDC, the system is bankruptcy-proof,” Kinney adds.In terms of disrupting traditional financial institutions, Kinney sees Carats as offering a significant alternative. “Carats give developers an alternative to money transmitters and, in the case of emerging markets, an alternative to money exchangers like Western Union and MoneyGram,” he explains. Carats can be bought or sold in any retail store, simplifying financial transactions in underbanked regions.The partnership between Diamond Standard Co. and Simplex by Nuvei is a strategic move to enhance the accessibility and usability of Carats. This collaboration will integrate Carats into an extensive payment network, enabling users to buy Carats using credit cards, fiat, or most cryptocurrencies.Simplex’s infrastructure will facilitate seamless value transfers and payments, making it easier for businesses and individuals to use Carats for cross-border remittances and online transactions.Environmental considerations are also part of the conversation. Kinney points out that while digital commodities generally lack economic substance, Diamond Standard Carats involve the actual mining of natural diamonds, contributing to jobs and taxes. This aspect of Carats adds a layer of economic value often missing in other digital currencies.Kinney is optimistic about the future of digital commodity currencies. He predicts that Central Bank digital currencies will likely eliminate many existing cryptocurrencies through regulation. “Carats can be sent to any mobile phone using SMS and then sold in a local store,” he says, emphasizing the practical applications of Carats in everyday transactions.Diamond Standard Partners With Simplex To Streamline PaymentsIn a move that underscores the growing adoption of CARATS, Diamond Standard Co. recently announced a partnership with Simplex by Nuvei. This collaboration will enable users to easily buy and sell CARATS using a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, fiat currency, and other cryptocurrencies.“With this partnership, Carats are now listed on Simplex and available for onramps on leading exchanges and wallets and to the entire 350+ partner network of Simplex,” Kinney said. “Users can effortlessly buy CARATS using credit cards, fiat, or most cryptocurrencies, and use them for easy and quick value transfer.”For those interested in exploring the future of digital assets, the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide valuable insights into the latest trends and developments in the sector. Kinney’s perspective on the integration of digital commodity currencies underscores the transformative potential of these technologies in the global payments industry.Read Next: ‘I Will Be Going Full Tilt Vs The White House:’ Experts Urge Bipartisan Support For Sound Policies Because ‘Pro-Crypto Is Pro-American Values’Image: Shutterstock

BREAKING: Highly Anticipated Airdrop Finally Gives a Clear Date - Big Development This Week - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to the latest development, ZkSync plans to hold a token creation event (TGE) this week and distribute an airdrop in mid-June.
ZkSync, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Matter Labs, is reportedly preparing for its token generation event (TGE) this week, according to some sources within the project. The launch of the token, which includes an airdrop, is expected within 30 days after TGE. The token will have a total supply of 21 billion tokens.


The company is currently targeting June 13 for the airdrop, aiming to act ahead of Blast's token airdrop scheduled for June 26. ZkSync has expressed interest in the ZK ticker for its token. However, since Polyhedra Network already claimed this ticker, some problems arose. Despite this, ZkSync may prefer the ZK ticker, especially considering that Binance does not list Polyhedra's token. “zkSync is currently in the process of becoming decentralized. There are no finalized plans at this time,” a Matter Labs spokesperson said. said.
Last week, ZkSync announced an upcoming upgrade to accelerate the decentralization of its protocol, hinting at a token launch and airdrop by the end of June. “The upcoming release of v24 is the last planned protocol upgrade needed before handing over network management to the community,” ZkSync said in a statement last week.





Matter Labs, the developer behind ZkSync, has received support from well-known investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Dragonfly Capital, Blockchain Capital, Crypto.com Capital, Placeholder Capital and 1kx.

Ethereum's Explosion To $3,800 Puts 90% Investors In Profit


								On-chain data shows 90% of all Ethereum investors are now in profit following the sharp surge that the asset’s price has seen beyond $3,800.
Ethereum Investors Overwhelming In The Green After ETF Rally
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, ETH’s latest rally has meant that a shift in investor profitability has occurred on the network.
To keep track of holder profitability, the analytics firm makes use of on-chain data to find what the average acquisition price or cost basis of each address on the blockchain is.

If this price is less than the current spot value of the cryptocurrency for any address, then that particular investor is considered to be in profit, or “in the money”, as IntoTheBlock defines.
On the other hand, the cost basis being lower than the asset’s price suggests the address is holding some net amount of loss, so its holder would be “out of the money.”
Naturally, if the average buying price of the wallet is equal to the spot price of the coin, then the investor would be considered to be just breaking even (“at the money”).
Now, here is what the profitability breakdown of the Ethereum userbase looks like following the sharp rally that the asset has enjoyed:

Looks like a large amount of investors are in the green at the moment | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As is visible above, 90% of the total addresses on the Ethereum network are holding their coins at some net unrealized gain following the sharp surge the asset’s price has seen.
Interestingly, 0% of the wallets are also out of the money, meaning there is no one on the blockchain that’s in losses anymore. 10% of the investors are still on break-even, though.
Historically, holders in profit have been more likely to sell than those in loss. As such, whenever the market has seen a large imbalance towards green investors, the chances of a selloff happening have been notable.
Because of this reason, tops in the cryptocurrency’s price can become more probable at high profitability ratio levels. Since an overwhelming amount of ETH investors are carrying gains now, a mass profit-taking event may be likely to occur, which can impede the current rally.

It should be noted, though, that during bull markets, the asset has generally been able to sustain high investor profits for a while, as high demand keeps flowing in to absorb any profit-taking, before a top eventually occurs.
That said, the likelihood of at least temporary cooldowns taking place can go up if profitability remains high for too long. It now remains to be seen how the Ethereum price develops from here on out and whether the hype around the spot ETFs will be able to counteract any selloffs in the market.
ETH Price
With a rally of over 22% over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has managed to reach the highest levels in more than two months as its price is now trading around $3,800.

Yuga Labs Partners With Artist Nina Chanel, Unveils Airdrop Plans


							

Yuga Labs entered into a new partnership with Nina Chanel.



The New York-based artist is Yuga Labs’ new artist in residence.



CryptoPunks to exit trading, become historical blockchain art




Yuga Labs, the team behind the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection, has announced a collaboration with the renowned New York-based artist, Nina Chanel.



In a recent post, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano outlined plans to distribute Chanel’s latest collection to supporters of her work within the digital art space.







Solano emphasized that Yuga Labs intends to make Chanel’s work available exclusively to Super Cool World holders through an initial distribution via randomized airdrops. This collaboration, according to Solano, reflects Yuga Labs’ vision of bridging the gap between the traditional art world and the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem.



Solano highlighted the unique qualities of Chanel’s work, specifically her large-scale, graphic pieces featuring bold and vibrant color palettes. He cited her inclusion in the collections of prestigious institutions like MoMA and The Whitney as factors that impressed the Yuga Labs team. Additionally, Solano mentioned the team’s excitement about having Chanel join Yuga Labs as an artist-in-residence.



Solano also provided an update on the CryptoPunks collection, acquired by Yuga Labs earlier this year. The firm, according to Solano, aims to preserve the legacy of CryptoPunks, considering them the “early cave paintings” of the digital art movement. This vision involves collaborating with museums and institutions to acquire digital art pieces and educate their audiences about them.



In essence, Yuga Labs is removing the famous CryptoPunks collection from circulation. However, they will remain decentralized and preserved on the blockchain as historical art pieces that influenced the creation of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) digital art collections.



 
 




For context, CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, NFT characters launched in 2017. This project is considered a pioneering force in the development of digital art solutions within the blockchain ecosystem.

Second Ethereum Foundation Researcher Acknowledges Advisory Deal Paid in EIGEN

"I am taking this position personally, not representing the Ethereum Foundation, and with a focus on risks and decentralization. I am therefore fully expected to take contrarian views on Eigenlayer," Feist wrote in his post. "I do receive a significant amount of tokens from this position. I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this, so that they can keep me accountable."

Cardano Community Fires Back At Claim That ADA Is ‘Extremely Centralized’ ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Founder and chief investment officer of crypto-focused fund Cyber Capital, Justin Bons, recently sparked controversy in the cryptosphere after asserting that Cardano’s native token, ADA, is highly centralized — eliciting strong pushback from enthusiasts.



Cardano Genesis Keys: The Main Point Of Centralization



Justin Bons of Cyber Capital has ignited a debate on the X social media platform regarding the centralization implications of Cardano’s “genesis keys.” 



According to Bons, Cardano is extremely centralized because these genesis keys allow the parent company Input Output Global (IOG) to exercise excessive control over the blockchain. He noted that these keys allow IOG to single-handedly change protocol rules without necessitating a hard fork.



He warned that IOG could possibly halt the blockchain or alter fundamental parameters such as emission schedules, or censor transactions without broad consensus — which he characterized as an unparalleled level of centralized control for a Layer 1 blockchain.



The pundit Bons notes that IOG holds five out of the seven genesis keys, a scenario he thinks sabotages Cardano’s decentralization thesis. He further criticized the decision made during the Shelley update in 2020, where the Cardano Foundation (CF) delegated their control to IOG, granting them absolute control.

&nbsp







While acknowledging Cardano’s efforts towards on-chain governance with the Voltaire upgrade, Justin stated that the Genesis keys still make ADA totally centralized at the moment. In conclusion, he urged users to “verify, not trust,” stressing the importance of examining such centralized mechanisms.







The Cardano community has reacted strongly against Bons’ assertions, as many reacted and expressed their disagreements.







Cardano Yoda, for instance, explained in a lengthy X post that the genesis keys cannot change protocol rules capriciously; rather, they can only trigger a hard fork. He highlighted that any substantial protocol change still requires the participation and agreement of the independent stake pool operators running Cardano nodes.



The Cardano aficionado noted that the genesis keys could be used to change certain protocol parameters, including taking rewards or block size, but always with community approval.



YODA concluded by noting that Cardano’s governance will soon move to the community, rendering Genesis keys basically useless. Roles currently controlled by IOG, CF, and Emurgo will be handed to Delegate Representatives (DReps) after the incoming Chang hard fork. Only DReps, together with the Constitution Committee and SPOs, will be able to decide on governance moves.

$80 Million Cryptocurrency Operation from the US Department of Justice! Which Altcoins Are There? - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to The Block, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) seized the dark web drug market that processed $80 million worth of cryptocurrency.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the dark web drug market called Incognito Market facilitated the sale of substances including fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and other illegal drugs in the United States and around the world.


The platform charged a 5% transaction fee for drug purchases, according to DOJ data. At this point, the platform accepted Bitcoin (BTC) or the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) as transaction fees.
Incognito Market has processed $80 million worth of cryptocurrency transactions during its three-year operation.





In its statement, the DOJ stated that the chief executive of Incognito Market was arrested.
US Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York said in his statement:



“As alleged, Rui-Siang Lin operated a sophisticated and dangerous online narcotics market from which he profited millions of dollars at the expense of the community.

Crypto Pundit Says Shiba Inu Bullish Pennant Will Push Price To New Highs, Here's The Target | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto analyst has predicted a massive bull rally for doggy-themed cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu (SHIB). The analyst points to a new technical pattern emerging for SHIB, indicating the potential for a surge to new highs. 
SHIB Sets Sights For Next Upside Target
A crypto and Bitcoin analyst identified as ‘Clifton Fx’ on X (formerly Twitter) shared a Shiba Inu/Tether (USDT) price chart depicting the next price target for the popular doggy-themed meme coin. The analyst unveiled a new technical trading pattern exhibited in SHIB’s price movements, emphasizing the meme coin’s price chart was displaying a bullish pennant formation in the daily time frame. 

Source: X
A bullish pennant formation is a technical pattern that occurs after an uptrend and indicates the potential continuation of the strong upward momentum. For more clarity, it signals when the bulls are about to take charge of a cryptocurrency’s value, highlighted by a period of accumulation by investors before a bullish breakout occurs. 
In the case of Shiba Inu, Clifton believes that the current formation of a bullish pennant suggests a potential upside breakout of about 50% to 60%, supported by the increasing trading volume and market sentiment surrounding the meme coin. In his price chart illustrating Shiba Inu’s price actions from January to May 2024, the crypto analyst pinpointed a green area, proposing that Shiba Inu could witness a significant rise to $0.00004 before June 2024.  
Another crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has predicted a less ambitious price target for Shiba Inu. Martinez disclosed in a previous X post that Shiba Inu could witness a 20% upswing to $0.00002954 in the coming weeks. He based his projections on the likelihood of the doggy-themed meme coin successfully breaking the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444. 
Shiba Inu Price Fundamentals Grow Stronger
Clifton’s optimistic projection for Shiba Inu comes at a time when the meme coin has been outperforming, witnessing new gains and bolstering its overall market strength. At the time of writing, the price of SHIB is trading at $0.000025, marking a 6.18% increase in the last 24 hours.  

The cryptocurrency was previously consolidating around the $0.000024 price mark for weeks, recording consistent declines due to market volatility and broader sentiment surrounding meme coins. Currently, excluding Shiba Inu, other meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are recording massive daily gains. This unexpected price surge underscores investors’ renewed interest and demand for meme coins in the market.  
Additionally, over the past seven days, the price of Shiba Inu surged by more than 6%. The meme coin’s trading volume of approximately $914.2 million has also witnessed an impressive rally, skyrocketing by 134.85% in just 24 hours.

Ethereum beats Mastercard: Explaining ETH's 20% price surge - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price soared by 20%, overtaking Mastercard in market cap, amid strong buying pressure.
SEC’s shift towards likely approval of an ETH ETF has sparked a market rally.

So far, Ethereum [ETH] has experienced a remarkable surge, ascending by nearly 20% in just the past day. This impressive increase pushed Ethereum’s price to exceed $3,600, marking the highest level since 19th April. 
The asset’s volume is also on an uptrend, indicating strong buying pressure in the market. This development comes amid a sign of Ethereum’s growing influence and adoption, underscoring its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Leon Waidmaqnn, a noted on-chain analyst, has pointed out that Ethereum’s market capitalization has now surpassed that of the global payments giant Mastercard, standing at $440 billion compared to Mastercard’s $427 billion. 
This shift is not just a reflection of Ethereum’s growing prominence but also a sign of the broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.
Regulatory changes and market dynamics
The recent upswing in Ethereum’s market value follows a significant development in the regulatory landscape. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown signs of a positive shift regarding the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. 
Bloomberg analysts have notably revised their approval probabilities for an Ethereum ETF from 25% to 75%. This change is based on indications that the SEC is rapidly altering its stance, with exchanges being prompted to update their 19b-4 filings in preparation for a potential approval as early as 22nd May.
The regulatory pivot appears to be a key driver behind the current bullish momentum in Ethereum’s market. 
Meanwhile, the increase in Ethereum’s circulating supply from 119.6 million ETH in mid-April to 119.73 million ETH at press time, according to data from Glassnode, suggests more tokens are available for trading and transactions. 
Although this could typically indicate increased selling pressure, the current market dynamics show that demand remains robust, likely fueled by the current anticipation of the ETH spot ETF approval.
Source: Glassnode
Market response and future outlook
Amid these developments, Ethereum has not only surged in price but also shown significant movements in other market metrics. 
For example, the total value staked in Ethereum has also risen from 43 million ETH last month to over 44 million ETH, according to Glassnode. 
This increase in staked ETH underscores the growing confidence of investors in Ethereum’s long-term value and utility.
Source: Glassnode
However, not all market participants are benefiting from this rise. Coinglass data revealed over $10 million in liquidations in the Ethereum market over the past 24 hours, with short sellers bearing the brunt of these losses. 
This follows a larger trend of short position liquidations worth over $80 million the previous day, indicating that many who bet against Ethereum were caught off-guard by its rapid ascent.

Looking at Ethereum’s price chart, the asset appears poised for further gains.

SEC signals potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs to exchanges, Barrons reports - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            SEC staff informed exchanges on Monday that they are now inclined to approve these products, pending resolution of certain comments on the applications, according to a report by Barrons.The SEC faces a final deadline on Thursday to approve or reject a filing by VanEck for an ETF holding spot Ether. Similar deadlines for other firms, including ARK Invest, 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, Fidelity, BlackRock, and Franklin Resources, will follow in the coming months.One person familiar with the matter indicated that the SEC provided feedback on applications to most issuers, suggesting a coordinated launch of several Ether ETFs. This approach mirrors the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which helped propel Bitcoin to a 60% gain this year.Just days ago, it seemed likely that the SEC would reject efforts by BlackRock, VanEck, and others to launch exchange-traded funds holding Ether.The SEC has not yet approved any ETFs holding the currency itself, although ETFs holding Ether futures are permitted.Reports of the SEC’s potential approval have already impacted the market, with Ether prices rising 23% to $3,790 and Bitcoin up 5% to $70,350 on Tuesday.ETF approvals could open the Ether market to institutional investors and increase interest in smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche.If approved, the ETFs could benefit investors in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which trades at a discount to the value of its Ether holdings. Grayscale is seeking to convert the trust into an ETF, which would close the discount and provide immediate returns to investors.Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently increased their odds of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved in the US from 25% to 75%. Following this news, Ethereum (ETH) prices surged by 8.3%, reflecting growing market optimism about the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC.

Professor From Ripple Research Initiative Urges Crypto Firms Transition to Quantum-Resistant Tech Immediately - The Daily Hodl


								A mathematics professor and cryptography expert thinks crypto firms need to prioritize setting up defenses against the threat of future quantum attacks.
In a new interview with Ripple, Dr. Massimiliano Sala, a professor at the University of Trento in Italy, warns that future quantum computers could “easily solve problems that are foundational to digital signatures,” undermining crypto asset security.










Sala, the head of the Italian Cryptographic Association, thinks all classical public-key cryptosystems should be replaced with upgraded versions that can maintain security against quantum attacks. He suggests that projects begin to transition immediately.
“The probability of quantum threats materializing may not be imminent, but it is significant enough to warrant proactive measures.”
Sala acknowledges that quantum-resistant systems come with tradeoffs, including increased computational demands and larger data sizes for secure transactions. The cryptography expert suggests that blockchain systems first incorporate quantum-safe elements in less critical areas to avoid undermining the functionality of their networks.
Sala isn’t the first expert to warn about the perils of quantum computing. In 2021, a team of researchers at the University of Sussex examined what level of quantum computing power could threaten the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.
Explained team leader Mark Webber,
“State-of-the-art quantum computers today only have 50-100 qubits. Our estimated requirement of 30 [million] to 300 million physical qubits suggests Bitcoin should be considered safe from a quantum attack for now, but devices of this size are generally considered achievable, and future advancements may bring the requirements down further.”
A qubit is a quantum bit, the basic unit when calculating in a quantum system that’s comparable to the ones and zeroes of traditional binary computing.

Ethereum Soars on Spot ETF Rumors: A Regulatory Turning Point? ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continued to surge Tuesday after skyrocketing over 20% on Monday. This surge comes amidst growing speculation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may finally approve the first spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).



The hype surrounding a potential spot ETF approval has been a major catalyst for the recent price increase. Notably, their introduction would significantly develop the cryptocurrency industry, potentially attracting new investors and boosting mainstream adoption of Ethereum.



The optimism around spot ETFs stems from recent reports indicating that the SEC requests amendments to applications from asset managers seeking to launch these products. While this request could signify a delay, it is generally viewed positively as it suggests the SEC actively engages with the proposals rather than outright rejecting them.



Analysts like Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg have even revised their approval estimates upwards, putting the chances of a spot Ethereum ETF launch much higher than in the previous estimate.



“James Seyffart and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied).” Balchunas tweeted on Monday.

&nbsp



This shift reflects a growing belief that the SEC may be softening its stance on cryptocurrency regulations, potentially due to increasing political pressure, despite the path to a spot ETF launch remaining complex.



Notably, however, the SEC still needs to approve both the rule changes proposed by exchanges (Form 19b-4 filings) and the registration statements of the ETFs themselves (S-1 filings). Even if the 19b-4 filings are approved quickly, the SEC could still delay the S-1s for further scrutiny.



Elsewhere, investors have been dabbling in ETH investments. One interesting development is the recent activity of prominent crypto investor James Fickel. As highlighted by Lookonchain on Tuesday, Fickel has been accumulating Ethereum in anticipation of a potential ETF launch. On Tuesday, the firm reported that he had borrowed over $150 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and exchanged it for Ethereum, suggesting a solid belief in the positive impact of an ETF approval.



The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. If the SEC approves the 19b-4 filings and the path toward a spot ETF launch becomes clearer, investors can expect continued bullish momentum for Ethereum. However, any delays or rejections from the SEC could lead to a significant price pullback.



ETH was trading at $3,778 at press time, reflecting a 21.88% surge over the past 24 hours. As seen on CoinMarketCap, its purchase volume had increased 336% over the same period.

EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive 'Mass Adoption' - What Investors Need To Know Now About Looming SEC Decision - Benzinga

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent request for revisions to Ether ETF applications has sparked a wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry. Benzinga talked to experts, who believe a potential green light for these ETFs could attract new investments and accelerate the mainstream adoption of Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies.What Are Ethereum ETFs?Ethereum ETFs would function similarly to any other ETF you might find on the stock market.It would be a basket of investments that tracks the price of ether ETH/USD, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.Investors could buy shares in the ETFs just like they would buy shares of a company, gaining exposure to Ethereum’s price movement without needing to directly own or manage the cryptocurrency itself.Why Are Ethereum ETFs Important?The approval of Ethereum ETFs would be a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Here’s why it’s generating so much buzz:
Increased Accessibility: ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for mainstream investors who might be hesitant to dive into the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges. This could lead to a significant influx of new capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially driving up its price.



Enhanced Legitimacy: A green light from the SEC would be a major vote of confidence for Ethereum, signifying its acceptance as a legitimate asset class. This could attract institutional investors who have so far remained on the sidelines due to regulatory uncertainty.



Potential Price Impact: Analysts at Standard Chartered predict a surge in ether prices to $8,000 by the end of 2024 if an ETF is approved. The influx of new capital, combined with the increased legitimacy, could fuel a significant price rally.
John Patrick Mullin, Founder and CEO of MANTRA, emphasized the relevance of ETH ETFs, noting that they represent a substantial opportunity for institutional investment. “Given the innovative nature of Ethereum’s tech, including smart contracts and a wide range of dApps, ETH ETFs might attract significant interest from investors who are keen on more diverse crypto exposures,” Mullin stated.The approval of ETH ETFs could potentially lead to massive inflows of capital.Mullin believes that ETH ETFs could see similar or even greater inflows compared to Bitcoin ETFs due to Ethereum’s versatile technology. On the other hand, Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, estimated that Ether-based ETFs might see volumes roughly 30% lower than spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting Bitcoin’s pioneering status.Could It Lead To Other Altcoin ETFs?Approved ETH ETFs could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency traders have even suggested a Dogecoin DOGE/USD ETF is not out of the question. Mullin suggests that once regulatory bodies are comfortable with Ethereum, it could lead to broader acceptance and recognition of other cryptocurrencies. “This could diversify the market further and provide more investment opportunities,” he said.Stoychev echoed this sentiment, stating that the success of an ETH ETF could streamline the approval process for future altcoin ETFs, provided they meet the SEC’s requirements.What Does This Mean For The Price Of Ethereum?The approval of ETH ETFs is expected to have a significant impact on Ethereum’s market dynamics.Mullin believes that approval would initiate a virtuous cycle of stable liquidity and trust-building, potentially leading to more ETFs and increased adoption. “Mass Adoption. It's happening due to ETF approvals,” he affirmed.In contrast, a denial could lead to a temporary drop in ETH’s price due to negative sentiment, although the long-term impact might be less severe if the broader crypto market remains positive. Stoychev noted that if approved, ETH could experience a price increase similar to Bitcoin’s 50% rise post-ETF approval. “ETH could potentially rise to above $4,000,” he suggested, while also warning of a temporary lull and a potential drop back to $3,000 if the ETF is not approved.Also Read: Top House Democrats Will Not Rally Party Against Crypto Bill Despite OppositionWhat Do Experts Think About Ethereum ETFs?Roy Hui, Co-Founder and CEO of LightLink, highlighted Ethereum’s expansive ecosystem and its role as a pivotal infrastructure for the global digital landscape. “The ETH ETF stands out amid other crypto ETFs due to Ethereum’s expansive ecosystem, robust economy and leading market capitalization,” Hui said.Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, pointed out that the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs could lead to increased investment, funds, and liquidity from the U.S. stock market, supporting ETH’s price.“This may mimic the impact of Bitcoin, where external liquidity significantly increases its price, leading to a new historical high in a relatively short period of time,” Kan explained.What Happens Next?The approval process for Ethereum ETFs faces several challenges, especially from the SEC. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has shown a preference for cryptocurrencies that adhere to Bitcoin BTC/USD like standards, posing special challenges for Ethereum due to its security and securitization risks.Kan also noted that the approval of an Ethereum ETF could set new standards for other cryptocurrencies and provide them with examples of applying for their own ETFs. Conversely, a rejection could imply that only cryptocurrencies following Bitcoin-like standards would be considered for ETFs, excluding those based on proof of stake (PoS).The potential approval of ETH ETFs represents a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency market, with significant implications for Ethereum and other digital assets.As the industry waits with bated breath, the decision could either propel Ethereum into a new era of institutional adoption or prompt a temporary market correction.The future of digital assets and regulatory trends will be further explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Industry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape, offering valuable insights into the impact of regulatory decisions like the potential approval of Fidelity’s spot Ether ETF.Read Next: Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Turns Bullish: 10x Research Highlights Key Trade StrategyImage: Shutterstock

Ethereum researcher alleges Wikipedia of biased Solana coverage - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum researcher Emmanuel Awosika posted allegations on X that Wikipedia has an anti-crypto stance, with its coverage of Solana, in particular, being unfair. The allegations made by Awosika also put into questions regarding the involvement of Molly White in editing crypto-related articles on the platform.
“[…] people have complained about Wikipedia’s coverage of the crypto industry, but I never grasped the problem until someone made a “Wikipedia Is Going Great” joke referring to Molly’s potential involvement in editing crypto-related articles,” Awosika said on X.
Awosika is referring to Molly White’s project, Web3 is going just great, which tracks ostensibly questionable events in the crypto industry which “aren’t actually going as well as its proponents might like you to believe.”The Ethereum researcher later branded Wikipedia’s editing style as “absolute garbage” and went on to say that such a framework for coverage wouldn’t be reliable. The images shared in Awosika’s post show the historical coverage of Solana, where Wikipedia cites articles from Reuters, The Verge, and Fortune Crypto. The most recent edit on the Solana page is dated March 17, 2024. 
“No way I’d be touching that project if Wikipedia was my first source of information,” Awosika argued.
Molly White responded by claiming that while her involvement with Wikipedia is public knowledge, decisions in the organization are independently made and are done “in the open.”Awosika argued that Wikipedia has a “clear anti-crypto stance,” highlighting its refusal to accept crypto donations and an alleged history of failing to report on crypto-related subjects. White countered this claim by noting that the Wikimedia Foundation does not accept donations of livestock either, but still manages to “write articles on cows.”Awosika shared images of Wikipedia’s Solana page that detail lawsuits, outages, and hacks related to the platform, as well as its suffering due to the collapse of FTX. He questioned whether there was more to a protocol like Solana than just negative events.White is a known critic of the crypto industry and writes perspectives on disinformation and free and open access values. White recently published an essay on Bloomberg claiming that crypto’s underlying technology “doesn’t have much to offer the average person in their day-to-day life.”
“[…] feel free to go look at how i’ve been involved, rather than just speculating on what you assume i’ve done. i don’t think it’s true that wikipedia has a “clear anti-crypto stance,” White said.
Awosika insinuates that White’s involvement with Wikipedia influenced the platform to reject crypto donations in May 2022, claiming that these were “extremely risky” and “inherently predatory.”White pointed out that her involvement in editing the Solana Wikipedia page was limited to a single grammatical edit, correcting the miscapitalization of “non-fungible-token.” This represents 0.2% of the total edits made to the page.White explained that most information about crypto projects, even large ones like Solana, is limited to industry publications, which generally do not pass the bar for reliable sourcing on Wikipedia. She emphasized that Wikipedia articles are based on what reliable, secondary sources have to say about a topic, not what a topic has to say about itself.

BREAKING: SEC Says to Exchanges That It's Leaning Toward Approving Ethereum Spot ETFs - Bitcoin Sistemi


SEC officials said today they are leaning toward approving exchanges on which Ethereum Spot ETF products will be listed, Barrons reported and people familiar with the matter said.
The agency made comments on the applications that, if resolved in a timely manner, could result in approvals as soon as this week.


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that it is leaning toward approving spot Ethereum ETFs, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by Barrons. SEC officials informed the stock exchanges where the products will be listed about these trends yesterday.
The agency has provided feedback on the applications and could seek approvals as early as this week if any issues raised are resolved in a timely manner.





Notably, the SEC provides feedback to most issuers, even those with response deadlines later in the year. This may indicate that the SEC intends to coordinate the launch of several ETH ETFs at the same time.
Approval of ETFs could open the ETH market to institutional investors, such as foundations and pension funds, who are currently unable or unwilling to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. It could also lead to increased interest in smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche as investors consider other tokens increasingly likely to eventually receive approval for inclusion in funds.


However, even if the SEC approves the initial 19b-4 filings this week, it does not mean that ETH ETFs will launch at the same time. The agency has yet to provide feedback to some issuers on their S-1 filings, another critical part of the launch of ETFs.

Ethereum Flips Mastercard in Market Cap, Eyes on Visa Next


							

Ethereum has now surpassed Mastercard’s market valuation by around $15B.



This comes after ETH soared by 20% amid optimism about spot ETF approval.



If ETH cracks its ATH $4,891, its market cap will exceed that of Visa by $17B.




In a significant development, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has eclipsed the market valuation of Mastercard, a global leader in payment processing.



According to recent data, Mastercard’s market capitalization stands at $427.3 billion, reflecting a modest decline of 0.13% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market capitalization now exceeds $441.8 billion.



This surge comes after Ethereum’s price rallied by over 20% within the last few hours, reaching a two-month high of $3,714. While Ethereum has experienced a slight correction, settling at $3,678 at the time of writing, its market valuation remains comfortably ahead of Mastercard’s by $14.5 billion.



ETH market statistics | CoinMarketCap



The significant uptick in Ethereum’s price can be partly attributed to growing optimism surrounding the SEC’s approval of pending applications for Ethereum spot ETFs.



Specifically, the SEC has reportedly contacted at least one exchange and one potential issuer of an Ethereum spot ETF to request updates on their 19b-4 filings. Industry insiders familiar with the situation suggest that this could signal an increased likelihood of SEC approval.



Reflecting on these developments, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have revised upwards their prediction for SEC approval of an Ethereum spot ETF, from a 25% probability to a more optimistic 75%.



 
 




Following the SEC’s approval for Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $73,750 in March. A similar scenario is being contemplated for Ethereum.



Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market capitalization remains $128 billion below that of Visa, one of Mastercard’s closest competitors in the payment processing space. Notably, if Ethereum surpasses its 2021 all-time high of $4,891, its market valuation would reach $587 billion, exceeding that of Visa by $17.72 billion.

‘Nyan Heroes’ Launches Solana Token, Up 27% as Airdrop Claims Open - Decrypt

Nyan Heroes, a PC-based hero shooter on the Epic Games Store, launched its Solana-based NYAN token today, opening up its token claim for players who participated in the recent play-to-airdrop campaigns around the game.NYAN debuted on crypto exchange Bybit early Tuesday, as the game’s official launch partner following the Solana token generation event (TGE). The token popped over $0.46 with $22 million in early volume, and is currently priced at $0.30, per data from CoinMarketCap, with a market cap above $30 million as of this writing.Bybit is also hosting a rewards campaign, handing out 2.76 million NYAN tokens—about $828,000 worth at the current price—to customers who stake either NYAN, MNT, or USDT stablecoin within the exchange’s platform. The campaign runs for a full week, until May 28.Nyan Heroes developer 9 Lives Interactive also opened up airdrop claims on Tuesday for players who checked out the pre-alpha demo playtests via the Epic Games Store, or participated in other airdrop initiatives related the game.However, the team noted that there were technical problems with the claim process, with token distribution partner Streamflow claiming that “network issues” were at play as of 4am ET. It’s unclear whether the hitches have been resolved. Decrypt reached out to 9 Lives Interactive for clarification, but did not receive an immediate response.The pre-alpha demo, which is currently available to play through May 26 via the prominent PC gaming marketplace, lets players earn points for completing in-game missions, which then convert into allocations of the NYAN token. According to the team, the NYAN token can be used to mint in-game gear on-chain as an NFT, a process called “awakening” within the game world.“The NYAN token can also be utilized for marketplace transaction fees, rental fees for in-game assets, [and] competition entry fees,” reads a press release, “and players may lock their NYAN in order to receive additional special access, privileges, and rewards in addition to providing access to decentralized community governance.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

$386,330,000 Liquidated As Ethereum Rips Before Potential ‘Shock’ ETF Decision - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) has exploded in price on hopes of an approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Bitcoin rallied alongside ETH, and the sudden move has liquidated nearly $400 million worth of traders positions, according to current data from Coinglass.










The odds of an SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs were originally slim to none, but late on Monday, Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart announced they were raising the odds to 75%, up from 25%.
“Update: 
James Seyffart and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied).”
According to Washington, D.C.-based crypto legal expert Jake Chervinsky, the approval of an Ethereum ETF would be a “shock” to those close to Capitol Hill.
“If the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who’s close to this process.
That doesn’t mean it won’t happen.
It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy after the SAB (Staff Accounting Bulletin) 121 vote, perhaps more important than the ETF itself…
It’s hard to believe this SEC would do us any favors like approving the spot ETH ETF.
But policy is politics, and crypto has been winning the political battle for months.
Maybe the Biden camp saw how many voters Trump could win with one pro-crypto comment and decided to pivot.”
Reuters reported that “four people familiar with the matter” said the SEC has already asked Nasdaq, CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) and the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) to “fine-tune their applications” to list spot Ethereum ETFs, “signaling the agency may be poised to approve the filings.”
At time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,798.

New Development in the Massive GALA Hack - Founder Makes a Statement - Bitcoin Sistemi


The wallet address associated with the recent Gala Games (GALA) attack partially returned the stolen funds.
According to Onchain data, the wallet in question transferred back 5,913.2 ETH worth $22.5 million. This figure is close to the amount of GALA tokens sold immediately after the attack on Monday.


Earlier this week, an unknown hacker mined 5 billion GALA tokens worth over $200 million. This incident led to a 15% drop in the price of the platform's native token, GALA.
Eric Schiermeyer, co-founder of Gala Games, known online as Benefactor, announced that the attacker sold 600 million GALA, worth approximately $21 million at the time, and burned the remaining 4.4 billion tokens. He also added that Gala Games blocked and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract within 45 minutes of the attack.






“We messed up our internal controls,” Schiermeyer admitted.

“This should not have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it never happens again. We believe we have identified the culprit and are now working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities.”

In his statement on Discord, Schiermeyer added that the amount sent back by the hacker will probably be used for GALA token buybacks and burns.

Bitcoin price prediction: Will its next ATH be closer to $77K? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin price hit $71,000, leading the market to hit a fear and greed index of 76.
The liquidation heatmap pinpointed $76.900 as the next target for BTC.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hit $71,000 for the first time in almost 40 days, bringing optimism back to the market.  The price increase aligned with AMBCrypto’s recent analysis which explained how the bull run was not over.
Beyond the metrics mentioned in that article, there were other reasons BTC recovered. First on the register were the ETFs. For those unfamiliar, a Bitcoin ETF is not the same as BTC.
It, however, suggests that an investor has exposure to Bitcoin. As such, if the price of the cryptocurrency increases, then the ETF Net Asset Value (NAV), which represents the value of each share, would also increase.
The heavyweights are back
In the first quarter of 2024, billions of dollars flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, prompting the price to reach an all-time high before the halving. However, the issuers failed to attract the king of capital they once had during the first part of the second quarter.
As a result, BTC slumped, slipping below $59,00 at one point. However, that condition has changed for the better. As of the 20th of May, the total netflow into Bitcoin ETFs was $235 million.
This meant that ARK, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale had registered inflows for four straight days. If sustained, Bitcoin’s price could be in line to rise past $73,000 before the end of May.
Apart from this data, AMBCrypto looked at the fear and greed index. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index returned to 76— an 8.57% increase in the last 24 hours.
Source: Glassnode
This reading, represented by the color green, implies the market was in the greedy region. The last time BTC rallied to a new high, the metric hit 90— an extremely greedy (blue) region.
Liquidations pour in: What’s next for BTC?
As it stands, Bitcoin was not at a point where positive investor sentiment was exaggerated. With this position, the coin price might still appreciate, and rising close to $75,000 could be possible in a few days.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that $96.87 million worth of BTC contracts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. According to Coinglass, short liquidations accounted for almost $80 million while the rest were longs.
Source: Coinglass
For context, shorts are traders betting on the price of an asset to decrease. Longs, on the other hand, place bets on a price increase.
In addition, AMBCrypto analyzed the liquidation heatmap to check the next level for Bitcoin’s price to hit. Liquidation heatmap helps traders to identify areas of high liquidity.

If liquidity is concentrated in a region, price might move toward the point while large liquidations can also occur. According to data from Hyblock, high liquidity existed from $73,300 and above.
Therefore, Bitcoin could squeeze past its all-time high, and a target of $76,900 could be the next peak it hits.

                        In the year of the presidential election, Donald Trump tokens are gaining momentum in the DEX markets. Recently, a new Solana meme coin called ‘Super Trump’ has seen a significant surge – jumping to the top of meme coin markets.This article will provide an analysis of Super Trump’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new multi-chain dog coin, DOGEVERSE, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time.Super Trump went viral after being featured as a meme call amongst many popular crypto call channels.Super Trump Price Analysis: US Presidential Election Fuels Trump Token Popularity in Solana Meme Coin Markets
As price action fights to hold position, Super Trump is currently trading at a market price of $0.0006, down around 41% in the past 24 hours.The retracement move has eaten away at Super Trump’s rally since around 5PM (UTC) on May 20, with a quick-fire sell-off from early investors after the price hit an all-time high at $0.0043 (a jaw-dropping return of over 150,000% for the earliest backers).Amid this sell-off, price action hammered down in a much-needed price correction, leaving Super Trump trading in an accumulation zone between $0.0005 and $0.0007.So far, this has been a well-defended level by holders, with more than 12 hours of consolidation now established at these levels.Yet, Super Trump remains below overhead resistance from the downtrend, leaving holders targeting a further 2-4 hour period of consolidation before the downtrend is potentially invalidated.However, beyond the enduring meme value of a Trump-themed coin, there are strong reasons to be optimistic at these levels.Firstly, with early-backers flushed out by the sell-off, Super Trump can now rally further organically without significant risk of early-backer profit-taking behavior.Secondly, with the retracement move leaving Super Trump at a more alluring lower market cap of around $150k – late-stage retail capital could be enticed by a 10x gainer if previous price action repeats again.This is reflected in the growing buy-pressure in the order book, which has shifted to 52.5% of transactions in the past hour.But while holders sit tight, other investors are shifting their attention to a soon-to-launch multi-chain dogecoin project.Discover the Next Solana Meme Coin to Pump in May 2024: DOGEVERSE
While Super Trump offers a high-risk opportunity, the biggest gains can be accrued through presale opportunities, which position investors as early birds able to capture the lion’s share of project growth – just imagine investing in Super Trump before it hit the market and skyrocketed 15o,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last two weeks to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

GameStop Who? Ethereum ETF Hype Sends Crypto Memes Flying - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRemember last week's GameStop-fueled meme stock hype that helped propel meme coin prices? Well, the crypto narrative has already changed, and now it's Ethereum ETF hype that's juicing the markets... and yes, meme coins are again flying.After Ethereum (ETH) exploded with historic intensity late Monday, surging some 23% within hours amid renewed rumors around spot Ethereum ETF renewal, a few meme coins appear to have hitched a ride to the moon off the momentum—including, curiously, one of Solana’s most iconic meme tokens.Pepecoin (PEPE), one of Ethereum’s top meme coins, is up a whopping 32% in the last 24 hours. The streak has pushed PEPE to a new all-time high price above $0.0000128—albeit still worth a fraction of a cent. For the first time, also, the meme coin has surpassed a market capitalization of $5 billion. What caused the major bump? It appears PEPE is—almost exactly—mirroring ETH’s rise.After rumors began circulating yesterday that applications to trade spot ETH ETFs on Wall Street might soon be approved—rather than denied, as many expected—ETH instantly began climbing upwards yesterday afternoon. It hasn’t stopped yet, breaking $3,800 multiple times Tuesday morning. Down to the minute, Pepe began surging exactly when ETH took off yesterday afternoon. It’s unclear, though, what connection PEPE has to the ETH ETF saga, besides being one of the top meme coins on Ethereum. Meme coins are notably volatile and can be swayed by social media sentiment, however, so PEPE may be feeling the love as traders get hyped over ETH gains.The top two meme coins, however, had more marginal gains. Dogecoin, which runs on its own chain, is up 10% in the last 24 hours; Shiba Inu, the only Ethereum meme coin larger than PEPE, is up just under 6%. The other biggest beneficiary during ETH’s boom lives, curiously, over on Solana. There, BONK, one of Solana’s top meme coins, surged as much as 33% since yesterday, before settling, at writing, at a price that’s up 19% over the last 24 hours—but still worth a fraction of a penny at $0.00003127.BONK began surging a bit after ETH and PEPE did on Monday afternoon, by about two hours. Over the last day, however, it has kept pace with those coins’ gargantuan gains. Some attributed BONK’s rise to the conclusion of a weekly distribution of the token as part of a grants program. As others pointed out, however, there is still plenty more BONK to be distributed via other initiatives in the coming two years. SOL itself, meanwhile, is down 2% in the last day—but up almost 24% on the week.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market kicked off the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum’s (ETH) recent surge to $3800, causing notable gains across major altcoins.



Amid this surge, two cryptocurrencies are showing notable strong momentum. In this context Finbold turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heatmap from CoinGlass on May 21 to identify potential buy signals.



Uniswap (UNI) showing strong buy signal



Uniswap (UNI), the first automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange, remains the most popular and leads with the highest exchange volume and liquidity for trading Ethereum tokens. 







Currently trading at $9.52, UNI experienced a 22% gain driven by excitement over a potential Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval.



Crypto Market RSI Heatmap: UNI. Source: CoinGlass



In the past 24 hours, UNI’s price rose by 22% to $9.34, breaking out of a six-week correction and signaling a major market shift. RSI values (1 hour at 70.36, 4 hours at 83.05, and 12 hours at 79.71) indicate overbought conditions, usually a sell signal, but strong buying pressure suggests a buy signal.



Uniswap Labs, in collaboration with Across Protocol, introduced ERC-7683, a new standard for cross-chain intents enhancing UNI’s utility and market value. 



Technical indicators, like the 50- and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $8.35, provide strong support if the price reverts. 



The bullish divergence in daily RSI above 60% indicates continued buying pressure, making UNI a compelling buy



Strong momentum for Bonk (BONK)



Bonk is currently trading at $0.00003181, showing a 23.46% gain in the past day. Fueled by market excitement around the potential approval of ETH ETFs, Bonk recorded a 7.8% jump today, breaching the neckline resistance of $0.00003.



Crypto Market BONK Heatmap: UNI. Source: CoinGlass



The RSI values (1 hour at 61, 4 hours at 88, and 12 hours at 73) indicate strong buying pressure, with the sharp upswing in daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) highlighting aggressive buying activity.



These factors and technical indicators collectively present a strong buy signal for Bonk, making it an attractive investment opportunity.



While these cryptocurrencies show strong buy signals, it is important to exercise caution. The sustainability of this rally is uncertain, and many believe that a bearish correction is inevitable. 



Therefore, cryptocurrency investors should conduct thorough research and prioritize robust projects to ensure sound capital allocation.

Famous Philosopher Yuval Noah Harari Slams Bitcoin


Prominent Israeli philosopher Yuval Noah Harari, who is best known for his best-selling book "Sapiens," recently took aim at Bitcoin, slamming it as "a currency of distrust." Even though Bitcoin proponents might have good reasons to distrust the banks, their preference for the leading cryptocurrency is still based on the distrust of human institutions, Harari claims.The famous intellectual claims that this is an "alarming development" given that money is supposed to create trust between strangers. "I understand the causes for this distrust, but it is an alarming development,' he said. He hopes that humanity finds a way to build trustworthy human institutions in lieu of adopting technologies of distrust. The philosopher further added that humans control the world precisely because they learned to trust one another. He warned that algorithms could start controlling the world if humans put all their trust in them. "Farmers grow food. Shoemakers make shoes. What is the function of the financial system? Finance creates trust," Harari says. He adds that various financial systems are supposed to create trust between strangers who can cooperate on shared projects. "Originally, there was very little trust in institutions like banks and governments, so money was minted from gold. Since gold was scarce, this limited the amount of money and limited economic cooperation," he noted. Today, 90% of money is just computer data that cannot be easily comprehended by humans.  In March, Harari also argued against using artificial intelligence (AI) in finance. The philosopher warned that this technology could make financial regulation even less clear for humans. People should first gain an understanding of how AI operates and regulate it instead of integrating it into the financial system. According to Harari's philosophy, humanity is largely driven by myths that make large-scale collective cooperation possible.

Here Are All the Signs an ETH ETF Approval May Be Around the Corner - The Defiant

Rumors that the SEC is asking applicants to update filings and telling exchanges it's leaning to approve the rule change has sent ETH flying. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applicants have sprung into a flurry of activity as a major deadline towards the funds’ approval nears.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday reportedly directed major exchanges, including Nasdaq and CBOE, to refine their applications for listing spot Ether ETFs, indicating that the agency may be preparing to approve these applications.Barron’s reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that SEC staff informed exchanges on Monday it is leaning toward approving the products. The agency provided feedback on the applications, and if the issues are resolved promptly, approvals could be granted as early as this week, Barron’s reported.Financial asset management giant Fidelity filed an amended S-1 application on Monday, stating that ETH tokens underlying their spot ETFs will not be staked. Crypto asset manager Grayscale also filed an updated 19b-4 for their Ethereum Mini Trust, a spin-off of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which aims to convert the trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.This flurry of activity prompted Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to increase their odds that the SEC will approve the spot Ethereum ETFs by the May 23 deadline to 75%. The move prompted a massive rally in Ethereum’s native token, as a spot ETF traded in U.S. markets could potentially drive billions in inflows from institutional investors, as has been the case after the spot Bitcoin ETF was approved.ETH is up 19% in the past 24 hours to $3,733, the highest since March and just 23% away from its all-time high of $4,878, according to CoinGecko.ETH Price - CoinGeckoThis week, the SEC will review the applications filed by CBOE for Ether ETFs from VanEck and ARK Investments/21Shares. However, approval of the 19b-4 filings does not guarantee that the ETFs will be authorized. The S-1 applications must also be approved before the products can begin trading. If both the 19b-4 forms and the S-1 registration are approved, only then these funds can initiate trading.Forms S-1 and 19b-4The S-1, filed with the SEC, is a registration statement required for launching publicly traded securities products in the United States.The Form 19b-4, on the other hand, is used to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO). This form requests the SEC to approve new types of financial products or changes to existing rules, in this case, the listing of Ethereum ETFs.Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their odds for the approval of a spot Ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday, following reports of a potentially more favorable stance by the SEC.However, they later clarified that these odds were specific to the 19b-4 approvals.Standard Chartered, a financial institution managing over $800 billion in assets, said in a report it anticipates that the SEC will approve spot Ether ETFs by May 24.The list of ETF applicants awaiting SEC approval includes VanEck Ethereum ETF, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust Conversion, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, iShares Ethereum Trust, Franklin Ethereum ETF, and Bitwise Ethereum ETF.Not So EasyShould the SEC classify Ethereum as a security, it may result in the rejection of the spot Ether ETF applications because, according to securities regulations, any asset classified as a security must comply with strict requirements, including registration and disclosure obligations. A securities classification could impose significant legal and operational challenges on entities looking to offer financial products based on Ethereum.In the past, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has refrained from explicitly stating whether ETH is a security.Notably, the SEC does not prescribe a specific timeline for decisions on ETF applications, which could be a cause in the delay in the approval of spot Ether ETFs.Under Gensler's leadership, the SEC declined several spot Bitcoin ETF applications due to concerns about market manipulation.Despite these rejections, the SEC was compelled to approve Bitcoin ETF products following a successful court challenge by Grayscale Investments.Approval of the spot Ether ETFs would be a regulatory milestone and could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-related financial products.Still, Gensler said in a Jan. 10 statement that the Bitcoin ETF approval should “in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.”

The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)

It remains to be seen whether Biden will veto the measure, despite the fact that the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the SEC inappropriately imposed the guidance. However, the important thing here is that sane, bipartisan, crypto rulemaking is possible, despite the opposition of figures like arch crypto skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

A Whale Turned $83 into $79.4 Million on This Altcoin That ATH'd Today: 958,580x Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


PEPE, one of the new generation memecoins of the cryptocurrency world, experienced an impressive rally and managed to reach its all-time high today.
This rise in PEPE, the world's third-largest memecoin, is attributed to improving market sentiment as hopes grow that Ethereum Spot ETF products will be approved by the SEC.


PEPE price has risen over 30% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.00001267 at the time of writing.
However, the rise in PEPE also revealed that a whale has made an incredible amount of profit. According to data provided by Lookonchain, a cryptocurrency whale has still not sold the PEPE tokens he bought by paying only $ 83, and the value of the tokens he currently holds is at $ 79.4 million.






This means that the whale wallet made a profit of 958,580x. Whale wallet is one of the earliest investors in the popular memecoin.
The whale, which consists of three wallets belonging to the same person or institution, bought 6.44 trillion PEPE tokens by paying 0.041 ETH, or 83 dollars, and has not made any sales so far.

Analyst bullish on Floki as Pepe and Bonk rally - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Analyst picks Floki Inu over Pepe and Bonk as meme coins join the crypto party
Surging Bitcoin and Ethereum could help FLOKI price higher.
Technical picture also bullish for the meme coin as price nears.

Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) are up 33% and 24% respectively as the memecoin world bids to join the crypto party after Ethereum ETF news sparked a buying frenzy.
But while PEPE and BONK are standout performers among the top meme coins by market cap today, an analyst has shared some of the reasons to be bullish on Floki Inu (FLOKI).
“$PEPE and $BONK are both up over 34% today, showing that the memecoin economy is super strong,” crypto analyst Shelby noted via X.
While the two meme coins lead the gainers across the sector, the analyst points to Floki Inu (FLOKI) as one to watch.
According to Shelby, Pepe and Bonk’s massive spikes in the past 24 hours are a precursor of what the market could witness with Floki.
“I believe now is a good time to start paying attention to Floki,” Shelby noted, pointing to Floki’s standing as one of the top meme coins. 
Floki’s ecosystem growth, which includes key product updates, is also a factor to consider when analyzing its price potential down the road.
Floki Inu’s growth and the 2024 roadmap
Floki has witnessed steady growth since the team unveiled the project’s 2024 roadmap earlier this year. 
With part of the goal being to move Floki beyond the memecoin status, key developments to watch include staking, Floki debit cards and digital bank and the flagship utility product Valhalla.
In the market, Floki price recently surged by more than 13% amid a new DAO proposal that sought community approval to burn 15,246,000,000 FLOKI.
According to an announcement on Tuesday, that burn is set to occur on May 22, 2024 following a 99.84% vote approval.
Floki Inu price today
Today’s 11% gains come as Floki mirrors prices of top coins BTC and ETH, with sentiment positive amid the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs by the SEC. 
A sharp rise for cryptocurrencies due to an approval could catapult FLOKI higher. The token burn, as in the recent case, also adds to the positive outlook.
However, the technical picture also supports an upside continuation for FLOKI with momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hitting at bullish strength.

Floki Inu price is currently at $0.00022, its highest level since early April.

BREAKING: SEC Primed To Approve Ethereum ETFs This Week, Report Claims | Bitcoinist.com


								In a significant departure from their previous skeptical stance, US regulators are reportedly leaning toward approving the long-awaited spot Ethereum ETFs for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 
SEC Staff Signals Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval
According to a report by Barron’s, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff communicated to exchanges on Monday that they are leaning towards approving these products. 

The agency has provided comments and guidance on the ETF applications, and if the “outstanding issues” are resolved in time, approvals could be granted as early as this week.
Furthermore, the SEC’s recent engagement with exchanges further underscores the regulator’s consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs. The commission reportedly contacted the Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to request updates and modifications to existing applications before an upcoming regulatory deadline.
Of particular interest is VanEck’s spot Ether ETF, which has been pending SEC approval for the past 240 days. The commission is required to decide whether to approve or deny VanEck’s ETF by May 23. 
Shifting Landscape
The introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs would offer investors a more traditional and regulated route to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without the complexities associated with directly trading digital assets on cryptocurrency exchanges.
Suppose the SEC gives the green light to Ethereum spot ETFs. In that case, it will mark a significant milestone in the maturation and acceptance of Ethereum and the entire cryptocurrency market, as currently seen with the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF market in both Hong Kong and the US.
The regulatory approval of such spot Ethereum ETFs products will increase transparency, improve market liquidity and potentially attract institutional investors waiting for a regulated framework to participate in the growing digital asset space.

While the final decision rests with the SEC, the agency’s positive disposition towards Ethereum ETFs indicates a shifting regulatory landscape, recognizing the potential benefits and demand for such investment vehicles.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,730, up nearly 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $3,840 on Tuesday’s trading session.

SEC's Feedback Propels Ethereum ETF Listings Closer To Approval, Insiders Claim | Bitcoinist.com


								In a move that has the crypto community buzzing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked major exchanges to refine their applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. 
According to a Reuters report, sources familiar with the process say this request is interpreted as a positive signal that the regulator may be ready to greenlight these long-awaited products.
Ethereum ETF Approvals Inch Closer
The exchanges in question – Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE – have been working on submissions to list Ethereum ETFs provided by asset managers like VanEck and ARK Investments/21Shares. Typically, such regulatory feedback from the SEC precedes approval rather than rejection. 
“The SEC’s engagement with the exchanges on the ether ETF filings is a surprising and encouraging development for the crypto industry,” said one source who declined to be named.

This shift in the SEC’s stance marks a potential sea change, as the regulator had previously appeared skeptical about approving spot-based cryptocurrency ETFs. Its rejection of numerous Bitcoin ETF applications over the years, citing market manipulation concerns, dampened industry hopes.
However, the SEC was forced to greenlight Bitcoin futures ETFs last October after a court challenge from Grayscale Investments and spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Those products have since attracted significant interest from diverse investors, including hedge funds, wealth advisors, and retail traders.
Watershed Moment For Crypto Industry
The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs would be another major milestone for the crypto sector. ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has emerged as the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin.
“An SEC-approved Ethereum ETF would be a huge deal, providing investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency,” said an industry executive familiar with the matter.

Per the report, the SEC’s decision on the Ethereum ETF filings is expected by the end of this week. While the exchange applications are just the first step in the approval process, and the SEC still needs to sign off on the ETF registration statements, this latest development has fueled optimism within the crypto community.
“The SEC’s willingness to engage constructively with the exchanges on these filings is a clear indication that the regulator may be warming up to the idea of ether ETFs,” the industry source said. “This could be a major turning point for the crypto industry.”

As of the time of this reporting, ETH is trading at $3,780, having surged by a substantial 22% over the past 24 hours. This surge was driven by rising market expectations of imminent approval for the new ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

How a falling Yen could fuel a crypto market boom, per Arthur Hayes - AMBCrypto



A weakening Japanese Yen could fuel currency wars.
A US intervention could lead to liquidity injection, fueling the crypto market rally. 

BitMEX exchange founder and Maelstrom crypto fund CIO Arthur Hayes stated that the weakening Japanese Yen (JPY) could induce liquidity and boost Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto market. 
On his latest blog titled ‘Easy Button,’ the exec noted that, 
“I think that a USDJPY surge towards 200 is enough to put on the Chemical Brothers and “Push the Button.”
‘Chemical Brothers’ refers to the US and Japan, while ‘Push the Button’ means printing money or ‘injection of liquidity.’ 
At the time of writing, USDJPY traded at $156. The USD has strengthened against the Yen in 2024, with a YTD (year-to-date) performance of 10%. 
From the Yen’s perspective, the Japanese currency has depreciated massively in the past few months. 
How a depreciating Yen could boost crypto
According to Hayes, the plummeting Yen’s value could induce currency wars between Japan and China, forcing the US to intervene. 
For perspective, a dropping Yen means it will be cheaper for Japan to export more goods in bulk to the rest of the world. Such a move would make its exports very competitive compared to China’s. 
In retaliation, China could devalue its yuan (CNY) by printing more money to maintain its export advantage and stabilize the CNYUSD to the desired level.
 According to Hayes, the US could intervene and strengthen the Yen by devaluing the USD by increasing its supply. 
‘To weaken the dollar, its supply must increase. Imagine the Japanese needed $1 trillion worth of firepower to strengthen the yen from 156 to 100 overnight.’
The ripple effect is a surge in the price of dollar-based assets due to increased supply in USD. Collectively, with an uptick in Yuan (CNY), a ‘crypto boom’ could be likely. 
‘Crypto booms, as there is more dollar and yuan liquidity floating in the system’
Additionally, per Hayes, the above currency devaluation will be ripe for Bitcoin’s upswing because it is the ‘best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement.’
That said, this isn’t the first time the executive has predicted favorable macro conditions for crypto to rally. 
Hayes previously asserted that the US elections could increase US liquidity, which could drive risk-on assets, including BTC.

Apeiron embraces competitiveness to drive Web3 gaming growth - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Web3 game Apeiron announced the start of its Guild Wars tournament on May 21, featuring a $1 million prize pool. The competition will start with different regional online preliminaries up until June 25, followed by an in-person showdown set to happen in Hong Kong in Q3.Frank Cheng, co-founder of Apeiron, explained to Crypto Briefing that the Guild Wars tournament taps into the competitive nature of the game. 
“The game is in real-time and there’s an action element that you can directly control the movements of your main avatar, and you can also use cards depending on the situation in real-time. So it’s quite like Clash Royale and Warcraft Rumble,” said Cheng.
Fostering a competitive landscape for Apeiron is a major strategy for the team, as this is a key component to attract more players, streamers, and casters into the ecosystem. “Apeiron is a game that’s fun to play and watch at the same time. A lot of our upcoming exhibitions and our launch events will be centered around competition.”The $1 million prize pool will be split equally between cash and NFTs and will be destined for the top guilds. The event is open to the entire Web3 community and is already attracting major guilds, such as Avocado DAO and GuildFi.Why Ronin?Apeiron was initially deployed on Polygon’s infrastructure, but the team pivoted the project to Ronin in December 2023. Cheng explains that one of the reasons behind this movement is the potential Ronin ecosystem offers for partnerships. 
“In Web3, I think one of the most important things among developers is collaboration. And being in the Ronin Network is like being part of a family. And it’s important that we support not just SkyMavis and Axie Infinity, but other Ronin chain games in the ecosystem. We will do partnerships, we will do collabs. It’s a very founder-friendly environment that I only came to understand after the decision that we migrated to Ronin.”
Apeiron’s co-founder adds that Ronin presents itself as a very dedicated team, with broad support, such as marketing and technology, something that some blockchains lack nowadays.Moreover, Cheng praises the user-friendly wallet that Ronin was able to offer their users, which he assesses is fit for mobile gamers, a niche treated as the propelling factor for gaming.
“Mobile gamers, Asian gamers, this is where we see probably the earliest adoption happening compared to Steam console games. I think mobile game players are probably more receptive to blockchain operations and payments and micro-transactions. So mobile is something that we want. […] I’d say they are actually one of the most powerful and user-friendly mobile gaming wallets.”

New York Man Arrested for Swindling $1,300,000 in Scheme Involving Fictitious Crypto Wallet - The Daily Hodl


								A New York man pled guilty to fraud charges last week after using various fake crypto and real estate schemes to swindle investors out of more than $1.3 million.
Thomas John Sfraga, who went by the alias “T.J. Stone,” defrauded more than a dozen victims, including friends and neighbors, according to an announcement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.










Sfraga painted himself as a serial entrepreneur with experience in real estate development, media relations, podcasting and cryptocurrencies. He also claimed that he emceed crypto events in New York City.
To facilitate his fraud, Sfraga pretended to own multiple businesses, which he called Vandelay Contracting Corp. and Build Strong Homes LLC.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office notes that Vandelay could have been named after Vandelay Industries, a fictitious company in the television show “Seinfeld.”
Sfraga bilked victims in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Long Island by pretending to purchase, renovate and flip residential properties. He also defrauded a victim into investing in a fake crypto wallet and convinced an investor to sink $100,000 in cash to prop up a non-existent construction project.
But instead of making legitimate investments, Sfraga used the funds to enrich himself and pay older investors.
Sfraga faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and has been ordered to pay restitution of more than $1.33 million.

CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action

It's a very tough, difficult topic because there's a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it's relatively new, but we've seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it's certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don't touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that's against federal law. There are a number of people who really don't like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.

Democrats To Abruptly Reverse Party Stance on Crypto To Avoid Election Disaster: Mike Novogratz - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of the crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital says Democrats are changing their tune on crypto as the 2024 US Presidential election approaches.
In a new interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mike Novogratz says the Biden administration is listening to the markets and shifting its standpoint on crypto.










“But assuming, you know, the market is right, and the market is usually pretty smart, it feels like someone at the Biden White House made a call and said, guys, we can’t be the party against crypto anymore. 
I think that’s a seismic shift. If those things actually happen, prices are going to be much higher than here.”
When asked to clarify the meaning of his speculation, Novogratz doubled down, saying the Democrats don’t want crypto to cost them the election.
“I am sensing a widespread shift amongst Democrats that don’t want to let crypto be a big election issue. The crypto super PACs (Political Action Committees) have raised over $150 million, and they have targeted Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester, elections that matter dearly to Democrats in swing states, in vulnerable Senate seats. 
Crypto should be bipartisan. And quite frankly, for our industry to do well, it needs to be bipartisan. And it has been really Elizabeth Warren and a small group of people that have held the Democrats hostage on this. What the Senate broadly said, Chuck Schumer being the Senate leader who voted to overturn against Elizabeth, was, enough, enough. Like, this is becoming dumb. 
And so I’m sensing a real shift.”

Ether Futures Surge to Record Highs as Open Interest Tops $14 Billion


							

Ether futures open interest on centralized exchanges has hit a record $14 billion.



Daily open interest in Ether futures has risen 40% since early 2024.



Optimism for a spot Ether ETF approval has increased, with analysts raising SEC approval odds from 25% to 75%.




Ether’s open interest futures on centralized exchanges (CEX) have surpassed their previous highs, reflecting increased trading volume. Open interest (OI) measures the aggregated number of open positions in a particular contract, making it a key indicator of market sentiment, liquidity, and investor sentiment.



According to insights from CoinGlass, ETH Open Interest futures hit an all-time high of $14 billion on Tuesday. This marked a significant increase in the total value of all Ether’s outstanding contracts.



On a year-to-date, daily open interest in ether futures has risen 40% from its initial $10 million valuation. Equally, Ether held price gains in its previous intraday session, surging by 21% to trade at $ 3,783, per data from Coincodex.










The major driver of this positive trend is the renewed optimism surrounding the approval of spot Ether ETFs.  As a result, ETF analysts, particularly Bloomberg’s James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have revised their estimations of the SEC approving spot ether ETFs, raising their estimations from 25% to 75%. Balchunas stated:




“Update: JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied),” 




Previously, Balchunas estimated the chances of an Ether ETF approval to be 25% in March, down from 70% in January. Co-analyst Seyffart also expressed scepticism regarding the approval, pointing to inactivity from key entities before the May 23 deadline set by the SEC.



The agency requested that issuers update and resubmit Form 19b-4 documents, which require regulatory clearance before launching spot ether ETFs. In line with this, the first wave of applications is expected this week, with VanEck’s due and Ark Invest/21Shares’ individual deadlines on the 23rd and 24th, respectively.

Uniswap Labs claims SEC will fail, urges agency to drop enforcement action - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Uniswap Labs has urged the SEC to drop its pending enforcement action against the company. Arguing through a response to the agency’s Wells notice, Uniswap Labs CLO Martin Ammori said that the SEC would have to redefine what an exchange is to have jurisdiction over Uniswap.The SEC’s Wells notice was issued to Uniswap Labs in April, accusing the Uniswap protocol of being an unregistered securities exchange and the interface and wallet of being unregistered securities brokers.A Wells notice is a formal notification issued by the SEC or other securities regulators to inform individuals or companies of completed investigations where infractions have been discovered. This signals the agency’s intention to recommend legal action against Uniswap as it builds its case to pursue the company for alleged violations of federal securities laws.“These assertions assume that value represented in a specific digital file format is a security – and that the SEC can unilaterally extend the definitions of exchanges, brokers and contracts,” Uniswap states in the blog post published Tuesday.Uniswap Protocol, as developed by Uniswap Labs, operates the application and interface for Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built over the Ethereum blockchain.Legal contentionsAccording to Ammori, Uniswap’s legal strategy revolves around challenging the SEC’s authority to regulate the Uniswap Protocol and its associated products based on the definition of securities and exchanges.The company asserts that the majority of digital assets traded on the Uniswap Protocol do not constitute securities under federal law. Uniswap contends that the SEC has failed to provide clear guidance on which specific assets it deems to be securities, creating an atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty for DeFi projects.Uniswap also notes that the decentralized nature of the Uniswap Protocol renders it immune to the regulator’s oversight, arguing that its autonomous operation precludes the company from being held responsible for ensuring compliance with securities laws. The company maintains that, as a decentralized protocol, Uniswap is not controlled by any single entity, including Uniswap Labs itself.“The Protocol is not controlled by, or comprised of, any “group of persons,” let alone Universal Navigation Inc. (“Uniswap Labs” or “Labs”). Labs initially developed the Protocol, but the Protocol is open-source and fully autonomous. Labs cannot change the Protocol’s core code,” Uniswap states in its Wells notice response.Another notable contention is with Rule 3b-16, which expands the definition of “exchange” to include DeFi protocols. Uniswap claims that this set of proposed changes are unlawful.Uniswap says that the proposed amendments to Rule 3b-16 misinterpret the Exchange Act and thus run counter to the original intent of Congress. There’s also the contention that the proposed rule points to a violation of the separation of powers under the major questions doctrine and the non-delegation doctrine, as it represents a significant expansion of the SEC’s regulatory authority without explicit congressional approval.Uniswap argues that the proposed rule fails to provide fair notice to regulated parties, potentially infringing on the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution.The company also asserts that the proposed amendments are “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as the SEC has not adequately justified its position or considered the potential consequences for the DeFi industry.SEC’s previous actions against UniswapIn September 2021, it was reported by Reuters that the SEC had launched an investigation into Uniswap Labs, the developer of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.According to the report, the SEC was seeking information about how investors use the Uniswap exchange and how it is marketed. The regulator’s focus appeared to be on gathering information rather than alleging any wrongdoing at the time.The news of the SEC’s investigation into Uniswap Labs came amidst increasing regulatory interest in the DeFi space. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had previously hinted at the need for greater oversight of DeFi projects, particularly those that offer incentives or digital tokens to participants.At the time, Gensler argued that even in the absence of a central entity controlling a decentralized exchange, DeFi projects with governance structures and fees could still fall under the purview of SEC regulation. This stance signaled the agency’s intent to apply existing securities laws to the emerging DeFi ecosystem.The SEC’s investigation into Uniswap Labs followed its first enforcement action involving securities using DeFi technology in August 2021, when it charged Blockchain Credit Partners with raising $30 million through allegedly fraudulent offerings.The regulatory scrutiny faced by Uniswap Labs in 2021 foreshadowed the ongoing legal battle between the company and the SEC, which has since escalated with the recent issuance of a Wells notice.The earlier investigation and the subsequent enforcement action against Blockchain Credit Partners demonstrates the SEC’s growing interest in asserting its authority over the DeFi industry and applying securities laws to decentralized projects.Uniswap’s Wells notice response also highlighted the potential consequences of the SEC’s actions, stating that bringing a case against Uniswap would “push” American crypto investors to use foreign trading protocols and discourage future innovators from fostering competition and innovation in financial markets.Ammori emphasized that Uniswap Labs is prepared to litigate if necessary and is confident in its ability to win, but hopes that the SEC will recognize that its current strategy is not protecting anyone or benefiting Americans.Uniswap Labs will be represented in court by Andrew Ceresney, the SEC’s former head of enforcement. Ceresney represented Ripple in its case with the SEC. Former US solicitor general Don Verrili, who represented Grayscale in its case against the SEC, will also join Uniswap’s legal team.

SKALE Labs names veteran Andrew Saunders as its new CMO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            SKALE Labs, the entity behind the gasless blockchain SKALE, has announced the appointment of Andrew Saunders as its Chief Marketing and Growth Officer. Saunders’ previous roles include Global Head of Entertainment and Culture at Amazon, Vice President of Content Innovation and Creative at NBCUniversal, and the first CMO at Arbitrum.According to the April edition of the “DappRadar Games Report,” SKALE showed 197,000 unique daily active wallets last month, being the fifth largest blockchain by user activity. Despite showing the numbers, market awareness around SKALE is not keeping up with what the project is building, something Jack O’Holleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, recognizes.“When you look at DappRadar rankings, SKALE is in the top five pretty much every day in terms of unique active wallets and transaction volume. If not five, it’s in the top ten almost every single day. But then you go look at where we rank in terms of our awareness among the broader market and we’re not there in the top five or ten,” shared O’Holleran with Crypto Briefing. However, he highlights that SKALE has “huge awareness” among builders in crypto. “That tells me that we have an amazing opportunity now to take this foundational structure and strength and developer attention and fundamentals and then drive that awareness. So I’m incredibly excited that we have our first ever CMO and the reality is you look at Andrew’s track record and what he did at Arbitrum and what he’s done at other points in his career, he is the absolute perfect person to come here and drive our awareness through the roof.”Without revealing too much of his playbook, Saunders explained that there are more to marketing and growth in crypto than a professional background in the sector. In other words, being a trader and an investor also plays a huge part in spreading awareness about a protocol.“I like to consider myself a little bit of a Web 2.5 marketer. And so what you’ll probably see is things that you’ve seen in Web2, things that you’ve seen in Web3, but them coming together in maybe non-traditional and more interesting ways. And that’s always been how I’ve been,” said Saunders.Moreover, SKALE’s new Chief Marketing and Growth Officer stated that he’s fond of experimentation, as he was the first marketer to put brands on Netflix. Therefore, users can expect “out of the box” initiatives from Saunders.Two “luxury problems”One of the core characteristics related to blockchain technology is the fee concept. To send messages on a blockchain, be it a transaction or a smart contract interaction, fees must be paid to the infrastructure in use. Otherwise, validators would have no incentives to secure the network, users would be able to spam transactions and damage the network, and many other bad scenarios.Consequently, SKALE’s idea of ‘gasless’ might rub some users the wrong way, although the network isn’t based on totally free interactions. “Frankly, the architecture is complicated. It’s not easy to explain. And the easiest explanation is, hey, guess what? There’s still fees being paid, but there are chain fees and not individual gas fees. So the developer can pay instead of the end user. Because if you don’t have fees, you have no economic sustainability,” stated O’Holleran.This issue, along with the lack of awareness among crypto users, is called by SKALE Labs’ CEO as “two luxury problems.” “We have amazing fundamentals, and not enough people know about us. We have amazing technology, that’s complex and difficult to message. Those are two problems that marketing solves, and that’s why Andrew’s on board.”The best way to solve the complexity issue is by making people focus on the products developed on top of SKALE’s infrastructure, explained Saunders. As an example, he mentions mainstream games available on the Epic Games marketplace, which offers high-quality games and players are not interested in knowing which engine was used to develop them.“I’m not seeing any of this on the backend. I’m just playing the game, and it’s operating. It’s never crashing,” added Saunders. By offering seamless experiences like this one, the gasless discussion becomes obsolete.

Fantasy.Top Creators to Receive Nearly 600 ETH in Rewards - The Defiant

Heroes featured in the on-chain trading card game have collectively earned almost 600 ETH, but not everyone is happy.
Fantasy.Top, the trading card and fantasy sports hybrid built on Ethereum Layer 2 Blast, has just distributed its second round of in-game rewards to creators.Creators are set to receive 600 ETH worth of rewards by May 24. Creators are now able to claim their share of ETH royalties, Blast Gold, which is akin to Blast points, and Fantasy Stars, an in-game reward with a currently unknown use case.Creators in the Fantasy.Top ecosystem, known as heroes, earn royalties and other in-game rewards based on their card’s performance and trading volume.Fantasy Top TweetThe first round of creator royalties was distributed on May 6, and a window has now opened from May 21 to May 23 for Heroes to claim their rewards.Fantasy.Top founder Travis Bickle said “We want to match the on-chain claim with an option for heroes to share their rewards granularly with their card holders” in an interview.Heroes are entitled to a 1.5% fee of trading volume on their card, and a split of 10% of the total mint revenues. Total trading fees have been volatile, but have declined by over 50% between May 13 to May 19. Minting fees have declined drastically since Fantasy.Top’s inaugural week, seeing a drop of over 90% since May 7. If these trends continue the accrual of Hero royalties is also expected to slow down.Fantasy.Top is currently one of the top 15 revenue generating dApps in DeFi over the last 30 days. The protocol has amassed $12.2m in fees and revenue since its launch day on May 1, solidifying it as the highest earning Blast-native dApp at this time.Daily Minting and Trading FeesDespite earning ETH royalties, Blast Gold, and in-game rewards, some creators have voiced concerns over the lack of clarity on both the scoring algorithm and rewards distributions.Well known investor Gmoney said “my unsolicited advice for @fantasy_top_ is to make how scoring is calculated public so people can base decisions on knowing who gets what…”.Bickle responded with a quote tweet from May 17, where he said “we will probably disclose more information on how the score gets calculated” once they have settled on their preferred scoring models.

Tom Emmer Opposes 'Un-American' CBDC 'Used Like The Chinese Use The Digital Yuan' - Benzinga

Representative Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) on Tuesday voiced strong opposition to the potential implementation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States without stringent Congressional oversight and adherence to fundamental American values.What Happened: In an interview with Bloomberg, Emmer emphasized the critical need for any proposed CBDC to be open, permissionless, and private, aligning with the freedoms enjoyed by traditional cash.Emmer’s stance comes at a time when discussions around CBDCs are intensifying globally, with countries like China already advancing their digital currency projects. “We can’t have that in this country. That’s un-American,” Emmer said, referencing the Chinese government’s use of digital yuan as a surveillance tool, which monitors citizens’ purchases and behavior to build social scores.The Congressman underscored the potential risks associated with a government-issued digital currency that does not protect individual privacy and freedom. “Any digital currency issued by the government must be open, permissionless and private,” Emmer insisted. “It can’t be used like the Chinese are using the digital yuan.”Also Read: Diamonds As Digital Currency? How This Innovation Could Revolutionize PaymentsWhy It Matters: Emmer’s bill, currently on the floor, mandates that the federal government must seek authorization from Congress before creating a CBDC.This legislation aims to ensure that any digital currency introduced will not infringe on the privacy rights of American citizens. The bill specifies that such a currency must emulate the characteristics of cash, preserving anonymity and preventing governmental overreach.The proposal has garnered attention amid broader regulatory debates concerning digital assets. Emmer’s emphasis on maintaining privacy and preventing surveillance aligns with growing concerns about the balance between innovation and regulation in the digital currency space.What’s Next: As the debate continues, industry leaders, investors, and policymakers are set to converge at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will provide a platform to discuss the implications of regulatory decisions on digital assets, including the potential impact of CBDCs on the financial system.Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowImage: Shutterstock

                        Hong Kong police arrested on Tuesday three individuals linked to a fraud syndicate that allegedly defrauded at least 10 residents out of HK$5.1 million (US$653,900) through fake virtual investment talk tickets.Authorities revealed that the victims were deceived into bidding for fake tickets to a virtual investment talk show with the intention of reselling them for a profit.Hong Kong Police Arrest Three in Fake Virtual Investment Seminar Ticket Scam
Police reported that the syndicate invited targets to an investment seminar at a grade-A office in Kowloon Bay. The scammers lured the attendees into a fraud scheme with promises of high returns and no risk, bidding on admission tickets for an investment talk show through a sham trading platform controlled by the syndicate.Acting Superintendent Man Cheuk-hei of the Sau Mau Ping district stated that the scammers persuaded the victims to deposit money into a bogus trading platform, promising a monthly return of 7% interest. The syndicate, which began operations in November 2022, faces charges of conspiracy to defraud, which carries a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. Police seized five mobile phones and cash amounting to HK$15,000 and 30,000 yuan (US$4,145).Inspector Tam Ho-yin of the Sau Mau Ping district crime squad explained that the bidding for each ticket started at 100 Tether coins, equivalent to HK$780. Victims were told they could sell the tickets the next day at a markup of 300 Tether coins but faced high handling fees for their bids. As the bidding price increased, the fraudsters claimed they would eventually repurchase all tickets at an inflated price of 15,000 Tether coins.“The money supposedly won by the victims during this process belonged to other victims,” Tam said. Some victims, who made profits, introduced their family and friends to the scheme. The trading platform ceased operations when the syndicate could not find new targets, leaving those who remained with substantial losses.Tam added that when victims tried to withdraw money, scammers made excuses and refused. Fraudsters even demanded exorbitant administrative fees before processing any requests. Notably, the police urged other potential victims to come forward. Hong Kong SFC and Police Force Partner to Combat Crypto Scams
Hong Kong has seen a major rise in fraud cases, with a 42.6 percent increase in reports last year, totaling 39,824 cases compared to 27,923 in 2022. Financial losses from these cases surged by 89 percent, reaching HK$9.1 billion in 2023, up from HK$4.8 billion the previous year.In response to the growing number of scams in Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency space, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Police Force have partnered to tackle the issue. The collaboration was solidified during their meeting on September 28. The primary objective of this newly established group is to monitor unlawful activities associated with virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) within Hong Kong territory.A major catalyst for the initiative was the ongoing scrutiny of the JPEX exchange, the biggest fraud case in Hong Kong’s history. Accusations have surfaced that JPEX was advertising its services without securing the necessary license from the SFC. The oversight and other illicit activities allegedly resulted in losses of approximately $166 million, affecting over 2,086 investors.To prevent individuals from falling victim to scams involving bogus and unlicensed crypto platforms, the SFC has made public a list of licenses, encompassing unlicensed and suspect VATPs and those on the verge of shutting down. The list also features VATPs currently awaiting SFC approval.

DOGE To The Moon: Dogecoin Beats Out Cardano And XRP In This Major Metric | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin (DOGE) has come out on top over Cardano and XRP following a recent development highlighting each token’s growth. This could reflect positively on the meme coin’s price soon enough, given how much crypto users look to be invested in the crypto token.  
Dogecoin Experiences The Second-Largest Network Growth
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin has experienced the second-largest network growth in the past six months. Currently, 6.6 million wallets are said to be holding the meme coin, representing a 27% growth over this period. DOGE is only behind Toncoin (TON), which has recorded a 110% growth over the last six months, with 16,800 wallets holding the crypto token. 

Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, Dogecoin topped other major cap crypto tokens, with XRP and Cardano recording 7% and 0% network growth, respectively. The meme coin also surpassed the foremost crypto tokens, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have grown 10% and 11% in the last six months, respectively. 
Dogecoin’s network growth is expected to reflect positively on DOGE’s price since many crypto users are adopting the meme coin. This will likely trigger significant price surges for Dogecoin as these investors continue to accumulate the crypto token. The increased interest in Dogecoin isn’t surprising, given that meme coins are one of the leading narratives for this bull run.
Therefore, these investors are likely positioning themselves with DOGE, as the foremost meme coin, expected to gain massively from the meme coin hype. DOGE has so far enjoyed a year-to-date (YTD) of over 77% but looks to be still far from achieving its full potential, with crypto analysts like Ali Martinez predicting that it can rise to $1 in this market cycle.  
Dogecoin’s fundamentals are also as bullish as ever, with the meme coin set to gain more utility. Automotive company Tesla recently integrated DOGE payments to purchase specific merchandise on its website. Meanwhile, there continue to be rumors that Dogecoin will likely be integrated into X payments due to Elon Musk’s fondness for the meme coin. 
DOGE’s Outlook On The Chart Is Bullish
Crypto analyst Kevin Capital (formerly Yomi OG) recently provided a bullish outlook for Dogecoin from a technical analysis perspective. He revealed in an X post that Dogecoin is about to receive a 2-month MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) cross to the upside for the second time in history. 

Source: Santiment
The crypto analyst mentioned that Dogecoin began a “massive bull market to $0.74” the last time this happened. This raises the possibility of the meme coin rising even higher this time around. In the meantime, DOGE looks headed for $0.22 as Kevin Capital revealed that the crypto token is breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern, which could send it to this price level.

Economist Alex Krüger Says ‘Base Case’ Is Ethereum at New All-Time Highs, Bitcoin Much Higher by Year End - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed trader and economist Alex Krüger believes Ethereum (ETH) is headed to new all-time highs (ATHs) due to one key catalyst.
Krüger tells his 175,400 followers on the social media platform X that a possible approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) as early as this week could send the top altcoin soaring.










The odds for an ETH ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suddenly increased this week, and ETH rallied by more than 20% in the past day.
He also believes Bitcoin (BTC) will be “much higher” before the end of 2024.
“My base case scenario has been: 

Bitcoin much higher into year-end. 
Ethereum underperforming due to an ETF rejection. 
Ethereum over-performing from the US elections onwards, as elections would lead to a [SEC Chair Gary] Gensler removal and subsequent ETF approval in 2025. 

An ETH ETF approval this week would push everything forward. [May 21st’s] move was just the market repositioning and shorts closing (see open interest chart below), as almost nobody had been expecting an approval. Then would come the inflows, which would push ETH into ATHs. Do not fade an approval. It is not even remotely priced in. The market would likely shift back into ‘you really are a genius mode.’ With ETH leading for a while. Even after today ETH/BTC is still red year-to-date. Time for it to continue much higher. 
Note: even if now unlikely, if the ETF gets rejected, we are in for a world of pain. Keep alerts on during US hours until the 23rd.”
Source: Alex Krüger/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,809 at time of writing, up more than 22% in the last 24 hours. ETH reached its ATH of about $4,900 in November 2021.
Krüger suspects the SEC is facing political pressure to approve the ETH ETF applications due to the politics around the US presidential election in November.
“Many will disagree but I do believe the SEC’s seeming change in stance was politically driven, coming from the top of the Democratic party and with elections in mind. Possibly triggered by Trump’s sudden support of crypto, forcing the Dems hands.”

Another Blow to the SEC? Harsh Statements from Altcoin Under Threat of Lawsuit - Bitcoin Sistemi

Uniswap Labs, the company behind the largest decentralized crypto exchange Ethereum, has called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its planned lawsuit against them, arguing that the fight is not worth it.
In April, Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice from the SEC, a warning that the regulator believed the company was violating the law. In the notice, the Uniswap protocol was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, while its interface and wallet were accused of being an unregistered securities broker.


In response to the SEC's Wells notice, Uniswap Labs disputed these allegations. The company argues that the protocol does not meet the definition of an exchange and is therefore not subject to SEC regulation. Although Uniswap Labs developed the protocol, it argues that the protocol is now a “passive” technology used for cryptocurrency trading.
Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer Martin Ammori stated that the SEC must redefine the concept of an exchange to have jurisdiction over Uniswap. According to the current definition, Uniswap should have been designed specifically for securities trading. “It is general purpose and the majority of its volume consists of non-security assets such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and stablecoins,” Ammori said, noting that these assets constitute 65% of the protocol's transaction volume.






Ammori also pointed out that the SEC's current exchange definition does not include any of Uniswap Labs' products. He explained that the SEC is currently trying to redefine several terms in its regulations to try to catch them, and that he believes this move exceeds the authority given to the SEC by Congress.
Additionally, Ammori rejected the SEC's claim that Uniswap's interface and wallet are brokers, citing a recent federal court decision rejecting the SEC's claim that Coinbase Wallet is an unregistered securities broker.

Uniswap responds to SEC Wells notice, says litigation is not the path forward - Blockworks


DeFi platform Uniswap Labs responded on Tuesday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had notified the company last month that enforcement actions were imminent.
In a 43-page submission, Uniswap made its case to the SEC on why the regulator should not take legal action against them. Uniswap last month revealed it has been served a Wells notice, which typically precedes an SEC enforcement action. 
Uniswap is not an exchange, the company stated in its response to the SEC. It emphasized that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate bitcoin, ether or stablecoins, which are the primary assets traded on the Uniswap protocol.
Read more: SEC signals to Uniswap that enforcement actions are looming
Uniswap argued that tokens traded on its platform are not securities but rather alternative assets such as stablecoins, community and utility tokens, and commodities. Uniswap also pointed out that — per its decentralized nature — the protocol does not maintain user accounts or collect personal data, complicating the SEC‘s push for increased transparency and regulatory oversight​.
“Bringing this case would encourage Americans to use harder-to-regulate foreign interfaces and trading protocols, while also discouraging future innovators from attempting to foster new ideas that bring much needed competition and innovation to financial and commercial markets,” Uniswap wrote in the submission. 
Uniswap added that Congressional intervention is needed to regulate the crypto industry, and the SEC “cannot obtain its desired answers through litigation.”

Uniswap’s response comes a month after Consensys preemptively sued the SEC after receiving its own Wells notice. In the suit, the crypto company alleges the securities regulator overstepped its authority and failed to provide regulatory clarity for the industry. 
Consensys claims the SEC has been investigating Ethereum and ether’s potential status as a security for over a year. The crypto firm claims that SEC director of the division of enforcement Gurbir Grewal in March 2023 approved a Formal Order of Investigation into the buying and selling of ether. Formal Orders allow the agency to issue subpoenas and collect witness testimony under oath.
Uniswap’s response also follows news that exchange Robinhood was served a Wells notice earlier this month. The US securities regulator is interested in Robinhood Crypto’s “cryptocurrency listings, custody of cryptocurrencies, and platform operations,” in addition to “other topics.” 
“The potential action may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding and may seek remedies that include an injunction, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and censure, revocation, and limitations on activities,” Robinhood said earlier this month. 
The SEC has declined to comment on both Uniswap and Robinhood’s Wells notices and any pending enforcement actions.

Uniswap Hits Back at SEC, Says It's Ready to Fight in Court


Decentralized exchange giant Uniswap has filed its response to the Wells notice it recently received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Uniswap has accused the agency of attempting to significantly expand its jurisdiction so that it covers all digital value. According to Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, the SEC wants to become "the world internet police.""This SEC’s reckless approach to crypto has not protected consumers and has caused immeasurable harm in the US - to individuals, businesses, and the state itself. We should lead on internet innovation, not stifle it," Adams said. Uniswap claims that it is not required to be registered as a broker. It has predicted that the SEC's authority over technology will be further narrowed due to its decision to litigate this issue. The defendant insists that the underlying transactions on the protocol are not securities transactions, comparing Uniswap to Coinbase Wallet. In March, U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla ruled that the latter was not conducting brokerage activities.Furthermore, Uniswap claims that it does not solicit users to perform swaps on the protocol, adding that its general public statements do not amount to solicitation. In addition, the defendant has stated that it does not provide advice to the users of the protocol or the interface. Uniswap neither acts as a depository nor engages in clearing activity, according to its response. The SEC suggested that Uniswap's contracts serve as depositories for securities. The distribution of the native UNI token was also addressed in the lawsuit, with Uniswap stating that it does not satisfy the requirements of the Howey test in order to be recognized as a securities offering. Adams has stated that Uniswap is "ready to fight" the SEC in court. As reported by U.Today, it was sued by the agency in April.

Ethereum Futures Market Breaks Record as ETF Euphoria Ensnares Traders - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsOpen interest for Ethereum futures contracts hit $15.5 billion on Tuesday following rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission was closer to approving ETH exchange-traded funds this week.The sudden blast of optimism has fueled a rush of upward movement across markets, and CoinGlass data shows that open interest on all crypto exchanges was at a record of 4.13 million ETH—surging by 32% in 24 hours.Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers told Decrypt that the trading volume was “unprecedented.”“This surge [in futures trading] reflects the heightened market activity and interest as traders and investors position themselves to capitalize on the potential approval,” Strijers said. In the derivatives market, futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specific price at a later date. They allow traders to speculate on movements in an asset’s price.It’s a marked turnaround for the second largest cryptocurrency after months of hand wringing. Until this week, it was expected by industry observers and analysts that the SEC would not approve a spot ETH exchange traded fund (ETF) by the May 23 deadline. But yesterday, ETF analysts at Bloomberg said that they had heard Wall Street’s biggest regulator would go ahead and give the green light to the funds after fund managers started updating paperwork for the potential products. The price of ETH has rocketed as a result: ETH is currently trading at $3,752, according to CoinGecko, having shot up 19% in 24 hours. And it isn’t only ETH that is doing well: almost every other coin and token is up. Bitcoin, the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency, yesterday rocketed to over $70,000 per coin. It’s since dropped and is priced at $69,753. Meme coins and tokens have also surged, as have altcoins like Solana and Avalanche. Lots of top asset managers have filed paperwork with the SEC to release a spot ETH ETF in the United States.If approved, ordinary investors could get exposure to ETH by buying shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency, which is the second biggest by market cap.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Surprising Predictions from Bloomberg Analyst: "Ethereum ETF Approvals Will Be Nothing Like Bitcoin ETFs" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent interaction with potential spot Ethereum ETF applicant companies represents a significant shift in the outlook for potential approvals.
Next steps include approving forms 19b-4 and S-1 registration statements. Balchunas noted that due to the unique nature of the issue, this may take longer than usual. Once these are met, trading can begin.


“Overcoming the possible approval issue is the most important thing. Now it's all about logistics and legal documents,” he said.
Unlike spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, where the SEC meets with prospective issuers for weeks before finalizing the forms, the SEC began meeting with prospective Ethereum ETF issuers just days before the May 23 deadline for a final decision on the VanEck Ethereum ETF.





Despite the time constraint, Balchunas believes the process should be made easier. “They just completed the Bitcoin process a few months ago, so there will be a lot of copy and paste,” he said.
In the Bitcoin ETF process, issuers like BlackRock have launched spot Bitcoin ETFs with $10 million in seed capital, with billions of dollars of capital reportedly lined up. But Balchunas doubts that will be the case with Ethereum ETFs, in part because the SEC stepped in at the last minute.


“Everyone was pretty optimistic during the Bitcoin ETF process, so they had time. That's not the case right now,” he said. However, he did not rule out that BlackRock could do something quickly.

Balchunas also reiterated his view that Ethereum ETFs may see lower demand than Bitcoin ETFs. “The people who are really interested in this probably already have ETH. And for the casual tourist types, a lot of them are probably happy with Bitcoin. It's what they know best,” he said.





The analyst estimates that Ethereum ETFs could receive 10 to 15% of the assets that their Bitcoin counterparts receive, which would bring the ETFs to around $5 billion to $8 billion. “For any normal launch in the first few years, that's pretty good,” he concluded.

Pro-Crypto Bills Vote: House Democrat Leaders Say "No Whip"


								Recent reports revealed that Democratic Party leaders have opted not to whip the coming vote on two pro-crypto bills. This seemingly positive development comes alongside the recent 180-degree turn the Biden administration appears to be taking on cryptocurrencies.

House Democrat Representatives Don’t Have To Vote No
According to an email shared by Politico, Democratic Party leaders did not urge its members to vote against two pro-crypto bills expected to be brought up to the House of Representatives floor soon.
The Whip Question revealed that Democratic leaders expect bills H. R. 4763 and H. R. 5403 to come to the floor this week. As a result, they have presented their issues with the bills despite not forcing the House Democrats to vote against them.
Bill H. R. 476, or Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, would provide a new regulatory framework for the industry. If passed, FIT21 would establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator of cryptocurrencies and clarify whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity.
Per the email, Democrat leaders consider that the bill includes language that “undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market.”
FIT21 would allegedly also provide a “safe harbor” for entities that would “shield them from SEC rules and regulations until SEC and CFTC finalize their rules,” effectively “weakening” investors’ protections against fraud and market manipulation.
Regarding the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, or bill H.R. 5403, the Democratic Party considers that it would “have broad negative consequences.” The impact includes “hampering the primacy of the U.S. dollar,” and undermining “the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy.”
Due to this, Ranking Members Maxine Waters and David Scott strongly oppose the legislation, releasing a “Dear Colleague” letter on FIT21 specifically and urging Democrat House Representatives to vote “no.”
It’s worth noting that the American Bankers Association (ABA) urged House Representatives to back up bill H.R. 5403. On Monday, ABA published a letter supporting the bill.
The association believes a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is unnecessary and “would present unacceptable risks and costs to the financial system.” Additionally, ABA argues that it would fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve, undermining “the important role banks play in financial intermediation.”
Politico journalist Eleanor Mueller revealed that the floor debate and passage of the bills are allegedly set for Wednesday, May 22.
Is The US Gov’t Shifting On Crypto Regulations?
The US government’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies has created an unclear and uncertain landscape for the crypto industry. Moreover, the strict and sometimes “overreaching” approach against the sector has been strongly criticized by important figures in the community and politicians.
Government scrutiny intensifies as the November elections approach. This has seemingly prompted Biden’s administration to pivot to a more strategic approach to crypto.
As reported by Bitcoinist, experts consider this change could be a response to Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrencies. The Republican candidate and former president has received a positive response from the crypto community for supporting digital assets.
Moreover, the pressure from the community and key political figures, who have asked for clearer regulations and a more welcoming landscape, has put the US government “on the defensive,” as Riot Platform’s Director of Public Policy Sam Lyman highlighted.
Ultimately, the industry’s efforts should continue despite the recent victories. CoinRoutes Chair Dave Weisberger said, “It is NOT time to be complacent.”

Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here's Why


																An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by.
Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally.
The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices.

	Related Reading



Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead.
The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero.
Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset.

As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead.
In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then.
Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run.
It looks like the value of the metric is making a break into the positive territory | Source: @woonomic on X
Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.”

As for how things could play out next, the analyst says,
Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates.
Woo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture.

BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered above $71,000 earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then, as it’s now back below $70,000.

PEPE: 97.3% holders now 'in the money' - Should you remain bullish? - AMBCrypto



PEPE’s Open Interest surged to a new high.
The meme coin’s high MVRV ratio put it at risk of decline.

Pepe’s [PEPE] Futures Open Interest has rallied to a two-month-high amid the recent rally in the cryptocurrency market, according to Coinglass’ data.
Source: Coinglass
At $121 million at press time, the meme coin’s Futures Open Interest surged by 14% in the past 24 hours. 
PEPE Futures Open Interest tracks the total number of outstanding futures contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. 
When it rises, it signals a spike in market activity or a positive change in sentiment among traders, suggesting that more market participants are opening new positions.
Assessing the token’s Funding Rates confirmed the current bullish trend. PEPE’s funding rate was positive at 0.0156% as of this writing. 
Perpetual futures contracts use Funding Rates to ensure that the contract price stays close to the spot price. 
When an asset’s futures funding rates return a positive value, it suggests a strong demand for long positions. It is a bullish signal and interpreted as a precursor to the asset’s continued price growth.
PEPE holders book profit
AMBCrypto assessed how profitable PEPE transactions have been recently and found that its traders have mostly logged gains on their investments. 
A look at the daily ratio of PEPE’s transaction volume in profit to loss (using a 30-day moving average) showed its value at 1.54, according to Santiment’s data.
This revealed that for every PEPE transaction that has ended in a loss in the last month, 1.54 transactions have turned a profit. 
Source: Santiment
According to IntoTheBlock, at press time, 229,120 wallet addresses, which make up 97.30% of all PEPE holders, were “in the money.”  An address is “in the money” when it holds its coins at a profit.
Conversely, only 6,330 addresses, which make up 3% of all PEPE holders, were held at a loss. These addresses bought the meme coin when it traded above $0.000012. 
As of this writing, PEPE exchanged hands at $0.000011, according to CoinMarketCap’s data.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Despite the token’s double-digit rally in the past 24 hours, investors should exercise caution. Per its Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio, PEPE was overvalued at press time.
This metric tracks the ratio between PEPE’s current market price and the average price of each of its acquired tokens. 
When it returns a value above one, it suggests that an asset’s market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings. When this happens, the asset is overvalued. 

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

PEPE’s MVRV ratios assessed on 30-day and 365-day moving averages were 19.08% and 174.94%, respectively.

Historically, high MVRV levels have sometimes been followed by periods of profit-taking, where investors who bought at lower prices sell their holdings.

Billionaire CEO Mike Novogratz Speaks Out: Why Did the SEC Change Its Mind? How Will Prices Be Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi

There is said to be a significant change in the Democratic Party's stance on cryptocurrency, especially Ethereum ETFs. According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, this change has completely turned the Ethereum ETF world upside down.
“I feel like someone from the Biden White House called and said, 'Guys, we can't be the anti-crypto side anymore,'” Novogratz told CNBC. said. This announcement comes after months of silence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is now frantically communicating with potential ETF issuers, including Galaxy Digital, to get the products ready before a key May 23 deadline.


Rumors of this step back have already had a significant impact on the market, with Ethereum rising 20% since the news first emerged. Novogratz believes that if the SEC's change of heart is politically motivated, “this is a seismic shift” and “prices will be much higher from here.”
While prominent members of the Democratic Party, particularly Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have long criticized crypto, Republicans are generally more sympathetic to the sector. The difference in approach has become particularly evident in the past few weeks, with former President Donald Trump, who has historically been skeptical of cryptocurrency, recently stated that he would support the industry if re-elected.





In response, President Joe Biden threatened to veto a proposal to repeal SAB 121, a controversial crypto finance rule, despite bipartisan support. Less than six months before they face each other in the US presidential election, the standoff between the two politicians has “created a ring of fire”, according to Novogratz.
With Trump leading Biden in the polls and crypto companies raising over $150 million to support pro-industry candidates, sometimes in swing states, Novogratz said Democrats' aversion to crypto is becoming less and less plausible.



“It was Elizabeth Warren and a small group of people who literally took the Democrats hostage on this issue,” said Novogratz, adding that Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who voted for the repeal of SAB 121, probably told Warren “enough, this is getting stupid.” he added.
“There is no reason to make crypto, a technology, a political issue,” Novogratz added.

                        In a major development in the crypto space, blockchain investigator ZachXBT identified seven wallet addresses on May 21 containing 891.13 Bitcoin, worth approximately $61 million, linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group Lazarus.ZachXBT shared these findings on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the ongoing threat posed by the state-backed hacker group. The revelation follows the investigator’s previous research, which led to the authorities freezing $3.8 million in digital assets.ZachXBT identifies Seven More Addresses Linked to Lazarus 
As of the latest updates, the flagged wallets still hold the amounts identified by ZachXBT. The usernames “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470” were noted explicitly for their deposits and trading volumes, which matched the stolen funds. The stolen assets were often exchanged into Tether (USDT) before being converted to fiat and withdrawn.Lazarus Group, known for its cyber heists, resurfaced earlier this year after a period of inactivity. On January 8, they moved $1.2 million in stolen digital assets from a mixer to an inactive wallet, involving two transfers totaling 27.37 Bitcoin. Subsequently, 3.343 BTC worth $150,582 was sent to a previously used address. The group also employed social engineering tactics, using LinkedIn to target vulnerable users with malware attacks. Blockchain security firm Slowmist flagged these attacks, noting that the hackers pretended to apply for blockchain developer jobs to gain access to confidential employee credentials.Over $200 Million Laundered By North Korean Hacking Group Lazarus
The discovery of seven more addresses comes after an in-depth analysis published by ZachXBT on April 29, detailing how Lazarus laundered $200 million from over 25 hacks since 2020. The investigation revealed that the group orchestrated over 25 exploits across various blockchains, using crypto-mixing services and peer-to-peer marketplaces to obscure the origins of the stolen funds. The Lazarus Group, infamous for its hacking activities since 2009, reportedly stole over $3 billion in crypto assets over the six years leading up to 2023, directly and indirectly impacting thousands of individuals. The laundered funds were primarily converted into USDT stablecoin before being exchanged for fiat currencies, often through over-the-counter traders in China. Notably, $44 million of the stolen cryptocurrency was laundered through Paxful and Noones P2P marketplaces using specific usernames. In response, Tether blacklisted over $374,000 worth of stolen funds linked to the group, and other stablecoin issuers blacklisted an additional $3.4 million.The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and DeFiLlama data indicate North Korea has been involved in $2.4 billion worth of crypto heists since 2020, with a significant portion attributed to compromised private keys.Despite the increased hacking activity by North Korean groups in 2023, they stole $700 million less than in 2022. The reduction in losses might reflect improved project security and market conditions. Experts warn that hacking activity could surge again with favorable market conditions and the continued expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, however.

Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Warns Against Rushing Into ‘Very Risky’ Superintelligent AI - Decrypt

Vitalik Buterin, the mastermind behind Ethereum, called for a more cautious approach to AI research, calling the current forward frenzy "very risky." Responding to a critique of OpenAI and its leadership by Ryan Selkis—CEO of crypto intelligence firm Messari—the creator of the world's second most influential blockchain outlined his views on AI alignment—the core principles that should drive development."Superintelligent AI is very risky, and we should not rush into it, and we should push against people who try,” Buterin asserted. “No $7 trillion server farms, please.”Superintelligent AI is a theoretical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence in virtually all domains. While many see artificial general intelligence (AGI) as the final realization of the emerging technology's full potential, superintelligent models would be what comes next. While today’s state-of-the-art AI systems have not yet reached these thresholds, advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI-related technologies continue to progress—and people are by turns excited and worried.After Messari tweeted that "AGI is too important for us to deify another smooth-talking narcissist,” Buterin emphasized the importance of a diverse AI ecosystem to avoid a world where the immense value of AI is owned and controlled by very few people.“A strong ecosystem of open models running on consumer hardware [is] an important hedge to protect against a future where value captured by AI is hyper-concentrated and most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people,” he said. “Such models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries."The Ethereum creator has been closely following the AI scene, recently praising the open-source LLM Llama3 model. He also suggested that OpenAI’s GPT-4o multimodal LLM could have passed the Turing test after a study argued that human responses were indistinguishable from those generated by the AI.Buterin also addressed the categorization of AI models into "small" and "large" groups, with the focus on regulation of "large" models being a reasonable priority. However, he expressed concern that many current proposals could result in everything being classified as "large" over time.Buterin's remarks come amid heated debates surrounding AI alignment and the resignations of key figures in OpenAI's super alignment research team. Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike have left the company, with Leike accusing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman of prioritizing "shiny products'' over responsible AI development.It was separately revealed that OpenAI has stringent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevent its employees from discussing the company after their departure.High-level, long-view debates about super intelligent are turning more urgent, with experts expressing concern while making widely varying recommendations.Paul Christiano, who formerly led the language model alignment team at OpenAI, has established the Alignment Research Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to aligning AI and machine learning systems with "human interests." As reported by Decrypt, Christiano suggested that there could be a "50/50 chance of catastrophe shortly after we have systems at the human level."On the other hand, Yann LeCun, Meta's chief researcher, believes that such a catastrophic scenario is highly unlikely. Back in April 2023, he stated in a tweet, that the "hard take-off" scenario is "utterly impossible." LeCun asserted that short-term AI developments significantly influence the way AI evolves, shaping its long-term trajectory.Buterin, instead, thinks of himself as a centrist. In an essay from 2023 —which he ratified today— he recognized that "it seems very hard to have a "friendly" superintelligent-AI-dominated world where humans are anything other than pets," but also argued that "often, it really is the case that version N of our civilization's technology causes a problem, and version N+1 fixes it. However, this does not happen automatically, and requires intentional human effort." In other words, if superintelligence becomse an issue, humans would probably find a way to deal with that.The departure of OpenAI's more cautious alignment researchers and the company’s shifting approach to safety policies have raised broader, mainstream concerns about the lack of attention to ethical AI development among major AI startups. Indeed, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have also reportedly disbanded their teams responsible for ensuring that AI is being safely developed.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Why Did the SEC Suddenly Change Its Mind on Ethereum ETFs? An Inside Source Reveals the Real Reason - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly on the verge of approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This sudden change left companies trying to understand the SEC's change of attitude in a difficult situation.
Just two weeks ago, the SEC showed no interest in the filings, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, on Monday, the SEC's trading and markets division notified exchanges that they would approve 19b-4s this week. This news coincides with reports from Barrons' SEC staff indicating a trend toward approval.


The source described the situation as “completely unprecedented” and suggested that this U-turn was “purely political”. This speculation stems from a lack of internal coordination within the SEC. While the trading and markets division is preparing to approve 19b-4s, the corporate finance division, which is responsible for S-1s, appears out of sync on this issue.

The source also speculated that the SEC's change of heart could be politically motivated, given the fast-approaching elections. Former President Donald Trump, who recently backed crypto, told a crowd of NFT buyers, “If you love cryptocurrencies in any form, you better vote for Trump.”





The source believes this could become a campaign issue, especially since Democrats desperately need the youth vote. The source suggested that President Joe Biden could score a win with the approval of spot ETH ETFs and position himself as a leader going forward.
The next step involves updating the 19b-4 forms once comments are received from the SEC. Given the tight deadlines, comments on 19b-4s are expected to be light. The source emphasized the urgency of the situation, likening the SEC's efforts to “writing a term paper the night before the deadline.”

Fed, Bank of Japan Will Drive Bitcoin to $1 Million, Says Arthur Hayes - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Federal Reserve and Bank Of Japan will be key drivers of a Bitcoin price rally to $1 million, predicts BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, when both the central banks hit “the easy button” to rescue the Asian nation’s flagging currency.Hayes argued in an essay published on Monday that the dollar-yen exchange rate is “the most important global economic variable” right now, due to its potential to influence central bankers into ballooning the global money supply.He says the story, however, begins in China, which has the most to lose from the yen’s ongoing devaluation trend.“If the CNYJPY exchange rate rises (weaker JPY vs. stronger CNY), China’s export competitiveness is hurt,” Hayes wrote. “If the yen keeps weakening, China will respond by devaluing the yuan.”Since a country’s local goods are denominated in its local currency, a fast-inflating currency is good for countries that rely on exports to keep their economy moving.Unfortunately for China, Japan is its biggest competitor in the automotive export market, and as the yen becomes increasingly cheap, Japan is difficult to compete with on prices.Hayes expects the Bank of China to pressure the United States into making Japan strengthen the yen. Even so, he writes that the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) will have trouble strengthening its currency through traditional methods like raising interest rates.“The BOJ would meltdown faster than Sam Bankman-Fried on a witness stand if they were to raise rates,” Hayes wrote, explaining that doing so would crater the value of Japanese government bonds which are 50% owned by the central bank itself.To keep bonds from collapsing, the BOJ would have to force local banks and pension funds to buy the government’s debt, Hayes said. Funding that purchase would require selling US Treasuries and US stocks, however—which would run against American interests.Hayes concludes that instead of raising rates, the BOJ must resort to “the easy button”: the unlimited US dollar “swap line” where the BOJ and Federal Reserve can swap yen for dollars at a specified rate.Since the BOJ can freely print more yen, their cost of gaining more dollars is effectively zero. Those dollars may then be used to buy up the yen, strengthening Japan’s currency while simultaneously weakening the dollar.The final scenario would be a win for all parties: China maintains a weaker currency than Japan, the BOJ stays solvent, and the dollar weakens because of the BOJ’s open-market yen purchases.It’s also good for crypto since environments with lots of money printing tend to drive up Bitcoin’s price alongside other assets, Hayes argued.“When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond,” the investor wrote.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

zkSync Could Launch Token This Week - The Defiant

The Ethereum Layer 2 network’s long-awaited airdrop is expected in mid-June.zkSync, an Ethereum Layer 2 network powered by zero-knowledge technology, is planning to conduct its Token Generation Event (TGE) this week, according to a report from The Block.While the ticker is yet to be announced, the token is expected to have a maximum supply of 21 billion, with an airdrop for early adopters to take place within 30 days of the TGE, the report claims.zkSync Era is a top 10 Layer 2 with $927 million in total value locked (TVL).zkSync Era TVLDeFi traders have been speculating on a potential airdrop ever since Era went live in March 2023. Last week, the project finally confirmed that a token would be forthcoming, posting that it “stands by its commitment to decentralize.”More than three million wallets have generated 8.1 million transactions on the network to date, according to a Dune dashboard.Daily TransactionsHowever, activity peaked shortly after Era launched and has trended lower ever since.

$300,000 Withdrawal at JPMorgan Chase Instantly Stolen at Bank Branch in Brooklyn: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A JPMorgan Chase customer reportedly lost $300,000 at a bank branch in Brooklyn immediately after withdrawing the cash.
The 31 year-old customer withdrew the huge sum from a teller and was robbed once he exited the bank’s front door, reports News 12.










Although the bank has not released a statement on the assault, it provided security footage from the branch showing the alleged robber, which authorities have now made public.
Source: NYPD / Crime Stoppers
Police say the suspect “forcibly removed” the cash from the customer and rode away on a scooter.
Chase has not said whether it will reimburse the victim and the customer has not made any public statements on the incident, which happened last month.
The New York Police Department is asking anyone with information on what happened to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.
Last year, Chase made headlines over new safety measures in New York City.
Amid a surge in crime, the banking giant said a “small number” of its ATMs in NYC would be switched off by 6:00 p.m. “due to rising crime and vagrancy that occurred in these previously 24/7 vestibules.”

Galaxy Digital Exec: This Is How the SEC Could Classify ETH as Security


																Alex Thorn, the Head of Research at Galaxy Research, speculated that the SEC could differentiate between Ethereum (ETH) and staked Ether, possibly classifying the latter as a security.
He noted that this distinction could provide a regulatory loophole for approving spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Loophole
In a May 21 post on X, he stated, “If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between ‘ETH’ NOT being a security and ‘staked ETH’ (or even more flimsily, ‘staking as a service ETH’) as BEING a security.”


This potential distinction could have implications for spot Ethereum ETFs, which the SEC has been reluctant to approve so far. According to Thorn, this shift would align with the SEC’s ongoing legal battles and investigations, enabling it to approve spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining consistency with its previous arguments and positions.




However, Thorn also highlights that this approach might involve specific restrictions on spot Ethereum ETFs. He suggested that the SEC might prohibit ETFs from staking the ETH they hold.
By distinguishing between ETH and staked ETH, the SEC could allow for the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs while maintaining a strict regulatory framework around staked assets and other altcoins.
SEC Approval Optimism
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their predicted likelihood of a spot Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75% on Monday. This change followed discussions suggesting that the SEC might adopt a more favorable stance towards these applications.


In a May 20 post on X, Balchunas hinted that the SEC’s increased pace toward approving the ETF could be influenced by political pressure, contrasting with the agency’s previous lack of engagement with ETF applicants.
The analysts later clarified that their increased odds only apply to 19b-4 approvals, with the SEC’s decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF anticipated on May 23. “We also need S-1 approvals. It could be weeks to months before we see S-1 approvals and thus a live Eth ETF,” Seyffart explained.
He added, “That said, if we’re correct and we see these theoretical approvals later this week, it *should* mean that S-1 approvals are a matter of ‘when’ not ‘if.'”
Meanwhile, Ethereum’s value has surged by over 20% following news that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs, despite the market’s earlier consensus that approval was unlikely.

Trump campaign begins accepting bitcoin, ether and other crypto donations - Blockworks


Former President Donald J. Trump’s website says that the presidential candidate now supports crypto donations. 
According to his campaign website, users can donate fiat or, selecting more options, donate crypto. His campaign supports donations made via Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask, and the donations are made to joint fundraising committees organized by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNCH).
“Demonstrating President Trump’s success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency,” the site said.

The site shows the logos for bitcoin, Ripple’s XRP, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solaba, SHIB and Cardano. 
Trump promised to allow crypto donations in a speech made earlier this month, which highlighted crypto as a political issue in this year’s presidential race. 
“This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations,” a statement about the move said.
It added that Trump plans to “build a crypto army” ahead of the Nov. 5 election by allowing supporters to donate crypto.

The former president is not the only candidate in this presidential race to offer people the chance to donate their crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign announced that it would accept bitcoin last May. 
But the opportunity for politicians to collect donations in more than just cash can be traced back to 2016, when Senator Rand Paul sought bitcoin donations during that year’s presidential election. 
Presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Eric Salwell also accepted crypto donations back in 2020.

Farcaster Raises $150M Series A from Paradigm | Bankless


Farcaster, the leading decentralized social network, has raised $150 million in a Series A round led by Paradigm, with participation from a16z crypto, USV, Variant, and more.What's the scoop?The latest funding round values Farcaster at $1 billion and comes as the network has facilitated 350K paid signups and an exponential increase in activity since going permissionless in October 2023. While the Farcaster team still has most of its funds from its May 2022 seed fundraise, the new windfall will allow them to further hone in on growing daily active users and adding new in-protocol primitives like channels and direct messaging."We’re doubling down on Farcaster to grow it to an internet-scale protocol,” Dan Romero, Farcaster cofounder, said on the news. “This funding will support our work for many years to come."Bankless take:Farcaster is king of the hill in the crypto social scene right now, so this new raise positions the team well to extend their dominance that much further. The protocol already has a significant swath of developers building atop it, so more money for building new dev-friendly features will undoubtedly lead to new waves of apps and users.Zooming out, this Series A is a big bet on the continued success of Farcaster, and if the protocol does in fact keep gaining traction from here, its rise will signal a shift toward more user-centric and decentralized internet experiences, challenging the status quo of traditional social networks.

ETH NFTs in the Banana Zone | Bankless


Last month, Real Vision cofounder and CEO Raoul Pal said crypto seemed to be on the verge of the banana zone, where majors and altcoins rally hard as new all-time highs (ATHs) are reached. That prospect of the, ahem, banana zone came further into focus this week as the ETH price surged to +$3,700 on the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems prepared to approve its first ETH ETFs. With ETH now within 24% of its previous record of $4,878, and having seen $75B in inflows yesterday on the ETF excitement alone, it’s no stretch to assume that an official ETF approval in the coming days could rocket ETH through its previous ATH and into price discovery mode. Why? As DCinvestor recently pointed out, a supply-side crisis seems brewing around ETH. Imagine the buy pressure of major Wall Street inflows, which could be considerable, to say the least.Then imagine that pressure against how Ethereum only issues ~2.5k ETH per day currently, and at times that issuance can be entirely offset by fee burns, and how there is a ton of ETH essentially locked away in staking and across various apps and Layer 2s (L2s) right now. via XThese factors create a perfect storm for a dramatic supply shock. As more institutional investors and retail buyers rush to gain exposure to ETH, the limited circulating supply would seemingly struggle to meet this demand. This dynamic could propel ETH into uncharted territory, driving prices far beyond previous ATHs. For those of us that stack ETH, that would be great—bring on the banana zone squared. But what else should we be looking out for?For his part, the banana king himself, Raoul Pal, thinks the next NFT bull run will rev up once ETH breaches through its previous ATH.via XPersonally, I agree, as we’ve seen this play out before. When ETH rallied hard in 2021, people also rallied hard into things you could do with your ETH, like NFTs. That said, if ETH really does take off in the weeks to come, then it’s not out of the question for the floor prices of, say, the top ETH NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, and Miladies to double or beyond by summer’s end. You would also undoubtedly see a resurgence around NFT apps like NFTfi platforms if that happened. via CoinGeckoOf course, I thought Runes would catalyze the Ordinals ecosystem, and while there are surely still synergies to come here, that catalyzing hasn’t panned out yet. And to be sure, I do think it’s always good to anticipate the unexpected. Maybe the arrival of ETH ETFs won’t be a huge catalyst for the ETH NFT scene. Yet the arrival of Runes and the arrival of ETH ETFs are very different beasts. Runes didn’t kick off the next leg up in the crypto bull market, but ETH ETFs seem primed to do just that. And the potential ETH supply-side crisis has no analogue with Runes. If the ETH price does rocket to new heights, holders will feel more risk-on, and a non-trivial number of them will bid on NFTs they’ve been eyeing over the past bear market. Plus, NFT projects of all stripes have better UX than they did just a few years ago, so the ecosystem is more fertile now. Another angle to consider is that a new bullish momentum in ETH and ETH NFTs would likely spur a new wave of innovation and experimentation within the NFT space, from crosschain experiences to games and beyond.All in all, then? We may be on the verge of the next transformative period in crypto where NFTs and their use cases surge anew. Stay vigilant, and brace yourself, because things may go bananas soon…

Ethereum's Time | Bankless


Impending Approval? Denial of spot ETH ETFs was certain to occur at the outset of the week, but from the depths of multi-year lows on the ETH/BTC ratio echoed a “we’re so back” that has radically shifted the prevailing perception. Why are markets now anticipating approval, and have we already priced in the immediate upside?Bloomberg’s ETF analysts increased their odds of spot ETH ETF approval threefold to 75% yesterday afternoon after hearing information that the SEC may have reversed its looming decision to deny the applications because crypto has increasingly become an election issue.News that the SEC had asked exchanges SEC to update their 19b-4 filings for spot ETH ETFs on “an accelerated basis” broke shortly after Bloomberg updated its approval odds; this request likely would not have been made if denial was certain.
Despite the increasing pervasiveness of expert-driven negative approval sentiment throughout 2024, the eventual listing of spot ETH ETFs had already guaranteed by the approval of commodity futures-based ETH ETFs as of last October.While these experts had extolled that a lack of meaningful communication between the SEC and proposed issuers was proof of denial, it looks increasingly probable that the same level of communication required to approve spot BTC ETFs was unnecessary to approve spot ETH ETFs. In the final months leading up to spot BTC ETF approval, issuers were consulted by the SEC about proposed creation and redemption processes, the roles of authorized participants, and matters related to custody.
Crucially, the approval of futures-based ETH ETF had occurred after Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, nullifying concerns that staking could result in Ether’s classification as a digital asset security.With the experts close to confident on approval and Polymarket’s prediction odds now at 66% – the highest level since early January – consensus is forming that ETH ETF approval is certain to occur this Thursday, leaving those who had prepared for denial caught offsides by a monstrous pump for Ether!
ETH gained nearly $600 in dollar-denominated terms yesterday, its largest single-day gain in price corresponding to a market capitalization increase nearly the size of Solana's total MC, meanwhile the ETH/BTC ratio rallied 20% on the heightened odds of spot ETF approval and regained key support at 0.05 after plunging to new multi-year lows last week.In just under a day, erratic crypto traders went from heavily underweight Ether to trampling over each other for ETH longs, and although we can now anticipate the approval of spot ETH ETF products with confidence, questions remain over whether it will be a bullish catalyst for markets.BTC price fell by 20% in the twelve days following its spot ETF debut, with hefty redemptions on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) suppressing any net flows that could be generated from alternative products until the end of January; Ethereum faces a similar situation, with over $10B in ETH set to become redeemable upon the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.Although regulatory filings have revealed a smattering of BTC ETF holdings among institutions, the majority of shares are held by investment advisors on behalf of their retail clients who can easily access crypto through alternative routes and hedge funds that are unlikely to be assuming directional exposure to BTC price.The arrival of Ethereum's spot ETFs is theoretically bullish, but only if they result in net inflows from buyers who are not hedging against price risks (i.e.; hedge funds).Traditional market participants have demonstrated interest in purchasing Ethereum, attested to by the $100M they have put into ETH futures products, but it's unclear if initial inflows will be powerful enough to counteract Grayscale outflows.

Crypto Exchange Binance Discloses Investment in L2 DEX Protocol Aevo - The Daily Hodl


								The venture capital arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume is announcing a new investment in a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol.
According to a new press release, Binance Labs has invested in a layer-2 (L2) DEX called Aevo, a rebrand of Ribbon Finance.










Aevo bills itself as a high-performance derivatives DEX platform tailored for futures and perpetual contracts trading.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is built on top of the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 protocol Optimism’s (OP) OP Stack. It acts as an off-chain order book, with orders settled on-chain on Ethereum. The protocol uses Celestia (TIA) as a high-throughput data availability (DA) layer to increase scalability. The project is also backed by Paradigm, Dragonfly and Coinbase Ventures.
According to the announcement, Aevo plans to use the investment to grow the ecosystem and its community, which already has over 50,000 monthly active users who have done more than $80 billion in derivatives volume.
“As part of the future roadmap, Aevo will launch vault strategies, yield products, and Aevo staking. It will expand its ecosystem of derivative products by allowing builders to deploy their dApps permissionlessly on Aevo L2 to leverage its growing user base and unique features.”
Binance Labs is the accelerator and venture capital arm of Binance.

Venture Capitalist Rips Into Cardano, Questions Network's Decentralization Claims


								Justin Bons, the founder of Cyber Capital, has launched a scathing attack on Cardano, claiming that the Ethereum competitor is “centralized.” Venture capitalists are convinced that this level of centralization, at the protocol level, is a “major weakness of the proof-of-chain blockchain.”
Founder: Cardano Is Centralized
According to Bons’ assessment, there is a problem with Cardano’s “genesis keys.” Technically, these keys are a multi-signature system that grants control over core protocol rules. 
In a post on X, the VC argued that these keys confer “excessive power” to Input Output Global (IOG), the company developing the smart contract platform.

The Genesis keys were introduced during the third phase of Cardano’s development: Shelley. The problem is that these “keys were not a temporary measure but released as part of the network’s design.” As earlier designed, the IOG didn’t have the absolute power of the genesis keys. 
However, the Cardano Foundation’s decision to delegate its control to the developer meant that IOG was now in control.
Cardano price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: ADAUSDT on Binance, TradingView
The alleged centralization, Bons claim, is that IOG “controls five out of the seven genesis keys.” With this, the developer can unilaterally alter the protocol without community consensus. This level of control, the founder adds, “goes against Cardano’s claims that the platform is one of the highly decentralized, even better than Ethereum.”
That IOG has this power, Bons continued, means “they can exploit these keys and even disrupt the network.” For instance, the developer can stop the blockchain from processing blocks or modify how ADA is distributed to validators. 
The Venture Capital founder claims that the centralization of Genesis keys can be seen in the deliberately slow development approach. Unlike competitors like Solana, Cardano is still being refined, with IOG planning to enhance efficiency once Voltaire goes live.
Cardano roadmap | Source: Cardano
Will Voltaire Increase Decentralization Levels?
By design, public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, for example, are decentralized. Though the level of decentralization varies as they evolve, validators are guaranteed not to censor transactions or reverse some, even in extreme disruptive hacks. 
The censorship resistance feature gives these ledgers an edge over centralized options, explaining the rapidly increasing adoption across the board.

How IOG and the Cardano community will resolve this remains to be seen. In the next development phase, Voltaire, the network will introduce on-chain governance. With this, the use of Genesis keys will be a thing of the past.

Bits + Bips: Is US Politics Driving the ETH ETF Approval? - Unchained


                                Why ETH spot ETFs are now more likely—and the reversal may have come from the Biden administration. Will this lead to ETH reaching all-time highs, sway US elections, or spark a new wave of crypto spot ETFs?

RFK Jr. Says He Bought GameStop to ‘Punish Predator Short Selling to the Moon’ - Decrypt

As crypto policy increasingly divides political parties, U.S. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—better known as RFK—is now touting his love for meme stocks.In a Wednesday Twitter post, the independent candidate said that he had bought $24,000 in GameStop stock as a way to “punish predatory short selling.” GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a video game retailer which first made headlines in 2021 when amateur traders started buying its stock and pumping its price. It made a comeback last week after the trader that started the 2021 buying frenzy, known as Roaring Kitty, posted online for the first time in nearly three years. “We need a free and fair market,” RFK tweeted. “Let’s punish predatory short-selling to the moon. By the way, I ride with you and I’m not leaving.”He added: “My administration will support the Ape retail rebellion and enact aggressive Wall Street reforms.”RFK was referring to the Wall Street firms that had initially shorted GameStop stock, betting that its price would go down. The 2021 trading frenzy aimed to stymie this strategy, and promote investing among ordinary citizens. Roaring Kitty—real name Keith Gill—urged people to invest. The craze eventually led to Wall Street chaos due to shares suddenly going up in value. Despite this, it has since been revealed that major Wall Street firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard held GameStop shares and may have raked in billions of dollars as a result. Such investments are now known as meme stocks—shares of companies made popular on Internet forums. Meme stocks later led to a surge in popularity in cryptocurrencies known as meme coins.Both meme coins and stocks shot up in value last week following Roaring Kitty’s return, with some investors making huge gains. Crypto has becoming an increasingly pivotal issue in politics, with Trump stepping up his courtship of cryptocurrency holders and U.S. President Joe Biden finding himself at odds with some in his own party over federal regulation of the space.RFK is not a newcomer to the space, and aligned himself with the digital asset industry in the past. He previously said he wants the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills to be backed by Bitcoin, and vowed to put the U.S. budget on the blockchain if elected.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        Former U.S. Treasury official Graham Steele is receiving backlash after he took to X Monday morning to scrutinize support for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) ahead of its likely vote on Wednesday.Steele’s X post came in response to a social media petition created by Digital Innovation For America (DIFA) supporting the bill, claiming that “the best way to fight Big Tech is with Blockchain technology.”X Users React After Graham Steele Shares Stance On DIFA FIT21 Petition
Calling the written request “pretty sneaky,” Steele noted that the highly-anticipated crypto bill does not include a prohibition on “Big Tech.”“This petition about the FIT 21 Act uses progressive framing, claiming that the bill fights against “‘Big Tech,’” Steele said. “FIT 21 actually creates a light-touch regulatory framework for crypto, largely outside securities laws.“Consisting of organizations such as Amazon, Apple, and Meta, some members of the crypto community feel that standard “Big Tech” companies’ top-down structure may at times stand in stark contrast to blockchain’s traditionally decentralized nature, seemingly prompting social media backlash to Steele’s take on DIFA’s petition.“Poor take,” one X user replied. “Educate yourself about the tech and what is happening here.”“I would argue this is fighting back against big tech,” another alleged. “Blockchain networks are better for consumers than corporate networks.”“You are making this a partisan issue and alienating millions of young, enthusiastic voters who want freedom to innovate,” a third claimed. “Decentralized crypto threatens ‘Big Tech’ – they are fighting against it! We hoped you would be different.”Martin Gruenberg’s Replacement And A House Vote On FIT21
Steele’s post came amid a turbulent 24 hours for the FDIC, with Chair Gruenberg announcing he would resign from his position in light of sexual harassment, discrimination, and general misconduct concerns.In a statement on Monday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michael claimed Biden would announce Gruenberg’s replacement “soon,” with recent reports suggesting that Steele may make the cut to take over the position.The federal corporation has previously warned about the potential risks associated with crypto-assets pertaining to banking organizations.Meanwhile, the House is gearing up for a full floor vote on FIT21, which is scheduled for Wednesday.Backed by several key industry leaders in the crypto space, a successful vote on the bill could prove critical in establishing a robust regulatory framework with increased freedom for digital asset operators across the United States.

Donald Trump now accepts Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and other cryptos for his election campaign

Photo: Michael M. Santiago (Reuters)The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, announced late Tuesday afternoon that he would accept donations in Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies. With this move, he has become the first major party candidate to embrace digital currencies. Earlier this month, the former president declared himself as the candidate for cryptocurrency at a Mar-a-Lago gala, propelling crypto into the 2024 campaign.Why Bitcoin and Ether are skyrocketingCryptocurrency donations will be accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product. “MAGA [Make America Great Again] supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th,” per the statement.Trump’s recent stance on cryptocurrency is viewed as an attack on Democrats, who have historically been unsupportive of cryptocurrency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in particular, campaigned against cryptocurrency. However, this year, even some Democrats are pro-cryptocurrency, distancing themselves from Warren’s stance.Crypto has emerged as a political topic in this election year, with presidential candidate Trump making several pro-crypto statements during his campaigns. However, he has not yet declared how he plans to support cryptocurrency and blockchain growth through policies. His position on cryptocurrency represents a significant U-turn. A few years ago, he denounced Bitcoin as “a scam against the U.S. dollar” and said the central bank digital currencies are “very dangerous.” In the past years, he said that crypto is “a disaster waiting to happen” and that he is “not a fan of it.” But now he says he is “good” with it.

Reaction to the announcement was mixed, prompting some security experts to call the feature spyware and a natural target for cybercriminals.“This is the company that wants to record literally everything you ever do on your computer,” Geometric Intelligence founder and CEO Gary Marcus wrote on Twitter. “If you don’t think Microsoft Recall, local or no, will be one of the biggest cyber targets in history, you aren’t paying attention.”“I’m so glad Microsoft is out here helping me recall why I don’t use Windows if I can help it, and when I do, I disable every ‘smart’ feature they add,” writer at Linus Tech Tips Emily Young wrote.“Back in my day, we called this spyware,” Software Engineer and crypto researcher and critic Molly White wrote.With Recall, verything that appears on screen is captured—including passwords, if the app or form doesn't automatically obscure it.Although a simple premise, the implementation of Recall requires a lot of care, cybersecurity expert Katelyn Bowden told Decrypt.“Recall appears to function like existing search engines, with an expanded scope of what it records,” Bowden said, noting that Recall only functions on PCs with specific hardware configurations. “You already have a browser history and file contents index on your PC, and this is functionally no different. And unlike many of those files, Microsoft says Recall data is encrypted.“If Microsoft were to start off-loading processing of the training set, or collecting data for use in recommendation engines or off-machine models, user privacy could be compromised,” she noted.Bowden is a member of the hacker collective known as the Cult of the Dead Cow and also serves as the chief marketing officer at the open-source privacy-focused Veilid Project. She said more transparency around how AI tools are used is essential.“I always feel more comfortable when companies who develop AI products are transparent about what datasets were used to train the software,” Bowden said. “Microsoft’s lack of transparency surrounding that concerns me. If people don’t know what data was used to train the model, they shouldn’t submit to it.”With OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft pushing hard to bring generative AI products to market, several projects and groups are also offering decentralized and open-source alternatives, including Venice AI, FLock, PolkaBot AI, and the Superintelligence Alliance.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote earlier today that open-source AI is the best way to avoid a future where “most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people.”“People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever,” Venice AI founder and CEO Erik Voorhees previously told Decrypt. “The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Dogecoin Forms Bullish Triangle Pattern, Analyst Reveals The Next Target | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin is currently seeing reasonable upside following the Bitcoin recovery above $71,000. This has sent the whole crypto market into a state of euphoria, and the DOGE price has crossed the $0.16 resistance while at it. This bullish trend is expected to continue, as one analyst points out that Dogecoin has formed a bullish triangle pattern.
Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Points To More Upside
In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Lingrid pointed out an interesting formation on the Dogecoin chart. According to the analyst, the meme coin has successfully formed a triangle pattern, which has been historically bullish for the price.

Explaining how this came to be, the crypto analyst explained that the market has been consolidating below the upper border of the triangle. Now, this triangle pattern often leads to a price squeeze, which is very bullish for its price.
Lingrid identified a range zone for Dogecoin just above $0.15, which was important to the formation of the triangle. This is because the appearance of a range zone suggests that accumulation is going on and it is time for the price to begin to move. Sometimes, this can be either bearish or bullish, but as the crypto analyst points out, with the “consolidating just below the upper border of the triangle,” this time around, it is bullish for the price.

Additionally, the meme coin has been creating higher lows, suggesting that this is a sustained bullish trend. “If the price breaks through the downward trendline, we can expect a bullish rally to follow. Furthermore, if the price breaks through the range zone and closes above it, it’s likely that the market will move higher. My target is resistance at 0.17500,” Lingrid states.
DOGE Remains Bullish
This week, the Dogecoin price has turned rather bullish as investor interest has turned toward the meme coin. One way that this is shining through is the trading volume of the digital asset which has jumped more than 130% in the last week. Currently, Coinmarketcap data shows a more than 132% increase in trading volume which has sent it to almost $2 billion at the time of writing.

At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the Dogecoin open interest, suggesting that traders are now betting big on the DOGE price. Coinglass data shows that in the last 24 hours, there is an 18% increase to reach $921.4 million. This is the highest that the open interest has been in the past month and shows a turn in the tide from the bearish trend. Historically, an increase in open interest has usually correlated with an increase in price. So, in this case, it is expected that the price rally will continue.
For now, DOGE bulls continue to dominate the market, pushing it over 8% in the last day. It is currently trading at $0.164, which is a 122% increase in the last year.

Gala Games Recovers $23M Stolen By Hacker, Plans Token Buyback Program


																In a recent security incident, Gala Games, a Web3 gaming company, fell victim to an exploit that led to the unauthorized minting of 5 billion tokens, equivalent to approximately $214 million. 
The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed.
CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach
Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen. 
The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach.

	Related Reading



Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks. 
Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract.
Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected. 
Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence.
Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued.
The incident raised concerns regarding the project’s daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself.
DFW Labs Support
In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit. 
However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.

                        As the Fantom (FTM) price climbs to new monthly highs, investors are asking whether it might be too late to buy Fantom.Last at $0.8744, FTM is up 35% in the past seven days according to CoinMarketCap.A seemingly sudden shift in the SEC’s position on Ethereum ETFs has injected positive momentum into market this week.Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, Ark 21Shares and Franklin all filed amended 19B-4 applications on Tuesday.That comes one day after rumors emerged that the SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs as soon as this week.That helped launch FTM nearly as high as $1.0 on Monday, with the price having since dropped around 5%.While not in as much focus this week, macro is also more of a tailwind these days.US jobs and CPI inflation data this month helped bolster bets for Fed rate cuts this year. Tomorrow’s Fed minutes release shouldn’t threaten that narrative too much.When financial markets move to price in easier financial conditions, this tends to bolster crypto.And high-beta altcoins like Fantom are especially sensitive to changes in financial conditions.Fantom also recently kickstarted an exciting upgrade to integrate its innovative Sonic technology.The outlook in crypto markets seems tilted towards more near-term upside.So is it too late to buy Fantom?Is It Too Late to Buy Fantom?
Well, investors jumping in now will have missed the bottom of the recent price dip by a large margin.But that doesn’t mean its too late to buy Fantom.FTM remains nearly 30% below its 2024 highs. So investors can, at the very least, rest assured that they aren’t buying the market right at its recent peak.Nor is the Fantom price anywhere near its long-term peak.FTM briefly surpassed $3.70 in 2021, so it is still trading at a 75% discount versus its record highs.If FTM can break to the north of its 2021 highs this cycle, investors could still bag 5x gains.In that sense, it definitely isn’t too late to buy Fantom.If Fantom (FTM) can hit new record highs this cycle, then that means it definitely isnt too late to buy Fantom. Source: TradingViewFantom Alternative to Consider – Wiener AI (WAI)
The outlook for Fantom is strong this bull market. The Fantom Foundation is pushing to kickstart a meme season on the blockchain.If successful, this could accelerate FTM’s appreciation, as seen with Solana.But, as noted, FTM’s gains this bull market might be limited to as much as 5x.Those gains are to be sniffed at. But some crypto traders will be targeting much greater upside.Such traders often flock to the meme coin market hunting for gems.One potential meme coin gem that analysts at Cryptonews like a lot is Wiener AI (WAI).The sausage dog-themed coin offers useful AI-powered trading tools and has already raised over $2.5 million in its presale.WAI is not only a meme coin with AI capabilities but also a potential passive income gem.20% of the supply has been allocated to staking rewards, and investors are currently earning a massive 396% APY, as per the project’s official website.At this rate, investors can double their initial presale investment in just a few months.Crypto experts have been lining up to join the Sausage army. Here’s why widely followed crypto analyst Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 312,000 YouTube subscribers, ranks WAI as a top crypto for 2024.VIDEOInterested investors need to move quickly, as the WAI price will rise when the presale hits $2.7 million.At the current price of $0.000709, WAI’s market cap is under $50 million.If it achieves market leadership, early investors stand to benefit greatly, with a potential for 100x gains or more.Buy Wiener AI Here

                        Tuesday, May 21, 2024- As Sealana’s (SEAL) presale passes the $2 million mark, the Solana-based meme coin is poised to become the next crypto to explode in value. Sealana is a playful and culturally resonant meme coin inspired by a patriotic, obese American redneck seal reminiscent of the South Park World of Warcraft character.The Sealana presale operates on a fixed price model, selling tokens at $0.022 each. Investors can purchase $SEAL using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, or with fiat currency using a bank card.Sealana’s quirky concept and its play on American culture has struck a chord with the crypto community, visibly driving interest and investment. The concept is simple yet engaging: feed Sealana SOL (Solana’s native token), fatten him up, and watch as he repays you with SEAL straight into your wallet.After achieving the $2 million-mark milestone, the FOMO for Sealana’s market debut continues to build. The latest Solana meme coin is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum.The success of previous Solana meme coins like Slothana (SLOTH), which, like Sealana, raised $15 million in its send-to-wallet presale in just over four weeks, sets a promising precedent for Sealana.Solana has emerged as a robust platform for meme coins, thanks to its stability, efficiency and low transaction costs.Solana Network Remains Resilient, Sealana Continues the Momentum Solana is up 25.36% over the past week and the viral meme coins on its network have remained resilient. Notable examples include DogWifHat, which is up 28.12% and POPCAT, which increased 9.26% in the last 24 hours.Betting on Solana-based meme coins right now could prove beneficial. SLOTH, which is down by 19% over last week, after launching on the top 10 HTX exchange, could be worth a look too.The cryptocurrency market is expected to experience a summer meme coin frenzy, driven by bullish sentiment following April’s Bitcoin halving.Historically Bitcoin halvings have led to increased interest in the broader crypto market, including meme coins. This anticipated market shift could further boost Sealana’s prospects.Meanwhile, the market is abuzz with speculation that the team behind Sealana may have also been involved with SLERF – another meme coin that recorded an all-time high price of $1.30 in March 2024, but is currently trading at $0.3117. Traders in the SLERF market might now be looking for the next strong Solana meme coin, like Sealana.VIDEOSealana Presale: A Safe Bet For Q2 2024? Since March 12, Solana has consistently outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it an attractive option for meme coin projects. The growth is supported by technological advancements such as token extensions, which enhance the functionality and utility of SPL tokens.The broader Solana system continues to experience rapid growth, with significant increases in DEX trading volumes and project funding.Sealana represents the next wave of Solana-based meme coins, blending cultural resonance with innovative blockchain technology.Investors looking for the next big thing in crypto should keep a close eye on Sealana.Follow the latest developments on Sealana’s X account and Telegram channel.Don’t miss your chance to purchase Sealana at what could be its lowest price ever. You can buy Sealana today at the official website.

âItâs happeningâ: Ethereum ETF approval is imminent as issuers amend 19b-4 filings - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on X that the movement to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US “is happening.” According to Seyffart, at least five of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers have submitted their Amended 19b-4s in a 25-minute timespan.“Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE,” he added. The 19b-4 Form is one of the mandatory documents that need to be filed before the SEC can approve an ETF.However, even with the spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the US, Seyffart highlights that this doesn’t mean an immediate launch. Notably, it can take up to months after the approval of Ethereum ETFs before they can be officially traded.“But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,” added the Bloomberg analyst in another post. Most likely a political decisionCommenting on a The Block article about the motivations behind the sudden pivot to a spot Ethereum ETF approval, Seyffart agreed with undisclosed sources that stated this is “a completely unprecedented situation, which means it’s entirely political,” and that “they’re not even internally coordinated yet, which is why this is most likely a political decision.”James’ fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas already suggested this in a Monday X post, saying that rumors around the SEC shift in stance pointed to “political issues.”Seyffart concludes his series of posts on X by admitting that he was wrong about a spot Ethereum ETF approval not happening this week, but so was the entire market. Notably, as reported by Crypto Briefing, not even notorious fund managers were expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US this week. Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said that “most people are universally expecting a disapproval order.” VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial during a CNBC interview.

Standard Chartered Maintains $8,000 ETH Price Target as it Expects Green Light for Ether ETFs This Week | Cryptoglobe


                                
Standard Chartered, a British multinational banking and financial services company, has revealed it expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the listing of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country this week, and maintained its $8,000 price target for ETH.



The bank’s Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research reportedly told The Block that with key deadlines for spot Ether ETF applications looming – May 23 for VanEck and May 24 for Ark 21 Shares – the bank is “80% to 90%” sure that these funds will be approved.



The potential impact is significant. Standard Chartered estimates that these spot Ether ETFs could attract significant investment, bringing in 2.39 to 9.15 million ETH within the first year, translating to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion in U.S. dollars in a figure that it sees as “proving accurate” according to estimates for inflows for the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.



Looking beyond approval, the bank’s analysis suggests Ether’s price could keep on climbing rapidly this year and maintain a 5.4% price ratio with the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which would suggest an $8,000 price target by the end of the year if BTC maanges to hit $150,000 as it predicts.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Earlier this year the bank revealed it was expecting spot Ether ETF applications to be approved by May 23 , but given the market’s expectations of a rejection earlier this month the bank had said that delays in the approval were already “priced in.”



Standard Chartered’s prediction comes after a dramatic rise in cryptocurrency prices related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



 Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.

Trump campaign leans in on crypto with new donation page amid shifting political landscape

Former President Donald Trump has begun accepting crypto donations for his re-election campaign, making him the first US Presidential candidate to adopt digital assets for funding.According to a May 21 statement:“This addition to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.”The website’s available information showed that crypto users could donate in different digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others.Crypto has become a pivotal topic in the lead-up to the November elections, with former President Trump and President Joe Biden expected to be the primary candidates for their respective parties.The candidates have taken a diverging stance toward the emerging industry, with Trump openly supporting crypto and promising to foster its growth through proper regulation. Trump stated:“Democrats, like Biden and his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren, continue to believe only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world.”However, recent events suggest that the Biden administration may shift its long-standing hardline stance against the space.Ethereum ETFOn May 20, reports surfaced that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a stark pivot from earlier expectations.Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the SEC’s turnaround might have political motivations, a view shared by many in the crypto community.Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said:“If the spot ETH ETF is approved, it will be a true shock to everyone I know in DC who’s close to this process. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen. It means approval could signal a major shift in US crypto policy.”Congressional developmentLast week, US lawmakers from both parties united to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) resolution despite President Biden’s stated intent to veto the bill.Several crypto stakeholders have argued that the bulletin was controversial, as SAB 121 required financial institutions to safeguard customer assets and keep them on their balance sheets. Notably, the American Bankers Association (ABA) pointed out that the regulation made it difficult for banks to act as spot Bitcoin ETF custodians.This rare bipartisan event precedes the upcoming Senate vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), widely considered the most significant piece of crypto-specific legislation likely to become law.The FIT21 bill will establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the digital assets industry in the US. The bill has widespread industry support from key players, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Andreessen Horowitz.Moreover, the bill will establish a baseline for classifying digital assets as securities or commodities. It expands the CFTC’s authority to register and regulate digital commodities and requires the FTC and SEC to jointly issue rules for assets not otherwise classified.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

VanEck's Ethereum spot ETF listed on DTCC under ticker $ETHV - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            VanEck’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF has appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker $ETHV. This development comes shortly after Cboe released amended 19b-4 forms.
ETHV: VanEck’s Ethereum ETF Awaits SEC Approval, Listed on DTCCWhile the DTCC listing is a crucial step for the ETF, it does not guarantee the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval, which is still pending.VanEck’s spot Ethereum ETF application will likely be the first to get a decision from the SEC. The SEC will decide whether to deny or approve the product.Van Eck filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in September 2023. Many other industry giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity also followed suit.The outlook for Ethereum-based funds was previously not promising as people involved in conversations with the SEC stated that there was an ongoing lack of engagement.However, things started to take a turn just a few days before the May 23 verdict. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate there is now a 75% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. They cite staking removal and political issues as the key drivers.Standard Chartered is also confident in the regulatory approval potential of the spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the bank is bullish on Ethereum’s price, projecting that it is on track to hit $8,000 by year-end.Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive performance following positive developments in the Ethereum ETF. Ethereum surged 8% after Bloomberg analysts raised the odds and extended its rally, breaking through its $3,500 key level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up 31% in the last 7 days.

Dogecoin Bulls On The Rise: Analyst Highlight Path To $0.2


																Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is currently demonstrating signals that suggest it might be on the cusp of a significant bullish breakout.
According to a recent analysis from prominent crypto analyst Ali, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency appears to be approaching a crucial resistance level, with market behaviors hinting at potential upward movement.

	Related Reading



Eyes Set On Breaking The $0.2 Resistance Level
Ali, a well-known market analyst, pointed out that Dogecoin is testing the possibility of reaching its highest price level in over a month at $0.2. His analysis is based on DOGE’s recent escape from a descending triangle pattern, which typically suggests a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers.
Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement.
This movement has led Ali to highlight the market’s tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level.

This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin’s push toward this key price point.
Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase.

Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal
The positive movement in DOGE’s price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE’s open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass.

Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded. This can be a sign of strengthening market activity and a supportive factor for the ongoing price increase.
Echoing Ali’s sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE’s price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

According to this analysis, Dogecoin is showing signs of bullish behavior, with immediate resistance near $0.15950. However, since DOGE already surpassed that, the analyst noted other resistance levels at $0.16980 and $0.18440.

‘All Bets Are Off’ - Top Analyst Unveils Crypto Market Forecast Amid Increased Odds of Ethereum ETF Approval - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist says that a certain altcoin group will massively benefit from the approval of a spot market Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 554,400 followers on the social media platform X that while an Ethereum ETF might be a bit bearish for Bitcoin (BTC) inflows, it will be bullish for Ethereum and an altcoin cohort that has yet to see big rallies.










“Think ETH ETF would take quite a bit of bid away from BTC. Think ETH ETF would lead to ETH going up which would lead to more stupidity in the market. Think it’s good news ETH alts only basically, but that’s worth a lot given they’ve been depressed for so long they’re dirt cheap.”
Yesterday, the crypto market took off amid reports that an Ethereum ETF now has a 75% chance of getting the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
According to DonAlt, an Ethereum ETF will give the crypto markets a massive shot in the arm.
“Anyway if we get an ETH ETF all bets are off. Retardation can go to new ATH (all-time high) levels and we’ll all be friends again. Shit would be wild in my opinion and would change my mind on a lot of things short term.” 
The analyst names one altcoin that will likely witness a breakout rally if an Ethereum ETF gets approved.
“[Pepe is] the main ETH memecoin. I’d rather not fade it if we truly get an ETH ETF. Still technically below resistance but I don’t like the chances that holds.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
At time of writing, Pepe (PEPE) is trading at $0.0000111, well above DonAlt’s resistance level.

US DOJ Seizes $100M In Crypto From Major Dark Web Drug Trafficking Operation | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent crackdown on illicit transactions involving crypto assets, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Rui-Siang Lin, a 23-year-old individual from Taiwan. Lin, who also goes by the names Pharoah and Faro, is accused of owning and operating a dark web drug marketplace known as the “Incognito Market.” 
The platform allegedly facilitated anonymous crypto-based transactions of illegal narcotics with a total value of more than $100 million worldwide.
$100 Million Crypto Operation Exposed
According to the complaint and indictment, Incognito Market emerged in October 2020 as an online narcotics bazaar operating on the dark web. Until its closure in March, the marketplace facilitated the sale of over $100 million worth of crypto in narcotics, including substantial quantities of cocaine and methamphetamines. 

Accessible to global users with internet connectivity, Incognito Market could be reached via the Tor web browser on the darknet. Lin, operating under the online pseudonyms “Pharoah” or “Faro,” acted as the market leader and oversaw all its operations, including employees, vendors, and customers. 
US Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York highlighted that Lin’s alleged operation exploited the community for personal profit, emphasizing that criminal actors would be pursued regardless of whether they operated on street corners or the “dark corners of the internet.” 
Dark Web Drug Lord Arrested
According to the DOJ, Incognito Market was designed to facilitate seamless narcotics transactions worldwide by incorporating features commonly seen on legitimate e-commerce sites, such as branding, advertising, and customer service. 
Users reportedly gained access to the marketplace by logging in with unique usernames and passwords, allowing them to search thousands of listings for the drugs of their choice. 
It is further alleged that the platform sold illegal narcotics and misbranded prescription drugs, including heroin, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, oxycodone, methamphetamines, ketamine, and alprazolam. 
To become a vendor on Incognito Market, individuals had to register with the site and pay an admission fee. In exchange for listing and selling narcotics, vendors paid 5% of the purchase price to Incognito Market. Lin accumulated millions of dollars in profits from the operation. 
Interestingly, the marketplace had a “bank” that allowed users to deposit crypto assets into their “digital bank accounts.” After a transaction, the cryptocurrency was transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s account, with Incognito Market taking a 5% fee. 

Lin was arrested on May 18 at John F. Kennedy Airport, and he is set to appear before US Magistrate Judge Willis in Manhattan federal court. 
If found guilty, Lin faces severe penalties, including a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for narcotics conspiracy, a maximum sentence of 20 years for money laundering, and a maximum sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to distribute narcotics.

XRP starts to rise amidst Ethereum ETF hopes: What's next? - AMBCrypto



XRP holders rejoiced as prices advanced toward a key resistance zone.
The on-chain metrics showed accumulation but also warned of potential selling pressure.

Ripple [XRP] saw a moderate price jump on the 20th of May. It gained 6.13% in a 24-hour window and during the same time, Bitcoin [BTC] climbed by 6.9% but saw a minor dip from $71.3k to $70.9.
Despite the gains, XRP continued to trade within a long-term range and faced a strong supply zone at $0.57-$0.585.
The Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval chances were upgraded to 75% from 25% by Eric Balchunas and saw the token’s prices rocket upward by 20% within a few hours.
The ETF analyst added that it took everyone by surprise.
This could lead to spot ETFs being filed for other cryptos. As one of the largest tokens in the market, XRP could be among the next cryptos that ETF issuers submit applications for.
Yet, the ongoing SEC-XRP case remains a hurdle for issuers.
Crypto markets are jumpy and investors need to watch out
In November 2023, XRP surged to $0.7503 because of fake reports that BlackRock had filed for a spot XRP ETF. A month before this event, false news of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval saw BTC prices surge by 10%.
In both cases, the strong gains were quickly reversed. Therefore, while XRP might see vast price pumps due to such reports or speculation, it will do little to embolden investor confidence.
Hence, AMBCrypto analyzed social and network metrics to understand if the token might see a genuine rally in the coming months.

The daily Weighted Sentiment has been positive for a good chunk of the past month. During this time, XRP made higher lows, but still struggled to form a long-term uptrend.
The Social Volume remained consistent over the past month but has reduced noticeably from March.
The Open Interest also rose higher to show speculators were gaining confidence in going long. Yet, the recovery has been slow compared to the fall in April.

The MVRV ratio showed that investors have been at a loss since the mid-March correction. It fell to -19% on the 14th of April and was at -3.83% at press time.

Meanwhile, the mean coin age continued to trend higher to signal network-wide accumulation. Together, they signaled a buying opportunity.
Worryingly, the dormant circulation spiked during the recent rally. This suggested increased token movement, likely for selling. This might hinder the bulls’ attempts at a recovery and drag prices lower.

                        As hype builds that spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the USA might be imminent and Ether pushes to fresh two-month highs above $3,800, traders are hunting for the best crypto to buy now that might hand them the quickest gains in the current market environment.Multiple potential Ethereum ETF issuers submitted amended 19b-4 applications on Tuesday.And some tickers are already being listed on the DTCC.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading a little lower in the past 24 hours around $70,200. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, dipped 4% back under $180.Attention will shift momentarily to the macro backdrop when the Fed releases the minutes of its April meeting on Wednesday.But Ethereum ETF newsflow will likely continue to dominate the headlines this week. That potentially leaves the market with significant near-term upside risks.Imagine Ethereum ETFs get approved and launched, and then demand is stronger than expected. That’s what happened with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.Ethereum could be about to launch back above $4,000. Even though its up 35% up versus recent lows, ETH could still be the best crypto to buy now.That being said, some traders are hunting higher beta plays.Here are some strong-performing altcoins that might offer even greater upside potential than Ethereum.Best Crypto to Buy NowPepe (PEPE)Pepe (PEPE) has jumped more than 50% in the past two days to fresh record highs above $0.000014.Last at $0.00001375, its market cap is just under $5.8 billion as per CoinMarketCap.But Pepe could yet go higher. Traders appear to be piling into the token to express bets on Ethereum ecosystem growth.And Pepe still has a long way to go to catch up to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.It could still 5x from current levels this bull market. That makes Pepe potentially the best crypto to buy now.Arbitrum (ARB)A major underperformer since March, layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum’s ARB token is attempting to pick up.ARB recently surged back above $1.20 for the first time in a month. It’s also now back above its 21 and 50DMAs.ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewQuick 2x gains could be instore for ARB, as traders bet on Ethereum ecosystem growth, which would directly benefit Arbitrum.Arbitrum is a leading Ethereum layer-2 protocol, but currently only has a market cap of around $3.2 billion.That leaves plenty of room for growth this bull market. ARB could thus be one of the best crypto to buy now.Uniswap (UNI)The native token of multi-chain DEX Uniswap (UNI) is another outperforming crypto since the SEC’s u-turn on Ethereum ETFs.Uniswap was recently hit by a Wells Notice from the agency. Its outperformance could be related to hopes the SEC takes a softer-than-initially-feared stance against them after the Ethereum u-turn.Either way, UNI is picking up fast and hard. The token was last at $9.65, up 25% in two days.A break above resistance either side of the $10 level could open the door to a further push higher.Indeed, UNI could soon retest yearly highs around $17, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Sealana (SEAL)
If Ethereum ETFs are coming, that could be a risk on trigger to start a new meme coin season.While Ethereum is currently in focus, Solana has been the go-to trading venue for meme coins this year.Established Solana meme coins like dogwifhat are a good bet. But their already bloated market caps reduce upside potential.For 50-100x gains, traders need to find newer meme coins.One new Solana meme coin that analysts at Cryptonews think has lots of potential is Sealana (SEAL).SEAL features an overweight, South Park-themed, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called Sealana.The seal mascot has already attracted over $2.2 million in funds from eager investors.Sealana’s marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a blockbuster presale.However, following launch, its token subsequently pumped to a market cap of over $100 million, as per DEXTools.Rumors suggest the Slothana and Sealana teams are in some way related. Traders will thus be hoping SEAL matches SLOTH’s success.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on Sealana’s official website with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

                        The current Bitcoin bull market is falling short of the highs of 2017, Russian experts claimed on May 20.The comments came in a Bitcoin- and crypto-themed report from the Roscongress Foundation, one of Russia’s biggest development-focused NGOs and conference organizers.‘Bitcoin Bull Market Fever Will Falter’ – Experts Weigh in
The report’s authors claimed that BTC’s new all-time-high peak in March this year was part of a “speculative game” played “against the backdrop of spot Bitcoin ETFs approvals.”However, March’s sudden growth in Bitcoin prices has since “failed to cause a stir similar to the situation at the end of 2017,” they wrote.The authors pointed to internet search engine queries “related to cryptocurrencies,” which have “remained well below peak values.”The authors added that only half as many people worldwide were searching for BTC and crypto-related themes in 2024 as was the case in 2017.Better Bitcoin Access Thanks to ETF Approval, Say Experts
Experts also noted that analysts had claimed spot Bitcoin ETFs would “make cryptocurrency investments more accessible to a wider range of people.”All-time Bitcoin prices. (Source: CoinMarketCap)But the evidence appears to suggest this has not yet happened, the foundation claimed.The authors explained that the “mining-based transaction protocols of the Bitcoin network” are an “obstacle” to “full inclusion” in the traditional financial system. The authors wrote:“Generally, cryptoassets are still a poor fit for full integration in the traditional financial system. The main thing holding back traders is the fact that cryptoassets are not suitable for offsetting.”A Roscongress Foundation summit. Source: (RC Dreamteam/YouTube)In the financial world, offsetting (aka “netting”) refers to “the net presentation of separate assets and liabilities or income and expenses in the financial statements.”The foundation added that market data shows that most investors still see Bitcoin as a “high-risk asset” in the same vein as “tech stocks.”Additionally, the authors claimed that BTC is “much more strongly correlated with stock market movements” than with assets like gold. As such, it fits the profile of a “classic high-risk speculative asset.”The authors also spoke of a “weak reaction” in the Bitcoin market to the April halving event,” and added:“The behavior of an asset is increasingly determined by the general level of willingness of financial market participants to take on risks.”However, the report was not entirely downbeat about BTC or the effect of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. The authors wrote that in the long run:“The emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly make investing in cryptocurrency more accessible to all market participants.”But they said temporary price rises were the result of “speculative play” from traders trying to capitalize on the ETF approvals in Washington.They added that the “range of Bitcoin price forecasts for the end of the year” was “extremely wide.” The authors explained:“At the top end, the average maximum forecast is $121,764, while the average floor is $50,138.”Stablecoins Influencing Bitcoin Prices?
The authors also noted that there had been a “growth of the capitalization of stablecoins” since 2017.Distribution of stablecoins against Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other leading cryptoassets, based on market capitalization, on December 5, 2023. (Source: Statista, CoinGecko)And, they said, this has helped spur a Bitcoin bull market in both 2021 and 2024. The authors wrote:“The first wave of [Bitcoin price] growth in 2017 was caused by the popularization of cryptocurrencies. The second, in 2021, can be explained by a sharp increase in the supply of stablecoins and the transfer of pricing to virtual spaces.”The experts concluded that the 2024 all-time-high peak was “due” in part to “a restoration of the supply of stablecoins.”Earlier this month, Russian experts claimed that BTC and altcoin mining were set to grow by 20-40% before the end of the year.

Bull Run Not Over Yet: Bitcoin Price Could Move to New All-Time High on New Short Squeeze, Willy Woo Says | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin has recently surged to surpass the $71,000 mark, while the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum moved up over 20% in a single day, with an analyst now suggesting an upcoming short squeeze could lead to new highs.



According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, the price of BTC surged over 6.5% in a single day and ETH moved up to the $3,800 in a massive daily move over a short squeeze that liquidated one month of short positions on BTC.



That short squeeze, he suggested, could be followed by another one that would see the price of the flagship cryptocurrency moves to a new all-time high. Bitcoin, it’s worth noting, is currently very close to its all-time high, which was slightly above the $73,500 mark.







Data shows a dramatic decrease in short BTC positions within the last 24 hours, plummeting from 291 BTC to just 165, indicating that nearly half of these bearish bets were liquidated as Bitcoin’s price climbed rapidly. This triggered a cascade of buy orders from those scrambling to cover their short positions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Perennial Bitcoin HODLers Bought Big Ahead Of Rally: Data


								On-chain data shows that Bitcoin addresses with zero sales histories participated in a big accumulation before this recovery run started.
Bitcoin Inflows To Accumulation Addresses Sharply Spiked Recently
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the accumulation addresses on the Bitcoin network have shown some significant inflow activity recently.
The “accumulation addresses” here refer to the Bitcoin wallets that have never made outgoing transactions on the blockchain. In other words, the accumulation addresses are basically the HODLers of the network.
Not every address with zero history of selling is included in this cohort, though, as there are some other requirements. The address must have at least two incoming transactions, the last of which must have occurred within the past seven years.

These exist because a wallet with only one transfer wouldn’t set a pattern one way or the other, and addresses that have been inactive for more than seven years are more likely to have reached old age by being lost rather than through HODLing.
Only the addresses holding greater than 10 BTC are counted under the accumulation addresses. Naturally, exchange—and miner-related wallets are excluded from this cohort, as they represent the perennial sell side of the market, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from these HODLers.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going into the combined balance of this group over the past year or so:

The value of the indicator appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, these accumulation addresses saw extremely large inflows on the 15th of this month. More particularly, these HODLers received 17,800 BTC to their balance with this spike.
At the time of these inflows, the cryptocurrency price was around $61,600, so the purchases would have cost these investors almost $1.1 billion.
Interestingly, the asset’s price started on a recovery run soon after this buying spree, culminating in the asset surpassing the $71,000 mark earlier in the past day.
The accumulation from these HODLers might have naturally been a factor behind the rally, but it most likely wasn’t the sole reason. Rather, it would appear that these are potentially smart-money investors who anticipated the rally, so they bought in at the lows.

The chart shows that the indicator registered two extreme spikes earlier in the year as well. Following both of these, the cryptocurrency witnessed some bullish price action.
The accumulation has certainly paid off for these Bitcoin HODLers this time, as the stack that they bought is now worth more than $1.24 billion.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,600, up 13% over the past week.

Altcoins ‘Maniac Phase’ Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up


																The crypto industry has seen a positive shift with the recent market recovery. After a Q1 full of bullish sentiment, Q2 saw many sectors of the crypto space brewing a pessimistic feeling toward altcoins.

	Related Reading



Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a “massive leg higher” for the alt season.
Ethereum’s Surge Refuels Sentiment
The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day.
Similarly, the “king of altcoins” remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)’s price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March.
However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being “a major disappointment.”
In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors’ bullish tank, “erasing 65 days of down only” with a single daily candle.
As ETH rallies, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‘Crypto Money Flow Cycle’, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, “it’s time for Altcoins to rally.”
Is The Altcoins Season Here?
During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins’ run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn’t “run that hard” during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months “cool-off” period before resuming the uptrend.
Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time.
Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the “maniac phase” ahead. Crypto Yoddha shared his chart for the 2024 altcoin cycle, stating that the dip was “just a higher low in an uptrend.”

Per the chart, the altcoins market is now looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before testing last cycle’s $1.7 trillion ATH. To crypto Yoddha, “we’re looking at the bullish continuation” that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2.
Similarly, Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction:
The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here.
I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

Lastly, Crypto Jelle considers that “Altcoins are about to embark on a massive leg higher” after an 18-month accumulation period. The analyst compared the market’s recent breakout to a ball being held underwater, claiming that “it’s time for history to repeat.”

Ethereum is not the only reason why Uniswap [UNI] pumped 18% in 24 hours - AMBCrypto



UNI’s price surged after the protocol disclosed a plan to introduce the ERC-7683 standard.
Open Interest hit a monthly high, activity spiked, while the token could rise to $12.

Uniswap [UNI] broke out, rose by 18.98% and hit $9.30 in an unexpected move within the last 24 hours.
For many participants, the surge could be linked to the news that the odds for the U.S. SEC to approve Ethereum [ETH] spot ETFs had increased. Because of this, ETH’s price jumped.
While that played a part, that was not the only reason. According to AMBCrypto’s investigation, a major development and other happenings on-chain were vital to UNI’s breakout.
The Labs come with a new standard
On the 20th of May, Uniswap Labs disclosed that it was introducing a new token standard called the ERC-7683. For context, ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment.
It is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
According to Uniswap Labs, the standard, if deployed, would solve fragmentation on the network and improve cross-chain interaction. The proposal read,
“By implementing a standard, cross-chain intents systems can interoperate and share infrastructure such as order dissemination services and filler networks.”
Moments after the announcement, UNI’s Open Interest (OI) increased. At press time, the OI was $64.90 million. This was a value that the metric has not reached for over a month.
Source: Santiment
Increasing OI indicates that more money is coming into the market. On the other hand, a decreasing OI is a sign of decreasing net positions with liquidity moving out.
Activity rises, sets UNI for another price boost
When put side by side with the price, the OI was a sign that buyers in the market were aggressive. If the value continues to rise, UNI’s price might do the same.
Furthermore, the prediction that the token could rally higher than its March high could come to pass. However, there were other changes on the network that propelled the hike apart from the OI.
One of them was the 24-hour active addresses. Whenever active addresses increase, it means that a large number of users are interacting with the blockchain.
If the metric falls, it means that the number of unique addresses visiting the network is decreasing. For UNI, on-chain data from Santiment showed that active addresses rose to a weekly high of 1926
This sudden surge indicates rising confidence among holders. Most times, this leads to increased buying activity and was surely one of the reasons UNI’s price moved northward.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s UNI’s market cap in ETH terms

In addition, AMBCrypto got confirmation of the increased interest from the volume. At press time, UNI’s volume was $346.65 million.
Should this figure increase while the token’s price rises, then UNI could hit a higher value. Considering the momentum, the price of the cryptocurrency might hit between $12 and $15 within a short period.

                        Fraudsters are targetting South Korean crypto users with an Ethereum-themed scam, token holders in the country said on May 21.According to the South Korean media outlet Asia Time, scammers are sending alarming text messages to smartphone users, warning them that their ETH coins will be “burned” on May 22 if they do not act fast.
Ethereum-themed Crypto Scam ‘Originating from Bogus Exchanges’
The scam comes as police and regulators report that “cybercrime relating to virtual assets” is “on the rise.”Crypto community members took to online meeting places to warn fellow token holders that a “phishing text message” was circulating. One post warned:
“You could easily fall for it, so be careful.”Some warned that scammers use technology that allows their messages to bypass spam filters.Some of the text messages claim to originate from a “global cryptocurrency exchange” named Bit-Finance.The messages warn that “due to” token holders’ “long-term inactivity,” their Ethereum holdings “will be burned on May 22.”Ethereum vs the USD over the past five days. (Source: TradingView)The message informs crypto holders that they should “make withdrawals as soon as possible” to avoid losing their funds.Recipients are prompted to click on a link that will help them understand the process and safeguard their funds.
Community Members Post Warnings
One community member posted a screenshot showing that the senders claimed a total of ETH 54.5 of their funds would be burned if they did not act.The link enclosed appears to navigate smartphone users to a phishing site, where scammers attempt to prompt people to enter wallet details and passwords.The media outlet noted that “cyber ​​fraud using real virtual assets is increasing” in South Korea.Last year, the National Police Agency said that it had dealt with 167,688 cyber fraud cases over the course of the year. That represents a 7.68% increase on 2022 figures.“Crimes using virtual assets” accounted for 38.3% of the 2023 total, the police agency explained.Citizens have also filed a total of 2,209 reports to the regulatory Financial Supervisory Service from January to April this year.In each case, victims claimed they had suffered financial losses because of crypto scammers.The regulator said that 17.7% of these cases are related to phishing attacks. It has previously claimed that crypto-themed phishing is “rampant” in South Korea.
Police Vow to ‘Fight Back’
Police experts said the rise in attacks was an “opportunistic” move from scammers, with crypto markets buoyant.In recent months, South Korean markets were spurred when many exchanges began offering commission-free crypto trading.This, experts agreed, has also led to a rise in transaction volumes – and a subsequent rise in phishing attacks.An official from the Cyber ​​Investigation Unit at the National Police Agency said that crypto criminals were increasingly making use of so-called “daepo phones.”This term refers to cell phone numbers created using stolen name and social security number credentials. The official said:
“Recently, fraud has become more sophisticated. There has been an increase in virtual asset-related crimes using daepo phones, and chat apps like KakaoTalk and Telegram. However, we are fighting back. We are using investigation methods that track the flow of transactions.”Last month, South Korean media outlets reported that phishing attackers are now carefully targeting credit card users and the victims of crypto scams.Typically, these attackers try to drive their victims onto fake crypto exchanges and wallet platforms.

Dogecoin: Is a major rally coming? Key levels that say yes - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s current trading momentum and a symmetrical triangle pattern indicate a possible breakout above key resistance levels.
Increased Open Interest and volume suggest strong market activity, with potential for Dogecoin to hit the $0.3 mark.

Dogecoin [DOGE] has been experiencing a notable increase in market value, trading at $0.1641, marking an 8.6% rise over the past 24 hours, and extending its weekly gain to nearly 10% at press time. 
This uptrend aligned with the broader bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased attention and investment into the meme coin. 
The surge in Dogecoin’s price is not only a reflection of current market dynamics, but also a sign of growing investor confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains.
Amid this positive market trend, analysts have spotted significant technical patterns in Dogecoin’s price movements. 
Particularly, Crypto Daily Trade Signals, a well-known crypto analyst, has spotted a symmetrical triangle pattern on the Dogecoin chart. 
 
Source: Crypto Daily Trade Signals/X
This pattern is often seen as a consolidation phase that precedes a breakout or breakdown in price, indicating that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of continuing its upward trajectory.
Dogecoin: Technical analysis and future projections
The symmetrical triangle pattern identified by analysts suggested that Dogecoin faced a major resistance level at $0.1545, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) provides strong support at $0.1513. 
At press time, Dogecoin’s market price was above this 50-day EMA, suggesting a bullish trend. 
However, for this upward trend to be confirmed, Dogecoin needs to break past the resistance at $0.1595, as pointed out by Crypto Daily Trade Signals.
Further supporting this bullish outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 50 mark, indicating a buying trend in the market. 
Dogecoin’s immediate resistance levels are at $0.1595, followed by $0.1698 and $0.1844. If Dogecoin can successfully overcome these levels, it could pave the way for more significant price increases. 
On the other hand, if the price falls below the pivot point around $0.15100, caution is advised, though the current RSI suggests there is room for profit.
Open interest in Dogecoin has also seen a significant increase, up by 16.64% in the past 24 hours, with a current value of $946.56 million.
Rising interest
This rise in Open Interest, accompanied by a nearly 100% increase in volume to $2.76 billion in the past day, underscored the growing market activity and investor interest in Dogecoin.
Source: Coinglass
Despite the bullish metrics, not all market participants are benefiting from the current trend. Dogecoin’s total liquidations sit at over $400,000, with long traders experiencing the majority of these losses. 
This points to a market that, while trending upwards, still presents risks, especially for those on the wrong side of price movements.

Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s price chart indicates a potential breakout from the previous lower low around $0.168.

If Dogecoin can breach this level, a minor retracement might follow, potentially setting the stage for a strong upward movement.

AMBCrypto’s recent analysis supported this view, suggesting that a breakout above the $0.166–$0.17 range could clear the path for Dogecoin to approach the $0.3 mark.

ADA Price Underperforms: Can Cardano Catch Up with Other Altcoins?


																Cardano (ADA) is struggling to start a fresh increase above the $0.500 resistance zone. ADA must stay above the $0.480 support to start a decent upward move.

ADA price is struggling to gain bullish momentum above the $0.50 zone.
The price is trading above $0.480 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.
There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.500.

Cardano Price Remains Supported
In the past few days, Cardano started a recovery wave from the $0.4620 zone, but lagged behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price broke the $0.4750 and $0.480 levels to move into a short-term bullish zone.
The price even spiked above $0.50 but it failed to continue higher. A high was formed at $0.510 and recently there was a downside correction. The price declined below the $0.4980 support. It dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4614 swing low to the $0.510 low.
Cardano is now trading above $0.480 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4614 swing low to the $0.510 low.

Diamond Hands? Trader Turns $1,360 into $2.3 Million with Little-Known Solana-Based Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
A ‘diamond trader’ has managed to, over the course of five months, turn around $1,360 into over $2.3 million to secure a gain of over 170,000% after spending 12 Solana (SOL) tokens to buy a meme-inspired cryptocurrency late last year.



According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the trader bought 5.21 million $PONKE tokens on December 24, 2024 and has since held onto them as the price of the cryptocurrency rose, with their holdings now being worth $2.32 million.







The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has recently surged amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that saw the space add over $200 billion to its market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Before any trading can begin, issuers of spot Ether ETFs must receive the go-ahead on their S-1 registration statements, with the SEC having no set deadline to review these filings.



The SEC’s ongoing investigation into Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has intensified over the last few months, especially after the network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.



Should Ether be classified as a security, it could provide the SEC with a basis to deny the applications for spot Ether ETFs.

Miss the Notcoin pump? Better focus on L1 tokens!



                    

The market has been quite chaotic over the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 23% but has been gaining positions during the last week. As always, Bitcoin is the driver of the crypto space; once it moves, we can expect the rest of the coins to start gaining momentum.







The exceptions, as always, are new projects. The launch of Notcoin, a tokenized equivalent of game points that people were collecting on a Telegram game, was eagerly awaited by more than 5 million people. However, as we can see in the graphic, it followed a typical pattern for new projects: a huge spike followed by a sell-off. This is when market makers primarily generate revenue. After this initial phase, we typically see a steady decline in price as market makers consolidate their positions before the next possible move. We can expect the price to drop to around 0.0035. It’s likely we will see frequent pumps and dumps with this asset.








For those looking for a more stable but steadily growing portfolio, I would suggest focusing on Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) tokens, as their potential to rise is quite significant over the next couple of weeks, assuming Bitcoin continues its climb towards all-time highs.



Now, let’s review some potential tokens that are consolidating at the bottom and have not yet started their upward movement. Here are a few interesting options: Arbitrum, Aptos, Sui, and Vara. We can see that the tokens of all these projects have reached support levels and are now rebounding. But which one of them has the most potential?



Please note, this is not investment advice. I am merely analyzing the information the graphics provide.




Arbitrum



ARB dropped 60.66% from the local high when this correction started. We can see it had a false breakout with two candles, but there was no impulse, and it is once more consolidating near the level of 0.8981. If there is no rebound in the next two days, it is highly likely we will see ARB’s price drop to 0.7705.







Aptos



APT dropped 62% during this correction. It is highly likely that we will still see it go down to 7.3, with a significant possibility of a false breakout. Thus, in the next couple of days, a downtrend is highly probable, with consolidation around the level of 7.34, including a false breakout towards the level of 6.78.








Sui



SUI experienced a drop close to 60%, similar to its peers, but managed to stop at 59.37%. It had a nice rebound at the level of 0.8856 and is showing good bullish signals. This token is definitely worth watching.







Vara network



VARA proved to be one of the strongest tokens among its peers, dropping just 51.26%. It is consolidating around 0.07753, and as we can see, we can expect a rebound towards the level of 0.099 over the next couple of days. Vara has shown strong impulse movements and a steadier downtrend. So, while this is not investment advice, this token should definitely be on our watch list.







In conclusion, I would closely monitor VARA, as it has significant potential and appears to be underestimated by the market for now. SUI also looks promising with its rising possibilities.

Trump’s 2024 Campaign Now Welcomes Crypto Donations


On May 21, former US President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign launched a fundraising page allowing federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via Coinbase Commerce.
Trump’s embrace of crypto signals a sharp contrast with the current administration’s stance on digital assets.
Trump’s Campaign Accepts Up to 8 Cryptocurrencies

According to the campaign’s announcement, supporters can visit the designated website to make donations to the Trump campaign with crypto. All contribution limits and disclosure requirements for crypto donations will adhere to Federal Election Commission regulations.
In the announcement, Trump’s campaign emphasized that he aims “to reduce government control over Americans’ financial decision-making. He also sees accepting crypto donations reflects his “commitment to an agenda that values individual freedom over increased socialistic government control.”

“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army, moving the campaign to victory on November 5!” The announcement reads.


The statement citing MAGA is particularly interesting, given that MAGA is a Trump-themed meme coin. It seems that Trump wants to symbolize the campaign’s embrace of crypto through this asset.
The campaign accepts several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), USDC, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), 0x (ZRX), and Shiba Inu (SHIBA). Supporters can donate in custom amounts or select from predefined options such as $20.24, $2,024, $45, $47, and $4547. The 45 and 47 numbers represent Trump’s presidential campaign message that he was the 45th president of the US and aims to be the 47th president.

However, it is important to note that while the announcement claimed Trump as the “first major party nominee” to accept crypto donations, he is not the official nominee until July. Additionally, in 2015, Senator Rand Paul from the Republican Party accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
This move follows Trump’s promise at a recent event at Mar-a-Lago, where he assured supporters they could donate in crypto. He also pledged a more welcoming approach to the crypto industry, criticizing current US regulatory measures as “hostility.”

His current crypto-focused political move comes when President Joe Biden’s administration shows a tougher stance toward the digital assets industry. This shift is notable, considering Trump was a crypto skeptic during his first presidency from 2017 to 2021.
Nonetheless, many believe that Trump’s presidency could bring a positive outlook for the crypto industry. BeInCrypto previously reported that Standard Chartered’s researcher Geoffrey Kendrick noted that Trump’s administration might adopt less stringent regulatory measures for crypto than the current Biden administration.

This potential policy shift could encourage foreign official buyers of US treasuries to explore alternative financial assets like Bitcoin. Such exploration could potentially drive its price upwards.

Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff's Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTC - Benzinga

Gold bull and staunch Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, used the recent euphoria around Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF approvals to attack King Crypto's prospects.What Happened: Schiff wrote in an X post that a potential Ether spot ETF approval could be a bearish event for the world's largest cryptocurrency.He argued, "But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to crypto won’t increase that allocation to buy Ether."Put simply, Schiff argued that the existing Bitcoin ETF investors would eventually sell their shares and reallocate them to new Ether ETFs rather than keeping both in their portfolios. Why It Matters: Bitcoin proponents were not amused by the commentary, with one user, Rajat Soni, taking it upon himself to educate the Bitcoin skeptic. He reminded Schiff of Bitcoin's dominant position in the market and that its pump was unrelated to developments around Ether ETFs. "Bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up because of Ether. Ether’s price goes up because of Bitcoin," Soni asserted. Another user named Joby Anderson replied to Schiff that an ETH ETF approval would “just signal to investors that regulatory risk is improving and … promote additional outside investment. You know this.”Bitcoin rallied over $70,000 amid net inflows of nearly $548 million into spot ETFs this week, according to data from SoSo Value. The eleven investment vehicles tracking the spot prices of Bitcoin have raked in around $12.88 billion since their listing in early January.Schiff's skepticism stands antithetical to Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood's forecast of Bitcoin hitting $3.8 million by 2030, provided institutional investors allocate 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin.  Price Action: Bitcoin was trading down 1.6% at $69952, as of 11:55 pm ET, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Trump Accepts Cryptocurrency Donations In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin And More, Says MAGA Supporters ‘Will Build A Crypto Army’Photo via Shutterstock

Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC's Claims: Gears Up For Court Battle



	

Key Points:




Uniswap Labs disputes US SEC allegations.



UNI and LP tokens are claimed not to be securities.



Uniswap is ready to defend its stance in court.




Uniswap Labs challenges SEC’s charges on allegations that its UNI and LP tokens are not securities. The firm is ready to defend itself against the claims in court.





Uniswap Labs has reportedly challenged allegations brought against the company by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based startup disputes a claim that the company operates as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer.



Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC’s Allegations



The SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a Wells notice last month, signaling the intention to recommend legal action against Uniswap Labs.



Marvin Ammori, the chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs, told a press conference that the SEC based the case on the incorrect assumption that all tokens are securities.




Ammori clarified that tokens are a file format and not a security per se. The chief legal officer also warned the commission that legal action risks an adverse decision and possibly clipping the commission’s wings as far as the authority to regulate crypto tokens is concerned.

Tokens are Not Securities, Says Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer



Uniswap Labs argues that the UNI tokens the governance token for Uniswap are not securities under the Howey Test, the legal guideline defining investment contracts.



The company also states that LP tokens special tokens awarded to users contributing to liquidity pools on Uniswap are not securities but accounting tools that keep track of a user’s assets and any fees they might earn.





Ammori said that Uniswap Labs was ready to defend the company’s position in court: “We will litigate if we have to, and if we litigate, we will win.”



All these happen while SEC Chairman Gary Gensler continues to insist that the regulator has the authority over digital assets, mostly unregistered securities, according to his claims, which are under the rule of the SEC.

Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign Now Allowed To Donate Using Cryptocurrency - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Donald Trump’s presidential campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations, which is the first for a major party candidate.



The campaign aims to counter Biden and Warren’s anti-crypto positions and attract young male voters.



Accepting various cryptocurrencies opens a new funding source for Trump’s campaign.




According to CNBC, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that it will start accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies.





Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign Embraces Cryptocurrency Donations



The decision aligns with Trump’s pledge to embrace digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether, positioning him as the first major party candidate to do so.



Supporters can donate using any cryptocurrency accepted through Coinbase Commerce, according to a campaign press release. This initiative follows Trump’s declaration of support for crypto at a recent Mar-a-Lago gala, marking the digital currencies’ entry into the 2024 campaign.



The announcement also targets President Joe Biden, linking him to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent crypto critic. Warren has campaigned to build an “anti-crypto army” to restrict cryptocurrency use, a stance that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign plans to counter with its own “crypto army.”




New Fundraising Avenue Through Digital Currencies



“This new cryptocurrency option will help build a crypto army, pushing our campaign towards victory on November 5th,” the campaign stated. The move could tap into a new funding stream for Trump’s campaign, which has lagged behind Biden in cash reserves despite strong fundraising efforts in April.



Crypto donations to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign will be treated as in-kind contributions, akin to stock gifts, and are subject to Federal Election Commission regulations on contribution limits and disclosures. The campaign can choose to liquidate the digital assets or hold onto them.



Trump has made previous efforts to engage the crypto community, which tends to be younger and more male. In December, he released NFT trading cards available for purchase with cryptocurrency, and earlier this month, he hosted a dinner for NFT supporters at Mar-a-Lago, urging them to vote for him.



Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has maintained a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrencies. Hours before Trump’s announcement, Biden’s team sent a fundraising text warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are backing Trump.”





While Trump promotes himself as the first major party nominee to embrace crypto donations, he follows in the footsteps of other candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Senator Rand Paul, who previously accepted Bitcoin donations.

Bitcoin mining - Here's why this group is still holding as BTC falls below $70K - AMBCrypto



The Bitcoin miner reserve has increased to its highest level since April.
BTC has fallen below $70K once again.

Recently, Bitcoin [BTC] mining difficulty has decreased, but miners’ revenue has also declined. 
Despite this drop in revenue, miners have yet to start selling off their holdings, even with BTC falling below the $70,000 mark. They are choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin for now.
Bitcoin mining revenue and difficulty declines
According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining difficulty has remained flat for several days. 
The chart analysis shows that the difficulty began decreasing around the 7th of May and continued until the 10th of May. Since then, it has stabilized.
 This implies that solving the block puzzle to add new blocks now requires less time and fewer resources.
Additionally, over 30 days ago, BTC miner revenue surged to over $107 million but then experienced a sharp decline, dropping to $26.4 million by the 1st of May. 
At press time, it was attempting to recover, likely supported by the recent rise in BTC prices, and sat around $34.1 million. This level of revenue is similar to what it was in December 2023.
Miner reserve increase in value
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin miner reserve indicated that it has remained stable over the past few days, holding around 1.816 million BTC at press time. 
Although there have been occasional declines, the reserve has maintained this level since the 6th of May. 
However, the value of this reserve has significantly increased in recent days. The chart showed that the reserve’s value rose from approximately $120 billion to over $129 billion by the 20th of May. 
As of this writing, the reserve’s value is around $129.2 billion.
Source: CryptoQuant
Bitcoin falls below $70k
The increase in the value of the Bitcoin miner reserve is due to the spike in BTC’s prices. On the 20th of May, the price of BTC surged from around $66,000 to over $71,000, a rise of more than 7%. 

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, at press time, BTC had fallen back to approximately $69K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours. 
This price range means that miners’ holdings have become more valuable, even if the volume of their holdings has not significantly increased.

Major Worldwide News Update:			Ethereum saw a significant surge amid growing anticipation for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.

Grayscale Investments, in line with other entities, decided to remove staking from its Ethereum ETF proposal. Fidelity similarly omitted staking from its application.

Donald Trump's presidential campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, positioning him as the first major candidate to embrace crypto contributions.

Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely This Week, Says Top Crypto Analyst: 72-Hour Window 'Weird And Almost Impossible To Establish' - Benzinga

Popular cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe went against the broader market sentiment by suggesting that spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs won't be greenlighted by the SEC this week.What Happened: Van de Poppe, known for sharing crypto investment strategies on social media, said, "Honestly, I think it’s going to be a delay and approval in July/August," amid the ongoing frenzy. The analyst's views drew market interest as the final deadline for the first wave of applications falls on May 23, with VanEck‘s proposal being the first in line.Van de Poppe told Benzinga that the likelihood of approval within a window of 72 hours is "weird and almost impossible to establish." He cited the continued presence of ETH staking in many applications as a factor that could delay approvals. He added that the market would likely respond negatively to the SEC’s refusal, but the grounds for denial would determine the next reaction."If it’s solely the staking part, then it might suggest that we’re going to have an approval, but just later on, and that would automatically lead to a positive build-up at a later point in time," Van de Poppe emphasized.Why It Matters: After a few hours of receiving the aforementioned responses, nearly five applicants amended their filings to remove the staking part — a blockade that Van de Poppe was referring to.Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart maintained a 75% approval chance as of this publication. Meanwhile, VanEck's spot Ether ETF fund was listed on the website of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, according to The Block. While not a confirmation of approval, this step was important in the process of listing the investment vehicles.Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading up 3.26% at $3,759.04, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoiners Scoff At Gold Bull Peter Schiff’s Theory That Ethereum ETF Approvals Could Sink BTCImage via Shutterstock

Trump Adopts Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, Dogecoin, SHIB For Donations


								Former US President Donald J. Trump has announced that his campaign will accept donations in Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone as the first major party Presidential nominee to employ this strategy for fundraising. The announcement came via an official campaign press release.
The Trump campaign’s new fundraising initiative integrates the use of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These can now be donated through Coinbase Commerce, a service that allows merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet.


Trump Goes All In On Bitcoin And Crypto
According to the campaign’s press release, the move adds “to President Trump’s already groundbreaking digital fundraising operation [and] marks the first time a major party Presidential nominee has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.” This initiative is not just a broadening of the campaign’s digital fundraising operation but also a strong political statement in favor of Bitcoin and crypto’s role in enhancing financial freedom and innovation.

The campaign contrasts its embrace of cryptocurrency with the positions of key Democratic opponents, particularly President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have expressed significant skepticism towards the utility and regulation of digital currencies. The press release specifically calls out Senator Warren’s efforts to curtail the crypto sector, which she has often described as a ‘shadowy system’ that needs more stringent regulation.
“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!,” the press release states.
David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who developed the Bitcoin agenda with the Trump campaign, commented via X, highlighting the significance of this move: “Only the start of the Trump news.”

He added, “Max the individual contribution to Trump, make sure to pay in bitcoin or crypto. We have his attention right now. Many decisions are being made. We want to validate this move with impressive numbers and keep him moving… Everything is on the table right now. 3,000 people max out their individual contribution over the next 48 hrs (adds up to ~$10m) Trump is going to be blown away.”
The Trump campaign has clarified that all crypto contributions will adhere strictly to Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. These donations will be reported as in-kind contributions, similar to gifts of stock, providing a transparent framework for how these funds will be accounted for. Donors are directed to a specific page on Trump’s official campaign website where they can complete their transactions through Coinbase Commerce, choosing from a wide range of crypto options.
This strategic move comes at a critical time as Trump’s campaign finances have shown robust growth, even outpacing President Biden in April fundraising totals, according to reports. However, Biden’s campaign still maintains a larger reserve of cash on hand. By opening up the campaign to crypto donations, Trump is not only diversifying his fundraising options, but potentially tapping into crypto voters who are single-issue voters.
While the Trump campaign claims to be the first major party nominee to accept cryptocurrencies, it’s important to note that other political figures have also engaged with crypto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running an independent presidential campaign, and Senator Rand Paul in his 2015 presidential campaign, both accepted Bitcoin. However, the scope and variety of cryptocurrencies now accepted by the Trump campaign set a new precedent in terms of the breadth of digital assets involved.

US Market Dominates Bitcoin Trading Amid ETF Boom


Bitcoin trading during US market hours has surged to unprecedented levels, accounting for 46% of this year’s cumulative volume from January to April.
This increase in trading activity is closely linked to the January launch of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
US Dominates Bitcoin Trading, Asia Lags Behind

Kaiko Research highlights that the volume of Bitcoin trading spikes at the beginning and close of US trading hours. This pattern correlates with the calculation of net asset values for the ETFs at the close of US stock exchanges each weekday. 
Additionally, Thursdays see the highest share of trading during US hours, contributing nearly 15% of the cumulative daily volume.
While Bitcoin trading volume during US hours has rebounded to 2022 levels, volume during Asian trading hours remains significantly lower, Kaiko found. This shift indicates the growing influence of US market activities on Bitcoin trading dynamics.

Additionally, Toby Winterflood, Chief Product Officer of crypto data firm – CCData, noted that the performance of Bitcoin during US market hours reflects muted volatility compared to previous periods. 

“That literally shows you the impact that these ETFs have had, not only on Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P, but also its potential de-correlation with other altcoins and other cryptos,” Winterflood said.

The spot-Bitcoin ETFs have drawn nearly $13 billion in net inflows since their launch four months ago. This makes them one of the most successful product category debuts in industry history. 
Although demand has slowed, with a net $1.3 billion inflow so far in May, the pace seems to be picking up again. In the past two days alone, these ETFs have recorded a cumulative net flow of $542.9 million.
Currently, Bitcoin is trading around the psychological resistance level of $70,000. According to a report by Hashkey, Bitcoin returned five times the S&P 500 from January to April 2024. 

Bitcoin, representing 53% of the entire crypto market cap, delivered a 57% return year-to-date. Whereas S&P 500 recorded 12.20% growth in the same period.

Bitcoin’s typically lower volatility compared to other crypto assets highlights its unique position within the market. Many other crypto assets have returned multiples of Bitcoin’s performance, reflecting the broader volatility and potential rewards within the crypto sector.

Trump Embraces Crypto Donations, Plans to “Build a Crypto Army”

                        Donald Trump has reportedly become the first presumptive Republican presidential nominee to accept cryptos for official campaign donations.The former US President on Tuesday, launched a crypto fundraising page for eligible donors to contribute using the Coinbase Commerce product. The move comes weeks after he declared as the candidate for cryptocurrency at Mar-a-Lago gala that thrust crypto into the 2024 campaign.Per the crypto donation portal, crypto assets including Bitcoin, (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), USD Coin (USDC) and Ox (ZRX) are accepted currently.Crypto donations are subject to standard contribution disclosure requirements from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). That said, it isn’t clear whether the Trump campaign will hold onto the crypto or plans to sell it.The statement further said that the move is a “part of a seismic shift toward freedom.” The announcement “reflects Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control,” it added.Julia Krieger, a Coinbase spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the platform is open to all candidates this election season. “Crypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because it’s cheaper and faster,” she added.Interestingly, the likely GOP flag bearer in the upcoming US elections, isn’t the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency donations.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from ‘We The People,’ announced in May 2023 that his campaign would accept BTC donations. Republican Senator Rand Paul, accepted BTC donations in its 2015 campaign.Building a ‘Crypto Army’
With the new crypto donation option, Trump supporters are planning to build a ‘crypto army’ to fight with the “anti-crypto army” that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has campaigned on.Although Trump is yet to propose any concrete pro-crypto policies, his supporters are already accepting the positive voices in favor of the nascent asset class. This is possibly due to Biden’s administration taking the anti-crypto stance in the past.The Biden administration has taken a cautious approach to cryptos. For instance, in 2022, Biden signed an Executive Order, which aims to develop digital assets in a responsible manner. The Order called on government agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies, with a focus on consumer protection, financial stability and CBDCs.Trump’s Skepticism on Cryptos
Donald Trump, while in office, has expressed some skepticism about cryptos. In 2019, he said that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.” He strongly supported the US Dollars, calling it the “only real currency” in the US.“[Cryptos] are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”However, an official filing that circulated in October 2023 revealed that Trump holds between $250,000 to $500,000 in digital assets, and that he held a majority of assets in Ethereum.Early this year, the former Prez said he would never allow the creation of a CBDC, calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.”

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) Will Surge 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gold Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Gold Pepe has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Gold Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Gold Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gold Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gold Pepe by entering its contract address – 5EZoavSMtfuq3dQuyQsYqUgmD7avZJEZMYpLtpZFBgYz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GOLDPEPE.

Ethereum ETF Issuers Amend SEC Forms, But Launches May Take Months


																“It’s happening,” exclaimed Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on May 22 who added that at least five of the potential ETH ETF issuers have submitted their amended 19b-4s to the Securities and Exchange Commission a few hours ago.
Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Ark 21Shares, and Franklin all submitted amendments via the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
Grayscale filed an updated 19b-4 for their Ethereum Mini Trust earlier in the day.


Not So Fast
The flurry of activity follows an advisory from the SEC to submit revised 19b-4 forms by May 21. A 19b-4 is a form filed by ETF issuers and exchanges proposing to change rules or introduce new products, in this case, spot Ethereum ETPs.
May 23 is the first final deadline for SEC approval or denial for the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF.
It is still a potentially long way from a launch, said Seyffart before adding, “These filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.”
However, there needs to be SEC approval orders on all of the 19b-4s then the regulator needs to approve the S-1 applications, which could take “weeks or more before ETFs launch,” he said.
“Seeing broad misconceptions that ‘approvals’ mean immediate launches of the #Ethereum ETFs. This isn’t necessarily the case. There will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here.”
An S-1 is the initial registration form required for new securities offered to the public. They provide the SEC and potential investors with detailed information about the company’s business operations and products.
The major amendments submitted involved removing anything related to Ethereum staking from the ETF filings, which the SEC has vetoed for these products.
If the issuers could stake the ETH in the funds, they could potentially offer investors greater returns but the regulator was having none of it, still asserting that Ether is a security.
Seyffart maintained approval odds at 75% following an upgrade from 25% earlier this week.
“Also — Yes — our approval odds are still at 75%. Not that it even means anything anymore haha.”
Meanwhile, ETF Store President Nate Geraci did not think that the last-minute SEC U-turn was politically motivated.
ETH Price Outlook
Ethereum prices topped $3,800 on May 21 as ETF hopium heats up. The asset has held on to gains and was trading at $3,750 at the time of writing.
ETH has made a whopping 31% over the past week, most of that coming in a single day.
Bitcoin could not maintain gains, however, dipping below $70,000 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session.

GALA Price Rises 5% After Hack Recovery and DWF Labs Buy


Following yesterday’s security breach, Gala Games announced that the stolen funds had been recovered as Ethereum (ETH).
The Gala Games team said they would use Gala Swap to convert the ETH back to their native token, GALA.
DWF Labs Buys 28 Million GALA as Part of Hack Recovery

Jason Brink, President of Blockchain at Gala Games, shared a link to the on-chain data of the stolen fund return transaction. According to the data, the address labeled as Gala Games Exploiter has returned 5,913 ETH, worth approximately $22.37 million with the current price.

The Gala Games team has also shared a detailed explanation of the incident. They said they immediately activated the blocklist protocol after detecting the suspicious transfer of $200 million in GALA tokens.
As a result, they froze all tokens in the unauthorized wallet 45 minutes after the breach. The team claims that such measures allowed them to minimize the impact of the incident.

“This was an isolated incident on the Ethereum network. […] A new Founder’s Node ecosystem governance vote will soon decide if the blocklisted GALA will be considered burned as it relates to GALA’s dynamic supply distribution model as described in the Gala Ecosystem Blueprint,” they explained.

Gala Games reassured the community that GALA’s minting capabilities on GalaChain remain secure. They also promised to continuously enhance internal controls and security protocols to protect against such incidents.
Additionally, they plan to reimburse anyone subjected to high transactional fees due to the incident. However, they have not detailed their reimbursement plans further.
As part of recovery efforts, Gala Games received help from crypto market maker DWF Labs—one of their partners. DWF Labs announced they purchased 28 million GALA tokens on the open market. Assuming 1 GALA is valued at $0.043, DWF Labs’ acquisition is roughly worth $1.2 million.

DWF Labs outlined that this action aimed to stabilize the token’s value and support Gala Games during these challenging times. This transaction also intends to alleviate market selling pressures and boost investor confidence.

BeInCrypto previously reported that GALA’s price plunged from $0.047 to $0.038 following the hack. However, DWF Labs’ backing and the Gala Games team’s mitigation approaches boosted the market. At the time of writing, GALA’s price has recovered to $0.044, representing an increase of 5.46% in the last 24 hours.

Six Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Have Filed Amended 19b-4 For Upcoming Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Six spot Ethereum ETF applicants, including Fidelity and ARK Invest, amended filings to exclude staking provisions after SEC feedback.



Experts believe removing staking boosts Ethereum’s legitimacy and staking returns.




Six proposed spot Ethereum ETF applicants have updated filings in response to comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the eleventh hour.





Read more: What Is A Spot Ethereum ETF? How Important Is The New Ether ETF?



Spot Ethereum ETF Applicants Are Actively Preparing for SEC Approval



In total, the spot Ethereum ETF applicants include VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, ARK Invest, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy. Such amendments filed with the Cboe exchange include the changes in response to the SEC’s concerns and notably remove staking on the Ethereum blockchain for possible ETFs.



Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and ARK 21Shares specifically removed clauses on the validation of Ethereum proof-of-stake from their proposals. In its revised filing, Fidelity emphasized that neither the Trust nor its related parties would stake in the cryptocurrency. Grayscale also made the same statement in its proxy, removing the staking provisions.




Industry Experts Praise Removal of Staking Provisions



Such changes would be made to satisfy SEC requirements. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, and Ryan Berckmans, an investor in Ethereum, both noted that removing staking could help the overall Ethereum ecosystem by increasing the staking returns and legitimacy of Ethereum without adding risks associated with an ETF.



The Cboe exchange posted these revised 19b-4 filings in a 25-minute window on May 21, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. While the revised filings are a step toward launching, the ETFs still cannot launch until the SEC also approves the corresponding S-1 registration statements. Seyffart noted further that the road to the approval remains long, with revisions still needed for the S-1 forms.



Although the 19b-4 forms might get approved as soon as Thursday, coinciding with VanEck and Cboe’s deadline, the SEC’s position on staking has led to strategic changes by the applicants for the spot Ethereum ETF. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC‘s aversion to allowing staking in ETFs is due to political reasons, pointing out a complex regulatory environment for these financial instruments.

Donald Trump Campaign Is Accepting $XRP, $DOGE, and $SHIB Donations | Cryptoglobe


                                
President Donald Trump’s campaign has launched a fundraising page that allows federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency via the Coinbase Commerce platform. This development is being touted as the first instance of a major party Presidential nominee accepting cryptocurrency donations, expanding the campaign’s digital fundraising methods.



The campaign has indicated that contributions will comply with Federal Election Commission regulations, including contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Supporters can now make federally permissible cryptocurrency donations at Trump Campaign Crypto Donations.







As you can see from the above screenshot, the cryptocurrencies that are being accepted for donations include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, USD Coin, Solana, and 0x.



According to the campaign’s blog post, Trump has focused on reducing regulations and promoting innovation in financial technology during his presidency. The campaign contrasts this with the views of Democratic leaders such as Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are portrayed as favoring increased government control over financial systems.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The campaign suggests that this move reflects a broader effort to enhance individual financial freedom and minimize governmental oversight. They argue that this announcement underscores Trump’s commitment to an agenda prioritizing personal liberty over what is described as “government control.”



Elizabeth Warren has been vocal about her concerns regarding cryptocurrency, reportedly stating her intent to build an “anti-crypto army” to impose stricter regulations on digital currencies. In contrast, the Trump campaign is calling on its supporters to form a “crypto army” to bolster the campaign’s efforts leading up to the election on 5 November 2024.



According to CNBC, this new approach could potentially provide a fresh stream of funds for Trump’s campaign, which, despite raising more money than Biden’s in April, still trails in terms of cash reserves. Per the CNBC article, Biden’s campaign maintains a skeptical stance toward cryptocurrency, reflecting the administration’s cautious approach. Just hours before Trump’s campaign began targeting crypto donors, Biden’s team apparently issued a fundraising message warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.” 



CNBC also points out that while Trump’s campaign claims he is the “first major party nominee” to embrace crypto donations, he is not yet the official nominee.

Hong Kong Privacy Commission Targets Worldcoin: Key Findings


The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD), Hong Kong, has reportedly completed its investigation into Worldcoin. 
The investigation found significant violations of the Personal data (privacy) regulations. 
Hong Kong Has Been Probing Worldcoin Since December 2023

According to Hong Kong-based media outlet RTHK, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling issued an enforcement notice against Worldcoin. The notice demands the immediate cessation of iris and facial image collection using scanning devices.
The investigation revealed that Worldcoin’s practices in Hong Kong were excessive and unnecessary. Specifically, the retention of personal data for up to ten years to train AI models for identity verification was deemed excessive. Additionally, the collection, retention, transparency, access, and correction of personal data were all found to be in breach of the ordinance.
Worldcoin reportedly failed to adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection and their rights to access and correct personal data was a key issue. Moreover, the project faced criticism for its lack of Chinese versions of privacy statements and consent forms.

The PCPD noted that staff did not explain or confirm participants’ understanding of these documents. Furthermore, they did not inform them of the risks associated with disclosing biometric data.
From December 2023 to January 2024, the PCPD conducted ten undercover operations at six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong. Following a court-authorized entry into operation sites, the investigation concluded that 8,302 people had undergone facial and iris scanning for identity verification. These participants submitted to iris scanning to verify their human identity, creating an iris code for registered identity verification.

“With the view to protecting the personal data privacy of members of the public, although we have not received any complaints about the project, the office has proactively commenced an investigation against Worldcoin in accordance with established procedures,” Lo Dik-fan, a senior personal data officer, said.

Despite these developments, there has been no significant impact on Worldcoin’s (WLD) price. As of writing, WLD is trading at 5.07, down by 1.59% in the past 24 hours.

The PCPD’s findings are part of broader regulatory challenges Worldcoin faces globally. For example, in Buenos Aires, authorities highlighted discrepancies between Worldcoin’s data handling practices and local regulations. 

Further scrutiny revealed that Worldcoin might have collected data from minors and stored biometric data from Argentine users in Brazil. This situation raises questions about privacy and data sovereignty. If proven, Worldcoin could face a fine of up to 1 billion Argentine pesos ($1.2 million).
In March, Portugal’s data protection authority – CNPD temporarily halted Worldcoin’s data collection, citing risks to citizen data protection. This suspension, affecting over 300,000 Portuguese citizens, followed numerous complaints about unauthorized data collection, particularly from minors.

Other countries, including Spain, have also restricted Worldcoin’s operations due to similar concerns about the safety and ethical implications of biometric data collection.

Polkadot Price Prediction: Is DOT About to Soar Above $10?


																TL;DR

Polkadot (DOT) saw a 7% daily price increase, exceeding the $7.50 mark, with analysts predicting further gains, potentially reaching $10 and beyond.
Analysts such as Michael van de Poppe and Block Diversity envision DOT’s next targets in the $9-$25 range, boosted by the recent introduction of the JAM whitepaper and surpassing important resistance levels.


DOT’s Next Possible Move
The cryptocurrency market is flashing green today (May 21), with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and many more leading digital assets charting impressive ascents. Polkadot (DOT) is also among the notable gainers, registering a 7% daily price increase.
DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Numerous analysts noted the asset’s rally, outlining impressive predictions for the near future. One example is the X user Crypto Thanos, who claimed that the $6-$7.50 range was “for accumulating only,” setting $10 as the next target.
Dippy.eth chipped in, too, suggesting that DOT “wants to break out” from the accumulation zone of $6.90-$7.50. In their view, reclaiming the $7.50 mark might lead to “higher levels.” Recall that the asset surpassed that mark a few hours ago and is currently trading at approximately $7.55 (per CoinGecko’s data).




Crypto Tony touched upon the matter yesterday (May 20) when DOT’s price was hovering around $6.90. The analyst said they are looking for “a safe entry” once the asset exceeds the $7.40 resistance mark. It will be interesting to follow whether the trader will jump into DOT’s ecosystem as promised. 
Previous Forecasts
Another crypto analyst who envisioned a bright future for Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency is Michael van de Poppe. The X user, with over 700,000 followers, recently claimed that DOT has already “bottomed,” especially since the introduction of the JAM whitepaper. According to Michael van de Poppe, DOT’s next price target could be in the $20-$25 range.
Recall that the team behind Polkadot released the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper last month. The upgrade’s goal is to create a more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain environment that integrates the best aspects of both Polkadot and Ethereum technologies.
For their part, Block Diversity predicted a price rally toward $9, $11, and eventually $13 based on DOT clearing the major resistance level of $6.90.

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAYELON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gay Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin.



Gay Elon Musk launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gay Elon Musk on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Elon Musk by entering its contract address – AErKQkbiSgsRMT1GmS7XW5tWkpSmdT1zdVJCMv1unvBH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYELON.

Is Ethereum 'underpriced' against Bitcoin? Here's what analysts say - AMBCrypto



Analyst claims that an ‘approved’ ETH ETF could attract inflows from US spot BTC ETFs.
Another analyst claims that ETH ETFs might not see outflows like in the GBTC case. 

According to crypto analyst and founder of Lekker Capital, Quinn Thompson, Ethereum [ETH] was grossly undervalued against Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Citing the recent update on potential ETH ETF approval and expected capital inflows, Thompson claimed,
‘This leads me to believe that ETHBTC at 0.05 is still underpriced, particularly given we are in a bull market’ 
The ETHBTC ratio tracks ETH’s performance in BTC terms. An increasing value suggests that ETH is outperforming BTC. However, a drop in the ratio implies that BTC is eclipsing ETH on the price charts. 
The ETHBTC ratio dropped to a low of 0.45 on the 16th of May. However, it has since recovered to above 0.50 following a recent update on ETH ETF approval. 
ETF to boost ETH price?
Thompson claimed that ETH hasn’t been able to attract enough flows because of a lack of ETFs, and the market was obsessed with BTC and Solana [SOL]. 
‘The reason ETH was the ugly middle child between BTC and SOL for the past 6 months was the lack of inflows from an ETF’
However, market watchers have mixed views on whether ETH ETFs will follow the BTC ETF’s path. 
After being converted to an ETF in January, GBTC recorded about $17 billion in cumulative outflows as of the 21st of May.  
Will Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) face a similar fate and dent ETH’s upside potential? 
Crypto analyst James Van Straten was conflicted about the possible outcome. 
Instead, Straten mentioned that the proposed Grayscale Mini Trust (ETH) could alleviate issues like fees that led to massive outflows in GBTC.  
‘The mini trust $ETH may launch at the same time with smaller fees, and investors don’t need to do anything, which wasn’t available for $GBTC.’
The proposed Mini Trust will be a spin-off from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). 
Interestingly, Thompson projected that ETH could attract about 9% of inflows from spot BTC ETFs in the first four months after ‘approval.’ 
If confirmed, the ETHBTC ratio could increase from the current 0.53, fueling the ETH value. 
A Standard Chartered executive held the same bullish stance on ETH post-ETF. 
In an interview with The Block, Standard Chartered’s head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, claimed that ETH ETF could be approved this week. 
Kendrick maintained that ETH could hit $8000 by year-end. He added that ETH ETFs could attract ‘roughly $15 billion to $45 billion’ in inflows in the first 12 months. 
That said, whether ETH eclipses BTC post-ETF launch remains to be seen. In the meantime, the market will focus on the SEC’s decision on the 23rd of May on VanEck’s ETH ETF application.

Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin Talks About Ethereum ETFs: "Be Prepared for These Results If Approved!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

After months of anticipation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears ready to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting the stage for a significant increase in demand for Ethereum (ETH) that could lead to a supply shortage.
Ethereum Co-Founder Predicts Supply Squeeze With Potential Approval of Ethereum ETFs
Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, made a statement about ETFs in an interview.


Lubin explained that institutions investing in Bitcoin through recently launched ETFs are likely to diversify their holdings with Ethereum once spot Ethereum ETFs receive approval.
“There will be a fair amount of natural, pent-up pressure to buy Ethereum through ETFs,” he said. However, this demand may face a more limited supply compared to the Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year.





In January, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, authorized participants — the firms responsible for purchasing Bitcoin on behalf of the ETFs — were able to easily purchase idle coins available on exchanges or through over-the-counter transactions.
However, the situation with Ethereum is different. On-chain data shows that more than 27% of the total Ethereum supply is currently staked on the Ethereum network, generating returns for holders and therefore kept out of direct circulation.



“The bulk of Ethereum is used in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or DAOs,” Lubin said, referring to decentralized autonomous organizations.
This locked supply, combined with Ethereum's market dynamics, could make Ethereum's price more sensitive to expected inflows from ETFs.





Moreover, increased activity on the Ethereum network will trigger the burning of some of the existing Ethereum supply over time, further tightening the current supply. The deflation mechanism introduced by Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade contributes to scarcity by systematically reducing the supply of Ethereum in circulation.
The scenario for Ethereum ETFs could parallel or even exceed the supply pressures faced by Bitcoin ETFs.
Lubin emphasized the broader significance of this development, calling it a “profound turning point” for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

Ethereum Blockchain's Ether (ETH) Token Nearly Adds an Entire Solana (SOL) to Its Market Value

"Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish. Let's not overcomplicate it," Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. "The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,"

How Launchpads Are Fueling a Start-up Investment Boom

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Crypto start-up investing is heating up. The first quarter of 2024 saw a total of $2.52 billion invested in crypto and blockchain projects, according to PitchBook – some 25% higher than Q4 2023. 
And all signs point to an exponential increase throughout the second half of the year. Nearly every day, we’re seeing projects in the DePIN, AI, and GameFi sectors closing bigger and bigger funding rounds, and much of this surge in activity is being fuelled by crypto launchpads.
In crypto, a launchpad is a platform that facilitates the introduction and sale of a new token to the public, typically through a process called an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Launchpads act as an intermediary between crypto projects and investors. They offer a more structured and secure environment for investors and a wide range of start-up services – from regulatory compliance to marketing support. 

For example, Yield App Angel provides access to its established community of 105,000 users with an estimated $20 billion in total crypto assets, along with marketing support, strong KOL relationships, access to top VCs, and so much more. Investors, meanwhile, can choose from a curated selection of vetted projects. 
The Formula to Start-Up Success
There are many examples of projects that successfully raised capital via a launchpad. One name any crypto enthusiast will recognize is Polygon – a platform aiming to create a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem compatible with Ethereum. Polygon, originally called Matic Network, raised funds with the help of the Binance Launchpad back in 2019. According to Defi Llama it grew into a thriving ecosystem, with around $8 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the height of the 2021 DeFi boom.
Today, there is a wide range of launchpads in the Web3 space, from platforms run by leading centralized exchanges like Binance and Bitget, to dedicated incubators and launchpads like Yield App Angel or Seedify. Every day, these launchpads are helping start-ups get off the ground with successful funding rounds. Seedify, for example, says it has helped more than 50 projects raise some $18 million in total funding and grow their market caps to five times the total amount raised.However, while launchpads can offer a crucial support network for crypto start-ups conducting a funding round, the 2018 ICO boom has also left them with a bad rep. Some were responsible for promoting pump-and-dump tokens, with an estimated 80% of all ICOs in 2017 identified as scams. 
The Importance of Due Diligence
So, while launchpads are a crucial piece of the puzzle for start-up funding, as an investor, it’s important to find one that follows strict due diligence rules to avoid fraudulent projects, since not all launchpads are made equal. If you want to make the most of the current start-up investment boom but security is your top concern, then Yield App Angel could be for you. 
With the help of its proprietary 135-point risk assessment model, Yield App expertly navigated the 2022 crypto downturn, having avoided the collapsed UST stablecoin. In fact, Yield App has seen zero hacks or exploits since its inception. You can be confident all projects available through its launchpad will adhere to the same high standards as the rest of Yield App’s portfolio. 

In the 2024 start-up investment boom, robust due diligence will be particularly crucial. With thousands of new crypto projects coming to market, it’s increasingly difficult for investors to identify the ones that will deliver the best value. Launchpads with a focus on security and risk controls will create a bridge between investors and the highest quality early-stage projects coming to market.
Yield App Angel: The Gold Standard in Fundraising
Ensuring that its users have access to the most promising ICO opportunities is at the heart of Yield App Angel. Typically, these early-stage allocations are only available to top VCs and the most privileged funds, but Yield App provides early access to retail investors with much lower minimum investments. On top of this, Yield App’s total allocations are typically much larger than other launchpads ($300,000-$4 million) and can be oversubscribed, which guarantees access to all those interested.
Recently, Yield App Angel facilitated a successful fundraising round for ME3 – a project revolutionizing fan engagement and community interaction by bringing together eSports, gaming, finance, and social connections and is currently taking subscriptions for AI project Raiinmaker.
With a wide selection of exciting fundraising rounds in the pipeline, Yield App Angel will play a pivotal role in giving the average investor access to the 2024 start-up investment boom. From gaming to AI and everything in between, Yield App seeks out curated early-stage projects that offer a real opportunity to grow your wealth and make the most of the bull market in a secure, risk-controlled way.

Analysts Expect Spot Ethereum ETFs to Launch in Weeks


Analysts anticipate the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs within weeks, following significant amendments to filings by issuers like Fidelity and Ark 21Shares.
Though US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval remains uncertain, these developments could mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market.
SEC Filings Amended, Paving Way for Potential Ethereum ETF Launch

The SEC recently requested amendments to the 19b-4 forms filed by asset managers for spot Ethereum ETFs. Five potential issuers—Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton—have complied and made the necessary changes through Cboe. They removed language related to staking and added clear statements that the funds cannot be staked by anyone.

“Neither the Trust or the Fund, nor the Sponsor, nor the Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust or Fund will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Fund’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,” the amended documents read.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) website has also featured VanEck’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF with ticker ETHV. Despite these positive developments, SEC approval is not guaranteed.

VIDEO


“Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s and then we need to see S-1 approvals,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.

The 19b-4 filings propose rule changes necessary for listing new products on stock exchanges, such as spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, S-1 registration forms provide detailed information about new securities offered to the public, including the fund’s structure, management, and investment strategy. Issuers must obtain approval for both forms to launch ETFs in the market officially.
Nonetheless, Seyffart expressed optimism after seeing this progress. He stated it “could be weeks or more before [Ethereum] ETFs launch.” Despite his optimism, Seyffart affirmed that his approval odds are still the same, at 75%.
Many see the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs as a bullish signal for the broader crypto market. However, approving these ETFs without allowing staking might disadvantage investors seeking additional yield from staking rewards.
Investors who buy, hold, and stake ETH can earn staking rewards, which provide extra yield. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs without staking provide exposure to ETH prices but lack the benefits of staking rewards.

According to a recent report, the same reason led asset managers CoinShares and Valkyrie to decide not to apply for spot Ethereum ETFs. A source familiar with the matter said that the firms don’t see value for investors without the staking aspect.
Industry experts believe that political considerations could influence the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This is especially relevant to the upcoming US presidential election in November. BeInCrypto reported that several experts agree the approval might signal a shift in President Joe Biden’s administration’s stance on crypto.

Recently, Emilie Choi, President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Coinbase, also noticed the swift change in SEC’s stance.

“And the sense is that the tone from the SEC has just changed literally overnight based on some feedback, it must have gotten from just seeing the [Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121] SAB 121 repeal and probably the administration seeing sensing some panic, I guess,” Choi said during the JPMorgan Technology, Media & Communications Conference 2024.

VanEck's Fund Listed on DTCC, Approval Anticipated


							

VanEck’s Ethereum ETF takes a step forward, but full launch awaits SEC approval.



BlackRock, Fidelity, and others also in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF.



SEC’s recent move sparks optimism for potential approval of Ethereum ETFs.




Investment management giant VanEck saw its spot Ethereum ETF make its way onto the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) list of ETFs.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure company renowned for providing post-trade clearance, settlement, custody, and information services, confirmed the addition on its website.



Crucially, listing the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is a preliminary step and does not indicate the full launch of the fund. The ETF is still awaiting regulatory approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other similar filings from industry heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.



Furthermore, under the create/redeem column, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF is marked as “N,” suggesting that it is not yet active. The DTCC noted:




“This file includes both active ETFs that may be processed at DTCC and ETFs that are not yet active (“pre-launch”) and, therefore, are not able to be processed at DTCC, unless and until such securities have received all necessary regulatory and other approvals.”




The SEC-registered securities clearing corporation has listed VanEck’s spot Ethereum fund ticker as “ETHV.” 









Earlier this week, reports emerged that the SEC requested US firms to update and refile their 19B-4 filings concerning their proposed spot Ethereum ETFs. This move has been interpreted by some as a positive signal, potentially indicating forthcoming approval from the regulator. The 19B-4 forms are essential documents that notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and require the agency’s approval before spot Ethereum ETFs can become effective. According to analysts, the regulator might approve 19B-4s but take its time greenlighting the S-1 filings.

Bitget celebrates il Bitcoin pizza day con oltre 20 Eventi Globali

To celebrate Bitcoin pizza day, Bitget, one of the main cryptocurrency exchanges, organized over 20 offline events worldwide. These meetings, held from May 19 to 22, brought together cryptocurrency enthusiasts on five continents to commemorate a crucial moment in the history of Bitcoin.

The origin of Bitcoin pizza day
Bitcoin Pizza Day, celebrated annually on May 22, marks the date of the first transaction with BTC made for a purchase in the “real” world. 
In 2010, in fact, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, which today would have a value of about 270 million dollars! 
This transaction has demonstrated the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, transforming it from an innovative idea to a revolutionary financial asset.

The global celebrations of Bitget for Bitcoin pizza day
“`
Le celebrazioni di Bitget, per commemorare questa data storica, sono state ampie ed hanno coperto città importanti come Brisbane, Buenos Aires, San Paolo e Taipei. 
A Taipei, l’evento ha visto la partecipazione di Steve Chen, co-fondatore di YouTube. 
In Australia, the evento è stato organizzato in collaborazione con l’Australian DeFi Association e la comunità All Things Blockchain. Le attività includevano sessioni di networking, condivisione di pizze, discussioni sulla blockchain e approfondimenti da parte di Bitget.
A San Paolo, Bitget ha invece collaborato con Domino’s Pizza per fornire pizze no stop all’evento, mentre a Buenos Aires è stato organizzato un evento di trading. 
These occasions therefore never turn out to be just simple celebrations, but also platforms to discuss the current landscape of blockchain technology and trading opportunities.
Beyond the celebrations: rewards and innovations
To make the celebrations more engaging, Bitget has offered exciting rewards. The company has created a 3D video to spread the message and has announced an APR of 100% in USDT for new users on Bitget Earn until June 16. 
These initiatives underline Bitget’s commitment to enhancing user engagement and promoting the adoption of criptovalute.

Reflections on the journey of Bitcoin
“`
Il Bitcoin Pizza Day non è solo una semplice celebrazione, il Pizza Day è un grande e forte reminder per tutta la comunità crypto.
The pizza Day is one of those dates that force us to stop and reflect on the enormous opportunity that cryptocurrencies still offer us today.
It forces us to take an important zoom out of the situation, becoming aware of the fact that investments in crypto remain the most profitable and advantageous investments of the last decade. 
Despite their volatility, despite the regulatory uncertainty in some of their aspects, there are absolutely no rivals. 
Despite the skepticism and sporadic bugs of the system, crypto, to date, has no competitor in terms of economic return.  
With the Pizza day, therefore, the early adopters are honored and continuous innovation in the sector is encouraged.

“Demonstrating President Trump’s success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we are proud to offer you the opportunity to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrencies.”
The logos of Bitcoin, XRP by Ripple, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Solana, SHIB, and Cardano are visible on the page.
Trump had promised to accept donations in cryptocurrencies during a speech given earlier this month, emphasizing l’importanza delle criptovalute in this year’s presidential race.
In fact, in a statement about the move, it reads: 
“This addition to the already revolutionary digital fundraising operation of President Trump marks the first time that a presidential candidate from a major party has embraced cryptocurrency for donations.”
He added that Trump plans to “build a bull army of cryptocurrencies” in view of the elections on November 5, allowing supporters to contribute with cryptocurrencies.
The ex president is not the only candidate to offer this possibility. The campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that it would accept Bitcoin last May.

SEC: Uniswap ritiene insensata la regolamentazione della DeFi

According to Uniswap Labs, the attempt by the SEC to impose DeFi regulation would be weak and wrong. 
This is what they wrote yesterday in a post published on their official blog titled “The fight for DeFi continues”.

DeFi Regulation: The issue between Uniswap and the SEC
Everything originates from the Wells notice that the SEC sent to Uniswap in April.
Questo avviso informava Uniswap Labs che l’agenzia intendeva intraprendere un’azione legale contro di loro. 
According to Uniswap, the SEC claims that the Uniswap protocol is an unregistered exchange controlled by the company Uniswap Labs. 
In reality, the Uniswap protocol is decentralized, and in theory, it should not be controlled by anyone, except by the Ethereum network as a whole, and by the other networks on which it runs. 
However, the SEC also argues that Uniswap Labs acts as an unregistered financial intermediary, and that the token UNI is an investment contract.
Uniswap’s objections to these accusations are that the value represented in a specific digital file format cannot always and in every case be defined as a security, and that the SEC cannot arbitrarily extend the definitions of exchange, broker, and contracts to the point of rendering them meaningless. 
I token vengono paragonati da Uniswap a formati di file, mentre il protocollo viene definito come un programma informatico di uso generale che chiunque può utilizzare e integrare. 
Furthermore, it emphasizes that the hundreds of thousands of users who received UNI tokens for their participation, in the early days, received the token for free, without any contract and without any specific expectation of profit. 
The response of Uniswap Labs to the SEC’s note on DeFi regulation
Uniswap Labs has already sent the SEC a comprehensive legal response to their Wells notice, and in yesterday’s post, it summarized its position for easier understanding.
First of all, they state that they believe the SEC should embrace open source technology, instead of stopping it. In this regard, they also mock the agency, highlighting how its goal should be to “protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.” 
Instead, their aggressive theories are defined as an effort to expand the jurisdiction of the SEC beyond the exchanges, to communication technology and all markets. 
A tal proposito sottolineano come le loro argomentazioni legali siano talmente deboli da essere già addirittura state confutate dai tribunali. Sottolineano anche che la Camera statunitense potrebbe approvare un disegno di legge che conferirebbe alla CFTC, e non alla SEC, l’autorità per vigilare sul trading di asset digitali.
They believe they are on the right side of history, and they invite the SEC not to dedicate its taxpayer-funded resources to initiate a lawsuit against them.
In the event that the case goes to court, they claim to be ready to fight, having on their side lawyers like Andrew Ceresney, former head of SEC enforcement who has already represented Ripple in the victory against the agency, and Don Verrilli, former United States Solicitor General who represented Grayscale in its bull case won against the agency.
The Uniswap protocol 
Regarding the Uniswap protocol developed by them, they believe it represents an important innovation in the markets, and that it benefits the consumers directly. 
It is an autonomous software that allows users to carry out transactions directly with each other, without intermediaries, without having to pay fees or rely on centralized intermediaries. 
Moreover, this protocol can actually be integrated by anyone with an Internet connection, even without relying on anyone else, not even Uniswap Labs. 
They write: 
“It just works. It has supported a trading volume of 2 trillion dollars without a single hack and has been integrated by thousands of teams and copied thousands of times”.
They also emphasize that many traditional markets are actually neither efficient nor transparent, in addition to the fact that they operate on limited days and hours, sometimes with delays of several days, requiring various intermediaries who charge commissions that increase costs for all users. 
Uniswap invece ha transazioni trasparenti che possono essere verificate da chiunque, la liquidazione è immediata, ed il servizio è disponibile in tutto il mondo 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7. 
They add:
“These properties offer individuals an unprecedented authority to control what they own and create value on the Internet in new ways”.
SEC defeated?
In recent years the SEC has been defeated twice in court by crypto companies. 
First from Ripple, which managed to convince a judge that XRP should not be considered as an unregistered security when traded on the secondary market (the exchanges). 
Following Grayscale, which managed to convince a judge that the SEC’s opposition to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was wrong, after the same agency had instead approved futures ETFs on Bitcoin. 
Apparently, this week the SEC might be defeated for the third time by the crypto sector, as it seems to be intending to approve the spot Ethereum ETFs, despite claiming that ETH should be considered an unregistered security.
It has always been quite clear that the SEC’s fight against the crypto sector was also a purely political initiative by a part of the United States Democratic Party, around which the current head of the agency Gary Gensler orbits, and given that in November they seriously risk losing the elections, they might have decided on a change of course to avoid losing the crypto electorate. 
The vittima sacrificale at this point should be the same Gary Gensler, on whom the democrats might end up placing the entire responsibility for this failure to try to come out clean in this election year.

Uniswap Slams SEC's Wells Notice, Calls Out ‘Weak’ Arguments


                        
                            Uniswap Fires Back at SEC’s Wells Notice, Calls Out ‘Weak’ Legal Arguments

                        Uniswap Labs filed a 40-page response on Tuesday to the SEC’s Wells Notice, arguing against a potential lawsuit and urging the agency to drop the matter.It comes after the agency raised concerns a few weeks ago that Uniswap’s operations might violate US securities laws. The decentralized crypto exchange is now explaining in detail why the SEC could be wrong.Uniswap serves as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform catering to developers, traders, and liquidity providers. But the SEC claimed that Uniswap Protocol operates as an unregistered securities exchange under Uniswap Labs’ control, while labeling the Uniswap interface as an unregistered securities broker-dealer, and the UNI token as an investment contract.SEC Should Not Waste Taxpayer Money on This Case: Uniswap
Uniswap hit back, stating that the SEC’s legal assertions are “weak” and have been contradicted by court rulings.The crypto marketplace argued that the agency is stretching the definitions of securities, exchanges, and contracts to an unreasonable point. It also said the SEC’s accusations hinge on the idea that any value stored in a digital format can be considered a security.“We’re confident that our work is on the right side of history,” Uniswap said. “The SEC should not devote its taxpayer-funded resources to bringing a case against us.”Most Users Outside SEC’s Jurisdiction, Uniswap Claims
Uniswap argued that most trading on its platform doesn’t involve securities, even by the SEC’s own standards. It pointed out that a large portion (65%) of its trading volume involves assets the SEC itself has admitted aren’t securities, like Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, and stablecoins.Additionally, the protocol argued that US securities laws wouldn’t apply to most users since it estimate 75% of them are from outside the US.The marketplace said that even if a few security-like transactions took place on its platform, it isn’t a securities exchange. It said a court wouldn’t see it that way because the platform wasn’t built specifically for those transactions.The federal regulator has aggressively sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, and settled with numerous crypto companies. Its focus is shifting towards Ethereum and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) players, with ShapeShift, TradeStation, Uniswap, Consensys all facing legal action. The Ethereum Foundation is also reportedly under investigation.

                        BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated significant traction, accounting for 95% of the total inflow into United States spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday.The combined inflows for these ETFs surpassed $300 million, a substantial boost for the market.Preliminary data from Farside Investors reveals that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) witnessed a substantial inflow of $290 million on May 21. When considering all eleven ETF issuers combined, the net inflow amounted to $305.7 million.Notably, this marks a reversal in the trend of zero or minimal inflows observed over the past six weeks.BlackRock’s ETF Sees Uptick in Inflows
The recent influx of funds into BlackRock’s ETF represents the highest level since April 5, eclipsing the cumulative inflows witnessed over the past 21 trading days.In the context of a volatile Bitcoin rally, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced over $1 billion in inflows during the past four trading days.Taking into account the latest daily figures, BlackRock’s IBIT has accumulated a total of $16 billion in inflows since its launch, as reported by Farside Investors.However, the official website for the product displays assets under management (AUM) of $19 billion.This positions BlackRock’s IBIT in close proximity to industry leader Grayscale, whose GBTC spot ETF boasts $20 billion in AUM, according to official records.Conversely, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded zero inflows on May 21, extending the streak of five consecutive trading days without outflows.Within the past five days, the fund has witnessed inflows of $72.5 billion, marking a reversal from a four-month trend characterized by consistent outflows.VanEck’s ETF Sees Outflows
Meanwhile, the significant inflow figure on Tuesday was not without its share of outflows.The VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF (HODL) experienced an outflow of $5.9 million, while the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw an outflow of $4.2 million.The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) observed a minor inflow of $25.8 million, while the remaining ETFs reported no significant changes.The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs has been fueled by a recent uptick in BTC prices, with the asset gaining 12% over the past week.On May 21, BTC reached a six-week high of $71,600, but it subsequently dipped below the $70,000 level during early trading on May 22, currently trading at $69,444 at the time of writing.As reported, Bitcoin has achieved all-time highs against local currencies in several countries across Asia and South America.Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading at $69,000, just $3,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.

Biden campaign in panic mode as Trump accepts crypto donations


    Not long after declaring his support for the cryptocurrency sector and making it one of the defining points of his presidential bid, the former United States President Donald Trump is now officially accepting donations for his campaign in the form of crypto assets, creating concerns for his opponent’s team.



Specifically, in a historic decision, the Trump campaign has announced it would start accepting donations in digital assets and has launched a fundraising page allowing them, making the former President the first major party nominee in the US to do this, according to a press release on May 21.

As per the press release, the fundraising page provides “any federally permissible donor the ability to give – through its joint fundraising committees – using any cryptocurrency accepted through the Coinbase Commerce product,” referring to the popular crypto exchange.







Indeed, the presidential hopeful’s campaign is now accepting a range of popular assets from the crypto sector, including the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), as well as altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and stablecoin USD Coin (USDC). 



Trump vs. Biden crypto issue



Furthermore, the announcement reads that this makes Trump different from his rival, the incumbent US President Joe Biden, “and his official surrogate Elizabeth Warren,” the Democrat Senator from Massachusetts, as the former president “has reduced regulations and championed innovation in financial technology.”




“The effort to reduce the control of government on an American’s financial decision-making is part of a seismic shift toward freedom. Today’s announcement reflects President Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.”




On the other hand, Trump’s campaign argues that his opponents “believe only government has the answers to how our nation leads the world,” also addressing Warren’s March 2023 reelection ad, accusing her of “building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices.”



Biden campaign in panic mode



Meanwhile, Biden’s team has sent a fundraising text warning donors that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump,” around the same time as the Trump campaign made the above announcement, according to a widely circulated screenshot.

As a reminder, Trump recently said he was “fine with crypto,” that he was planning to reduce regulatory “hostility” towards it and keep crypto businesses in America, as well as making it possible for his supporters to donate to his campaign using crypto assets, as Finbold reported on May 9.

PEPE Price Hits New ATH: Could Massive Corrections Follow?


PEPE’s price continued to please its holders, as the meme coin not only led the rallying altcoins but also marked a new all-time high in the last 24 hours.
However, this could trigger the altcoin observing a decline as investors look primed to sell.
PEPE Investors Close to Selling

Following the PEPE price rise, the meme coin looks prepared to see some major selling as the altcoin investors realize massive profits. According to the Network Realized Profit/Loss indicator, the overall gains have been inclining for the past month.
Realized profits are a sign that the investors are selling, and this could now intensify as the meme coin hits a new ATH. This seems to have saturated the bullishness and may lead to heavy selling.

Secondly, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio also hints at profit-taking. The MVRV ratio monitors investor profits and losses. With PEPE’s 30-day MVRV at 38%, indicating profit, selling may ensue. 

Historically, the meme coin has undergone corrections at MVRV levels of 15% to 36%, marking it as a danger zone. PEPE is already above this level, which signifies stronger profit-taking potential.

Should this happen, the altcoin could note a fall below key support.
PEPE Price Prediction: Awaiting a Dip
PEPE price market the new ATH of $0.00001430 after rising by 51% in the last two days. At the time of writing, the altcoin is not exhibiting any signs of a decline, but considering the above indicators, it could occur soon.

The most likely outcome would be a fall to $0.00001251, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement. Intense selling could extend this decline and PEPE could dip to the 61.8% Fib line at $0.00001146.
This line is known to be a bull market support floor, so losing it would wipe away a chunk of the recent profits.

But if PEPE bounces off this support floor, the meme coin could have a shot at reinitiating recovery. The same happened in mid-May before the altcoin jumped, which could invalidate the bearish thesis.

Milady Maker leads daily NFT sales, CryptoPunks records 5 transactions despite backlash


Milady Maker led CryptoSlam’s daily non-fungible token (NFT) sales chart on Tuesday with US$1.07 million, up from Monday’s US$267,554.



Milady’s Tuesday surge follows backlash against Yuga Labs, the owner of the CryptoPunks IP. The company faced criticism for announcing on Monday a new NFT collection focusing on race and gender, tied to CryptoPunks, the day’s second-ranking collection.



While disappointed CryptoPunks owners warned they might sell their NFTs, members of the Milady community predicted that the funds would flow into Milady.







CryptoSlam data shows that many CryptoPunk owners moved their assets. It ranked second on the day with US$737,526 in sales, although it only recorded five sales transactions on Tuesday. Additionally, it also recorded 14 transfers.

	
	
	
	


On Monday, the collection had 30 total transfers, which is the highest since late March.



Following closely in third place, DMarket recorded a daily sales volume of US$735,546, with 3,680 unique buyers and sellers at 3,230, contributing to 28,835 total transactions.



Other notable collections include Fantasy Top and The Captainz, ranking fourth and fifth respectively. 



Fantasy Top achieved a daily sales volume of US$652,892 with 1,726 unique buyers, while The Captainz garnered US$618,594 with 33 unique buyers.

	
	
	

	


The Ethereum blockchain, where Milady, CryptoPunks and Captainz reside, led all blockchains with US$8.47 million in NFT sales, rising from the previous day’s US$6.09 million, a 39% jump.



In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain reported a daily sales volume of US$5.85 million with 1,798 unique buyers, an increase from the previous day’s US$4.97 million. 



Polygon and Mythos Chain also reported substantial daily sales of US$1.60 million and US$758,947.38, respectively, highlighting the diverse and active nature of the NFT market across various blockchains.

Ether ETF Frenzy: Memecoins Explode, Investors Eye SEC Decision


							

Fate of spot Ether ETFs uncertain as deadline nears, VanEck’s proposal leads.



Memecoins Pepe and Floki Inu prices surge amid speculation of regulatory approval for Ether ETFs



SEC actions hint at potential green light for Ether ETFs, impacting broader crypto market




As the May 23 deadline for the first proposed spot Ether ETF approaches, the fate of such financial products hangs in the balance. Notably, VanEck’s proposal leads the pack, and despite the uncertainty, recent actions by issuers suggest they are preparing for a potential green light from regulators.



Notably, Ethereum-based memecoins have experienced a substantial price surge alongside ETH tokens amid growing speculation that regulators may be softening their stance on spot ETH ETFs.



Reports that the SEC has asked at least three U.S. firms to revise their applications for listing spot Ether ETFs have further fueled the bullish interest in these memecoins.



Pepe (PEPE) led the rally, rising 29% in the past 24 hours, as per the data from CoinMarketCap, while LADYS surged approximately 25%. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a small gain of 3%, while Ether (ETH) itself increased by around 4%, reaching $3,792.



Additionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) also ticked up about 4.5%, while Floki Inu (FLOKI) prices shot up by 14%. Moreover, Ethereum rollup network Mantle (MNT) saw a price surge of 6%.



 
 




The market’s positive reaction underscores the high stakes and potential impact of spot Ether ETF approvals. Investors are closely watching the SEC’s decisions, as approval could significantly boost the broader cryptocurrency market by legitimizing and expanding access to Ethereum-based investments.

Ripple CTO Falls Victim to "Sophisticated" Phishing Scam


David Schwartz, chief executive officer at Ripple, recently fell victim to a "sophisticated" phishing scam, according to his recent social media post. Schwartz claims the scam involved opening a support case with Apple. The fraudsters then leveraged real Apple emails and web pages in their SMS messages. The SMS messages were sent to the Ripple executive in order to trick him into giving control over his Apple ID. They were likely able to open a support case with just his email address. "Presumably, Apple wouldn't have given them access. What's clever is using the (real) case to make their (fake) SMS messages convincing," he said.cardThe bad actors somehow managed to obtain Schwartz's email address and phone number. "I'm now sure exactly how they got that, but they're not great secrets," he added. However, Schwartz was not tricked by scammers because their SMS messages had "terrible grammar."Ripple teams up with Facebook to fight scams The latest incident coincided with Ripple launching a new anti-scam initiative in collaboration with tech giant Meta and various cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase. "There’s one thing all of us in tech can agree on – it’s high time we dismantled the scammers once and for all," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in his social media post.

Is Bitcoin at risk from Ethereum ETFs? Peter Schiff explains - AMBCrypto



Schiff’s remarks come amid Bitcoin’s brief move above $70k.
Bitcoin spot ETFs attract significant institutional investment despite the concerns.

As the world awaits the approval of an Ethereum [ETH] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), prominent Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has taken the opportunity to attack Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Schiff sees an upcoming bearish trend for BTC 
In a 21st May post on X (formerly Twitter), Schiff suggested that Bitcoin could become bearish if the Ethereum spot ETF is approved. He said, 
“#Bitcoin gained renewed strength from rumors that an #Ethereum ETF will likely be approved. But any money to buy new Ether ETFs will most likely come from existing Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who decided to make an allocation to #crypto won’t increase that allocation to buy Ether.”
Schiff highlighted that although the recent rumors about an Ethereum ETF approval have boosted Bitcoin’s value temporarily, things could turn out differently.
He believes that the funds for these new Ethereum ETFs will likely come from the money currently invested in existing Bitcoin ETFs.
In his view, investors who have already allocated funds to cryptocurrency are unlikely to increase their overall investment in the crypto market just to buy Ethereum ETFs. 
Instead, they might shift their investments from Bitcoin to Ethereum, which could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price.
Should you trust Schiff’s remarks? 
Needless to say, Schiff’s remarks sparked a lot of criticism, starting with Rajat Soni, a Bitcoin educator, who claimed, 
“Peter… Bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up because of Ether. Ether’s price goes up because of Bitcoin. If you don’t understand this, your opinion is irrelevant.”
However, Santiment’s latest tweet echoed Schiff’s remarks. 
“#Ethereum is seeing the most #bullish crowd sentiment since September with the #SEC likely to approve the first #ETF’s, and $ETH’s price surge. Meanwhile, #Bitcoin & #Solana sentiment is slightly #bearish.”

 Bitcoin ETFs see massive inflows 
Despite the criticism and uncertainty, Bitcoin spot ETFs have remained a favorite among institutions. On 21st May, Bitcoin ETFs experienced net inflows totaling $305.7 million.
 Leading the pack was BlackRock with an investment of $290.0 million, followed by Fidelity with $25.8 million. Bitwise and VanEck, however, saw outflows of $4.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, with its price climbing nearly 13% over the past week and a half to return to the $70,000 mark per BTC. This rally has prompted market analysts and traders to reassess their strategies as Bitcoin inches closer to its all-time high of $74,000. However, despite the bullish sentiment, renowned trader John Bollinger, the creator of the widely used Bollinger Bands, has expressed caution regarding the immediate future of the major cryptocurrency.Bollinger Bands are a popular indicator among traders that help identify volatility and potential price reversals by plotting standard deviations above and below a simple moving average. Recently, Bollinger noted a concerning pattern on Bitcoin’s price chart, indicating a potential pullback or consolidation period. He highlighted the appearance of a two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band, which often suggests a temporary market correction. Although the analysis suggests a short-term concern, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects. His cautious stance is rooted in technical indicators rather than a fundamental bearish outlook. Bollinger’s perspective reflects current market sentiment, where optimism about Bitcoin's future growth is tempered by awareness of potential short-term volatility.Optimism and cautionThe recent price movement and Bollinger’s analysis come at a critical time for Bitcoin, as it is trading just 6% below its peak price.

Massive XRP Rally Expected With Federal Reserve's $6 Trillion Inflation Shift


								Could the US Federal Reserve’s potential pivot on inflation be the catalyst for a multi-trillion dollar surge in the cryptocurrency market? That’s the bullish prediction from some of Wall Street’s top analysts as they eye a seismic shift in monetary policy.

According to a new report from Forbes, the stage may be set for a remarkable resurgence in the prices of leading digital assets like Bitcoin and XRP. The key driver? An estimated $6 trillion in sidelined capital that could come flooding back into the market as the Fed eases its hawkish stance.
The Floodgates Could Open
This isn’t just a typical crypto rally. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, believes in the potential for a transformative, once-in-a-generation event. If the Fed signals that it’s successfully reined in inflation, he said people could see trillions of dollars rushing back into the market in a matter of months.


Lee’s bullish outlook is centered around the notion that the Fed will soon declare victory in its battle against soaring prices. The recent deceleration in the US consumer price index, with a 0.3% increase in April versus 0.4% in March, suggests the central bank’s aggressive rate hike campaign may be bearing fruit.
Should that prove to be the case, Lee believes it could ignite a frenzy of investment activity, with Bitcoin potentially surging to $150,000 – more than double its current price of around $71,000. And if history is any guide, other cryptocurrencies like XRP could follow a similar trajectory.
XRP is currently trading at 0.53. Chart: TradingView
Crypto ETFs Provide Institutional Tailwind
Bolstering this bullish case is the recent wave of crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals, which have opened the door for mainstream investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Since January, a number of high-profile Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have launched, providing a crucial on-ramp for institutional capital.
XRP Poised For Resurgence?
All eyes will be on XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which has struggled to regain its former highs after a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, if the broader crypto market does indeed embark on a parabolic rally fueled by that $6 trillion in dormant capital, analysts believe XRP could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Some are even speculating that the token could soar past the $1 mark – and potentially reach even loftier heights – if Bitcoin achieves Lee’s $150,000 target.

XRP has been in the doldrums for a while now, but that could all change in a heartbeat if this predicted crypto boom materializes. With the SEC issue seemingly resolved, XRP is poised for a major resurgence, and we could see it reclaim its former glory as one of the market’s top-performing assets.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Paints Problematic Picture

Shiba Inu has shown us that it has the potential to break through after the 10% surge and a move above the 50 EMA threshold. However, despite the recovery, numerous data points show that it is not enough, especially as we see no continuation at the current point in time.The recent price chart indicates that while SHIB managed to surge past the 50 EMA, it struggled to maintain momentum. The volume spikes accompanying the price surge were notable, suggesting increased trading activity. However, these spikes did not sustain, reflecting a lack of consistent buying pressure necessary for a sustained breakout.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn-chain signals present a mixed picture. Net network growth and the percentage of addresses in profit ("In the Money") are both showing bullish trends, indicating some positive sentiment and network activity. However, the concentration metric is slightly bearish, suggesting that the asset might still be under the influence of a few large holders, which could lead to price manipulation or sudden sell-offs.Exchange signals offer a slightly more optimistic view. The smart price metric and bid-ask volume imbalance both lean bullish, indicating that on-exchange trading activity is currently favorable. The bid-ask volume imbalance, in particular, shows a significant 6.69% bullish tilt, which could imply a strong demand at current price levels.Despite these positive indicators, the lack of follow-through in price action and the bearish concentration signal highlight the challenges SHIB faces. For a more decisive bullish breakout, SHIB would need to overcome the 200 EMA resistance and attract sustained buying interest. Broader market conditions will also play a crucial role in determining whether SHIB can capitalize on its recent momentum.

Bitcoin Holders Resume Buying After Market Sell-Off


The basic laws of supply and demand determine the price action of any asset, including Bitcoin. When supply exceeds demand, the asset’s price tends to decline. Conversely, when demand outstrips supply, the price usually rises. 
These same principles apply to cryptocurrencies, and on-chain metrics can provide valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ behavior.
The Impact of Heightened Profit-Taking
When analyzing a Bitcoin bull market over the long term, the price movement typically exhibits significant upward volatility, mixed with periods of corrections and consolidation. Most investors know that financial markets do not consistently rise, leading to a dynamic interplay between supply and demand, resulting in periodic corrections.
This trend is evident when observing Bitcoin’s Realized Cap and Realized Profits.

Realized Cap: This adds up the value of all BTC based on the price when they were last moved, giving a clearer picture of the money truly invested in Bitcoin.
Realized Profits: This refers to the actual gains that BTC holders have made when they sell their Bitcoin for more than they paid.

As Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of over $73,000 in mid-March, its Realized Cap also increased, suggesting that most long-term holders were profitable. Consequently, some exited their positions, resulting in a significant spike in Realized Profits.

The rising supply of BTC on the market surpassed the demand levels, leading to a corrective phase that saw the price of Bitcoin dip below $57,000. This drop brought Bitcoin below its Short-Term Holder Realized Price, creating a sense of fear in the market, given that short-term holders are more prone to sell based on price volatility.


Realized Price: The average price at which all BTC were last bought. It is like finding out the average cost everyone paid for their BTC.
Short-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have moved around in the last 155 days. These BTC are the ones most likely to be spent or sold soon.
Long-Term Holder Realized Price: The average price investors paid for BTC that they have not moved in over 155 days. These BTC are the least likely to be spent or sold soon.

The Short-Term Holder Realized Price, which currently stands at $60,500, served as an accumulation point despite investors’ fears. Indeed, long-term holders felt comfortable adding more BTC to their positions at this level after realizing profits in March.

Bitcoin Supply-Demand Trends Shift
Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change provides a glimpse into this behavior. After undergoing a prolonged distribution period, long-term holders have begun accumulating again, having amassed more than 70,000 BTC since early May.

Long-Term Holder Net Position Change: It shows how the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors increases or decreases over time.

Based on the simple laws of supply and demand, as demand for Bitcoin begins to outstrip the available supply of BTC in the market, the odds of Bitcoin resuming its upward trajectory improve.
Bitcoin Holder Net Position Change. Source: Glassnode
Observing Bitcoin’s Balance on Exchanges can corroborate these supply and demand dynamics.

Balance on Exchanges: This refers to the total amount of Bitcoin held in cryptocurrency exchange wallets.


Since early May, more than 30,000 BTC have moved to private cryptocurrency wallets for long-term holding, showing confidence among holders in Bitcoin’s future value.
Bitcoin Balance on Exchanges. Source: Glassnode
While assessing the future price action of any asset can be challenging, multiple on-chain metrics can hint at potential price points investors should pay attention to. One of these metrics is the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, which determines whether the price of Bitcoin is unusually high or low based on its historical averages.

MVRV: It stands for Market Value to Realized Value. Market Value is the current price of Bitcoin times the number of BTC in circulation, while Realized Value is the average price at which all BTC were last bought.
Pricing Bands: These bands show the upper and lower limits of Bitcoin’s price based on its historical MVRV values to help identify when Bitcoin is either extremely overvalued or undervalued based on historical price data.

Bitcoin recently moved back above the +0.5σ pricing band, which currently stands at $64,600. Historically, such an upswing has led Bitcoin to test the 1.0σ pricing band supported by rising demand. This pricing band is currently hovering around $77,000.

Summary and Conclusions
The basic laws of supply and demand dictate Bitcoin’s price movements. Indeed, prices fall when supply exceeds demand and rise when demand exceeds supply. On-chain metrics offer valuable insights into these dynamics, allowing analysts to understand Bitcoin holders’ behavior.
Recent data reveals a price decline below $57,000 as supply increased. However, long-term holders have demonstrated confidence by accumulating over 70,000 BTC since early May. This trend suggests resilience in the market despite short-term volatility.

Key metrics like Realized Cap and Realized Profits illustrate that many long-term holders were profitable at Bitcoin’s recent all-time high, leading to a wave of selling and subsequent price corrections. However, the accumulation by long-term holders at lower prices indicates a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s future value.

Overall, these on-chain metrics help identify shifts in supply and demand, providing a framework to understand Bitcoin’s price action and investor behavior and indicating potential upward trends as demand begins to outstrip supply.

Donald Trump Accepts Crypto Donations Via Coinbase Commerce Product


							

Trump champions cryptocurrency, promising to build a “crypto army” and criticizing Biden’s stance on digital assets.



Trump targets Senator Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto efforts, highlighting a Democratic crackdown on cryptocurrencies.



The campaign criticizes President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren for their efforts to form an anti-crypto army.  




Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election, has promised to build a “crypto army” and announced the acceptance of cryptocurrency donations. During his presidential campaign event on Tuesday, Trump declared his support for cryptocurrency, criticizing President Joe Biden’s alleged “socialist government control” over digital assets



Previously, Trump emphasized the urgency of introducing a convenient and comprehensive regulatory framework. In addition, he questioned Biden and his administration’s anti-crypto stance. Trump asserted that Biden opposes crypto assets without understanding them.



In his recent campaign, Trump criticized US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a notable crypto critic, referring to her effort to build an “anti-crypto army.” By highlighting Warren and Biden in the same context, Trump pointed out the Democrats’ combat against cryptocurrencies. He stated, “Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices.”



The Trump campaign’s crypto donations enable the candidate’s followers to donate any cryptocurrencies through the Coinbase Commerce product. Coinbase spokeswoman Julia Krieger commented,




 “Crypto is nonpartisan and moves money forward because its cheaper and faster. The Coinbase platform is open to all candidates this election season.” 




The campaign added that the limit in contribution and other requirements will be per the regulations of the Federal Election Commission. Denouncing Biden’s anti-crypto army, the campaign cited, “MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!” 









With the Trump campaign’s announcement to accept crypto donations, Donald Trump has become the “first major party nominee” to embrace crypto donations. Meanwhile, Biden warned his supporters, stating, “Cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.”

Bitcoin buy calls surge: Here's what it means for your portfolio - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin has seen a rally in buy calls on social media.
However, the coin remains at risk of a correction in the short term.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] social activity has seen a significant uptick as the cryptocurrency market anticipates the approval of the spot Ethereum [ETH] Exchange-Traded Fund [ETF].
In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment noted that the surging social media discussions about the leading cryptocurrency asset have been mostly positive, with the market making more buy calls than sell calls.
When an asset sees a surge in buy calls among its traders on social media, they are expressing positive sentiment about the asset’s continued price growth. Some traders even consider it a good entry point, perceiving prices as low and due for an upswing. 
BTC holders must look before the leap
While this may offer a good entry opportunity for some, “paper hands” have been known to sell when an asset’s social activity increases like this.
This is because the surge in BTC buy calls among its traders is often due to speculation and not backed by a corresponding demand for the coin. Therefore, newer investors who need more conviction in the coin’s long-term potential might be hesitant to hold during these periods even with positive social sentiment.
Also, short-term traders often see the surge in buy calls as an opportunity to profit. Hence, a temporary sell-off is possible even amidst overall bullish sentiment.
Moreover, BTC’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio returned a high value of 153.19% at press time. The metric tracks the ratio between the coin’s current market price and the average price of each acquired token. 
Source: Santiment
When it surges in this manner, the asset is said to be overvalued, and on average, coin holders are sitting on profits. This may lead to a spike in selling pressure as investors are more likely to take profits when the potential return is high.
The rise in BTC’s funding rates also heightens the likelihood of a short-term correction in its price. On 21st May, the coin’s funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges was 0.018%, its highest level in a month, according to Coinglass’ data.

Generally, when an asset’s futures funding rate rallies, it is a bullish signal, suggesting a strong demand for long positions. 
However, when it gets too high and becomes unsustainable, it may result in forced selling by leveraged long positions. This may trigger price swings and result in unexpected price drops.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Declares 'Corruption Era' Amid New Evidence


								Pro-XRP lawyer and Republican Party candidate for the Senate Massachusetts, John E. Deaton voiced severe criticisms of what he described as pervasive corruption within federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve (Fed). Deaton, through a post on social media platform X, outlined a grim view of institutional integrity in the United States, coining it the “THE CORRUPTION ERA.”
Why The Pro-XRP Lawyer Is Outraged
“As I’ve said multiple times, we are living through a period of time history books will later describe as: ‘THE CORRUPTION ERA,'” Deaton asserted. He expressed particular disdain for the ‘revolving door’ practice, where federal regulators move into high positions within industries they previously supervised. “The revolving door existing within these agencies must be closed once and for all,” the lawyer who represented 75,000 XRP holders in the Ripple vs. SEC case emphasized.
Deaton announced his intent to propose and support legislation that would enforce a five-year ban preventing federal regulators from transitioning directly into the industries they once regulated. “A person should not be able to leave the FDA and then immediately go work for Pfizer,” Deaton explained, highlighting the urgent need for such reforms to dismantle the entrenched networks of influence and self-interest within government bodies.

The conversation around these concerns stemmed from a statement from Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank. Today, Long expressed shock over perceived preferential treatment by the Federal Reserve towards another institution, only weeks after a federal judge has rejected Custodia Bank’s application for a Fed master account and membership with the Fed.
Her outrage followed the surprising approval of a master account to Numisma, a Connecticut-based fintech bank formerly known as Currency Reserve, which is notably not FDIC-insured nor federally regulated.
“I AM SPEECHLESS. Is this what it appears to be — special treatment by the Fed for another former insider, just weeks after the Fed’s Inspector General ‘suspended’ its investigation into the Fed’s master account practices?” Long questioned publicly via X. She highlighted the inconsistency of the Fed’s stance in the Custodia Bank case, where it previously described such regulatory structures as unsafe and unsound.
“The Fed’s Custodia denial order went into excruciating detail about why these issues are not curable, but suddenly a bank with the same regulatory structure got a pass by the Fed — and an ex-Fed governor is involved? What the ….,” she stated.

FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared the scoop: “Connecticut-based fintech bank Numisma (formerly named Currency Reserve) has received conditional approval for access to a Federal Reserve master account, making it the second non-FDIC-insured, non-federally regulated bank to receive one in recent years.”
Terrett pointed out that both banks granted such approval had direct connections to former Federal Reserve officials, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and the integrity of the approval process.
The denial of a master account to Custodia Bank is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which sees such access as vital to integrating more seamlessly into the broader US financial system. This access would enable crypto-focused banks like Custodia to offer more efficient, potentially less costly banking services by connecting directly to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems.
This ongoing situation casts a shadow over the crypto industry and further hints at an “Operation Choke Point 2.0”, an initiative by the Biden administration to stifle the crypto sector.

RNDR Token Meets Resistance as It Tries to Reclaim All-Time High


Render (RNDR) is poised to break above the upper line of an ascending triangle in continuation of its most recent uptrend.
Logging a 10% price hike in the last two days, the bulls can push above this resistance level if the current general market trend is sustained. 
Render May Face Some Difficulties 
Render’s double-digit price rally in the past 24 hours may witness a pullback as some of the token key indicators showed that bearish influence remains dominant.

At press time, the dots that make up RNDR’s Parabolic SAR indicator exceed its price. This indicator identifies potential trend direction and reversals in the token’s price.

When its dots are above an asset’s price, the market is said to be in decline. This indicates that the asset’s price has been falling and may continue to do so. Market participants interpret this as a sign to exit long positions and open short positions.
Also, the value of RNDR’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was -0.01 at the time of writing. This indicator measures money flow into and out of the RNDR market.

A bearish signal, indicating a weakening uptrend or a developing downtrend, appears when its value falls below zero
RNDR Price Prediction: Negative Sentiments Meet High MVRV Ratio
The poor sentiment currently trails RNDR is depicted in its negative weighted sentiment spotted on-chain. Subsequently, at -0.29 at press time, this metric shows a dominant negative bias in the online discourse surrounding the asset.
Render Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
This negative sentiment comes at a time when the token’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio is high. As of this writing, this was 231.78%

Render Weighted Sentiment. Source: Santiment
A high MVRV ratio already suggests a potential correction if the price becomes unsustainable. Therefore, a negative sentiment reinforces this concern, highlighting potential selling pressure that could drive the price down.
Conversely, if selling pressure gains momentum, the token may find it impossible to break above the upper line of the ascending triangle and fall toward $9.8.

However, if this bearish projection is overturned, the token’s price may exceed $12.

What was the primary vision behind creating dex.guru, and how has that vision evolved since its inception?
Evgeny: That’s a great question, especially given our recent transition to Guru Network. Many people remember us from the Dex Guru Trading Terminal days and wonder why we’ve shifted to a network model, what orchestration involves, and why AI plays a role in it.
We started as DeFi trading terminal providing a unified platform that merges real-time trading with in-depth analytics, and DeFi trading experience by offering both elements in a single, accessible interface.
That was a new concept back then when BNB was just Launched and Poligon was just getting steam. We went through the whole DeFi summer with terminal, got VC funded, and then UST,FTX and winter came, so plans for TGE were postponed, and retail volume dried out mostly we switched to B2B products lineup coming from the same backend.

Here’s our trading terminal with traders categorization and analytics.
We initially developed a block explorer and then began offering it to various blockchain networks.
The first one was Canto, and then on 18 chains. 
We began by offering B2B products to various blockchain networks and soon realized the need to enhance our offerings. This led to the development of the Guru Data Warehouse, expanding our suite of tools to better serve our clients.


At some point, we recognized that our real strength was not merely in providing a data analytics toolset but in offering a comprehensive developer’s toolkit tailored for the builders’ community. This realization led to the transformation of Guru Data Warehouse into a full-fledged development platform, which eventually evolved into what is now the Guru Network and Flow.
And that path got us all the way to the Guru Multi Chain AI Orchestration layer we are launching in following weeks.
BIC: Please give us an overview of the technology stack that powers dex.guru.
Evgeny: We started at times there were no reliable RPC providers at the market. That’s why our technology stack starts from nodes we run ourselves for all the chains we support(https://mirror.xyz/evahteev.eth/POoVA0GiX9XcaQXGwQekS7o57pWwKARYzEW4uofwX2E), then we have ETL Pipeline inherited from open-source ethereum ETL(python)  extensively developed towards DeFI needs(Prices, Pools, Dexes, Balances etc). Clickhouse DB is a core Storage of Data Warehouse, Next.js, and react applications.
BIC: Dex.guru combines trading and analytics on one platform. Can you explain how this integration benefits users compared to using separate platforms for trading and analytics?
Evgeny: That’s the concept we started with at DexGuru, where multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) were presented alongside trading options across them. Users appreciated the feeling of control and the ability to conduct their own research (DYOR) directly on the platform.
We continued to deliver in that same user-centric manner, and now we offer a data-rich Guru Warehouse analytics suite, fully integrated and embedded within the platform.
We have a new DexGuru V2 Auto coming soon. 
BIC: What are some recent innovations or developments that you’re particularly proud of?

Evgeny: As we expanded our B2B analytics products, we began tackling not just the data-reading aspects but also the execution and orchestration side of things. This led to our first implementation of Chainflow during the ETHOnline hackathon, which further evolved into Flow and, ultimately the Guru Network. 
Chainflow served as a proof of concept for the future BBPA (Blockchain Business Process Automation) Engines, which now act as the compute layer on the Guru Network – Compute Orchestration Chain.
We then implemented data-aware AI agents in our block explorers, orchestrating them in the same manner as Chainflow. The definitions are done in BPMN standard:

Process definitions are run on Guru Network Orchestration Nodes and synchronized through Inscriptions on Guru Network as they serve as inscriptions producers and indexers at the same time and can trigger events based on messages coming from other engines.

BIC: Our usual question: How do you ensure the platform’s security and reliability, especially considering the service’s decentralized nature?
Evgeny: At Dex Guru, we rely on the security mechanisms of our vendors since we function as an aggregator of aggregators. This approach allows us to leverage established, robust security protocols across different platforms to ensure the safety and reliability of our services.
For the Guru Network, particularly regarding the Process Definitions Smart Contracts we plan to deploy, we have dedicated significant time and resources to conduct thorough security audits and reviews prior to the mainnet launch.
BIC: All that Guru Network stuff looks complicated… How can a simple user get started with it?
Evgeny: That’s a good question. We are constantly working on simplifying our platform and improving the user experience at Guru Network, as well as enhancing our documentation available at https://docs.gurunetwork.ai/. 
BIC: What trends do you foresee in the decentralized space, and how is dex.guru preparing to capitalize on these trends?
Evgeny: We see the DeFi space becoming increasingly complex for users as new financial mechanisms evolve. Recognizing users’ growing demand for Web3 Automation, we are responding by delivering DexGuru V2 Auto.


These Web3 automation functions will help our users track comprehensive trends and automate their usual actions and routines, enhancing their overall efficiency and effectiveness.
BIC: How will Guru Network’s BBPA engine (Blockchain Business Process Automation) impact the future of DeFi automation? Can you share some specific examples of how it can be used to automate DeFi tasks?
Evgeny: Yes, there are some obvious trading strategy examples visible on the screenshot I provided earlier. But, besides that We envision it as a catalog where Gurus contribute snippets for trades, exit strategies, periodic routines, and other degen activities we all love.
Users can select and deploy automation snippets from the catalog, paying an instantiation fee to the Guru who developed and published the snippet.
BIC: BTW, user experience is crucial for retaining traders and analysts. What steps has dex.guru taken to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience?
Evgeny: We are planning to launch DexGuru V2, featuring a completely new interface and automations, first for a private beta within our Guru NFT Season Pass holders community and then to the public along with Guru Network Mainnet launch.
Let screenshots speak for themselves:



Plus all the automations I’ve mentioned and posted as screenshots earlier.
BIC: What about the community? How important is its involvement in the development and growth of dex.guru? 
Evgeny: We have a vibrant community of DeFi users and Guru Season Pass NFT holders.
We are planning to launch initially within our community, offering incentives for invites to the Season 2 NFT Collection and running automations from the tGuru Faucet. 




We are tentatively planning to release it in the coming weeks, prior to the TGE and LBP events scheduled for the end of May or June at the latest.
BIC: How will the Guru Network be governed? Will there be a role for token holders in decision-making?
Evgeny: So the community would be able to boost their rewards by helping us make DexGuru V2 Auto better.
We postponed provisional governance two years ago, along with the deferral of our TGE plans at that time.
But now we’re revisiting that idea and will provide a governance framework for the Guru Network in the coming months before the mainnet launch.
BIC: What can users expect from dex.guru in the next year or two? Are there any major updates or expansions on the horizon?
Evgeny: The Guru Network launch and its ecosystem expansion around the narrative of Web3/AI Orchestration, fostering innovation and integration across technologies and user flows. You can learn more about it here.

VIDEO

Those plans are pretty much covering two-year period.
BIC: Thank you! Let’s move to the questions from the Community 😈
@MEHEDIIA
The Guru Enlightenment Network (GEN) aims to bridge AI and blockchain technologies. Can you detail how GEN facilitates the orchestration of user flows and business processes across both on-chain and off-chain environments, and what real-world applications this enables?
Evgeny: Guru Flow, a key product within the Guru Network ecosystem, orchestrates user actions, Web3 transactions, data insights, and the compute layer, incorporating prediction models as needed. Real-world applications range from our Web3 Auto POC, demonstrated at https://app.web3auto.guru/, to more complex, business-oriented projects like Pixelpact (https://pixelpact.ai/), our inaugural non-Guru Ecosystem venture. 
Pixelpact focuses on the tokenization of real-world assets, specifically artworks, which are used as the basis for creating unique NFTs. These NFTs, generated through three blending models that incorporate users’ input with original art, represent the real artwork and its value at exhibition events. By minting these NFTs, attendees support artists and engage in subsequent social finance activities available to NFT holders. Those are the basic examples that are already implemented and clickable by users.


BIC: @RenaldoDowd
For those interested in joining the Guru Network community and exploring revenue opportunities, what are the steps to get involved? Where can individuals purchase tokens and sign up to participate in the project’s ecosystem?

Evgeny: We have multiple layers of network participants within our ecosystem. Gurus who contribute to the agents and AI/Web3 automations. Ecosystem projects which are utilizing the processes from catalog and flow technology as a framework for running their full stack applications in between AI, Web2, and Web3 context and retail who is looking to automate their DeFi routines and GPT tasks with the ability to pick something that works from catalog and start getting results in minutes.
We are currently working on better documentation and guides for each guru network participants audience so it would show a clear pass for participation and earning within the ecosystem.

that’s from the litepaper. 
BIC: @Anastaciaberrios63
How does DexGuru V2 (Auto) differentiate itself from traditional analytics platforms, and what features can users expect from this closed beta release?
Evgeny: On top of our traditional feature reach trading analytics Dex Guru V2 is aiming to provide new Web3 automation features. Those automation scenarios are based on reach data, synthetic indicators, and trained AI models, and executed in a non-custodial fashion in the user’s controlled environment. That gives a completely new perspective on possible DeFi activities, eliminates human errors, and makes our lives easier. On the other side community members (Gurus) who develop and publish their scripts and agents in the catalog are incentivized by instantiation and infrastructure fees share paid by users who deploy and run them.

We did POC of automation features just recently:

Bitcoin Funds Get $306 Million Boost Ahead of SEC Ethereum ETF Deadline - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSure, the spotlight has been on spot Ethereum ETF hopefuls since Monday—but the already-trading Bitcoin ETFs have gotten a boost from the excitement.Yesterday Bitcoin ETFs saw $306 million worth of funds deposited, according to Coinglass. That's the biggest single day of inflows the category of funds have seen since earlier this month.Yesterday's distribution across the Bitcoin ETFs wasn't exactly even.BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took in $290 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $26 million worth of inflows. That was offset by the Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) seeing $4 million and $6 million worth of withdrawals, respectively.And the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $72.5 million worth of net inflows between May 15 and May 20, was flat on Tuesday, according to Coinglass data.As an aside, the gap GBTC and IBIT has now shrunk to $736 million. That's approximately half what it was less than a month ago. It remains to be seen whether Grayscale's incoming CEO, Peter Mintzberg, will make any changes to the firm's flagship Bitcoin fund.But why would Bitcoin ETFs pump on anticipation for Ethereum counterparts? That could be because some analysts, like Standard Chartered bank, are predicting that an Ethereum ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission could lead both assets—BTC and ETH—to new all-time highs.The global market cap got close to matching that in mid-March, when the Bitcoin price was on a tear and set its currently all-time high of $73,737.94.For Ethereum, that means chasing a price of $4,878.26—which it last saw on November 10, 2021. That's around the time that prices were booming and the global crypto market capitalization inched past $3 trillion for the first time ever.And there are plenty of traders turning to derivatives in hopes it'll do just that. In the past day, Ethereum open interest has surged by 30% to an all-time high of $11 billion, according to Kaiko.As of this morning, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation now includes the VanEck Ethereum ETF on its active and pre-launch list. Hard to say whether that's a sign of an imminent approval, though.Tickers for Bitcoin ETFs appeared and then disappeared on the clearing house and settlement company's list all the way back in October, which was months before the SEC approved any for trading.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Popular Project Banned from Hong Kong! Detected to Violate the Confidentiality of Personal Data! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Office of the Personal Data Privacy Commissioner (PCPD) has completed its investigation into the Worldcoin project, finding that its activities in Hong Kong violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO).
Hong Kong Privacy Commission Orders Worldcoin to Stop Iris Scanning Operations
Privacy Commissioner Ms. Lillian Chung issued an enforcement notice requiring Worldcoin to stop using iris scanning devices to collect iris and facial images from the public.


The investigation revealed that Worldcoin violated various Data Protection Principles regarding the collection, storage, transparency, access and correction of personal data under the KVKK.
In particular, the collection of face and iris images was considered unnecessary and excessive. PCPD criticized Worldcoin's policy of storing personal data for up to 10 years to train artificial intelligence models used in identity verification processes, finding it excessive and unjustified.





Additionally, PCPD found that Worldcoin did not adequately inform participants about the purpose of data collection, their rights, and the means to access and correct their personal data as required by law.
The “Privacy Notice” and Consent Form for Biometric Data provided by Worldcoin did not have a Chinese version, and staff at collection sites did not explain or confirm that participants understood these documents.



PCPD conducted multiple visits to six Worldcoin locations in Hong Kong between December last year and January this year, including a court-ordered investigation in late January.
The investigation found that participants in the Worldcoin program were required to consent to the collection of facial and iris images through iris scanning to verify human identities and generate iris codes.





This verification process was a prerequisite for receiving a registered identity and free virtual currency known as “Worldcoin”.
Worldcoin confirmed that the faces and irises of a total of 8,302 people were scanned during its operation in Hong Kong.
This decision highlights the importance of complying with data protection laws and ensuring transparency and fairness in the collection and use of personal data.

BlackRock's Dominance in Bitcoin ETFs Drives Market to New Highs


							

Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $306 million in net inflow on Tuesday, May 21.



BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for $290 million of the total Bitcoin ETF inflow of May 21.



BTC surged 17% amid seven days of consecutive net ETF inflows.




The spot Bitcoin ETF market continued its strong performance with $306 million net inflow on Tuesday, May 21. With this milestone, the spot Bitcoin ETF achieved a consecutive net Outflow for seven days and a day when Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a $0.00 net inflow.







Meanwhile, the BlackRock IBIT maintained its impressive performance by ranking as the highest in net inflow. IBIT’s net inflow for Tuesday was $290 million, representing about 95% of the total daily net inflow in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.



Tuesday’s influx of investment into spot Bitcoin ETFs boosted the total net assets value across all the listed products by 4.29%. Consequently, the spot Bitcoin ETF total net assets after Tuesday’s inflow reached $58.91 billion, according to data from Soso Value, a financial research platform for crypto investors.



It is worth noting that the consecutive spot Bitcoin ETF inflow significantly affected Bitcoin’s price. The flagship cryptocurrency surged impressively during this period, pushing closer to the all-time high (ATH) established about two months ago.



Bitcoin started rallying on May 17, recording a daily profit of over 7.5% for the first time in nearly two months. The top cryptocurrency broke above significant resistance around $67,200, surpassing $70,000 for the first time in May.









TradingView data shows Bitcoin gained over 17% in the last seven days, with the bullish momentum intact. The latest rally launched the top crypto back into the bullish range and closer to the current ATH. Several crypto analysts believe a sustained net inflow rate would inject more bullish momentum into Bitcoin’s uptrend that could see BTC reach a new ATH soon.



Bitcoin traded for $69,826 at the time of writing, following a slight pullback from Tuesday’s $71,958 high. As Bitcoin edges closer to its all-time high, the sustained inflow into ETFs, driven by products like BlackRock’s IBIT, underscores a burgeoning confidence in cryptocurrency investments. With market momentum showing no signs of waning, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can sustain its bullish trajectory and possibly set new records.

Is China’s Bitcoin mining ban the worst decision this century?


    Though the process has been ongoing for a relatively long time – and even the most outspoken opponents of the crypto market have been getting involved, including during the ‘crypto winter’ – 2024 has been the year of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.



The trend has been most evident and extensive with regard to Bitcoin (BTC), particularly since the approval of the U.S.’ first-ever spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Indeed, these financial instruments have seen significant institutional interest in recent months, with investors of all stripes joining the action.







One country that has excluded itself from both the trend and its fruits – and which has, arguably, made it difficult for itself to catch up – is China.



In 2021, the government of the People’s Republic banned BTC mining within its borders, which—though it has failed to fully eliminate such activity—has significantly damaged the once-booming sector.



The ban quickly gutted the Chinese Bitcoin mining sector, which—after already declining in global market share between 2019 and 2021—fell to 0% at one point in 2021, per the data made available through the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI).



Though the figure rose somewhat with activity in China – mostly considered to consist of underground operations – standing close to 21%, it still marks a substantial drop from the final pre-ban mining market share of 46%.



China unlikely to be able to catch up



Finally, even if the Chinese government assesses in 2024 that its decision was a mistake given the recent mainstream legitimization of Bitcoin, it would likely have a hard time attempting to regain ground.



One of the biggest reasons behind the likely issues is the latest BTC halving that took place in April 2024. The event made it twice as difficult to obtain the coin, with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) recently revising the estimated cost of mining a single Bitcoin to $45,000.



The concerns associated with the increased mining difficulty are perhaps most evident in the stock prices of major BTC miners – such as Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) – which have declined since the start of the year despite the crypto market undergoing a large and broad rally.



Nonetheless, with Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs (ATH) in general in March, and, when denominated in yuan, in February, and with other important metrics such as the hashrate also being at their ATH, it is possible China will seek to reverse the ban.



Why China may not regard the ban as a mistake



Ultimately, while it is possible that the recent trends could force the Chinese government to reevaluate its ban, it is far from guaranteed, given that some of the primary stated reasons behind the decision are largely still relevant.



Though Bitcoin has been trading with relatively little volatility in recent years – at least by crypto market standards – it is doubtful whether the stability has already proven enough to negate the original argument of preserving financial stability.



Indeed, China expressed its concerns that Bitcoin might collapse to $0 as recently as 2022 – shortly after the ‘crypto winter’ started in May of the same year.



Similarly, though China has been working on increasing its reliance on green energy, the supply share has risen by only about 2% from 27.73% in 2021 to 29.14% in 2023, meaning that it is doubtful much has changed regarding the environmental argument.



Finally, the last major reason for the ban—concerns over capital flight—has arguably only increased given the global economy’s increased exposure to crypto markets and the higher rates of cryptocurrency adoption.



On the other hand, there have been some developments in China that hint toward a mode dovish stance on crypto, such as a conference in Nanjing that took place in late April and that saw a number of scholars agree on the need to afford digital assets a more concrete legal status in the country.

Trump Reportedly Made Over A Million In Recent Crypto Rally As Ex-President's Investments In Ethereum And Memecoin MAGA Continue To Surge - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency holdings have sparked widespread media interest and investigation in recent months. The firebrand leader, who has strongly marketed his pro-crypto stance in the ongoing election campaign, profited handsomely from the market's recent rally. What Happened: Trump's crypto portfolio was worth $8.65 million at the time of publication, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.The largest holding in his portfolio was Maga Coin TRUMP/USD, a memecoin inspired by the "Make America Great Again" political movement. The crypto rose 9% in the rally this week, pushing his total investments to $4.81 million, an increase of $520,000.The second-largest holding was Ethereum ETH/USD, followed by Wrapped Ether WETH/USD. Combined, Trump had nearly 815 ETH and WETH, worth more than $3 million at the time of writing.  ETH witnessed a 21% surge this week on higher expectations of spot Ether ETF approval, meaning that the rally added more than 500,000 to his ETH-WETH portfolio.  Overall, Trump's crypto portfolio gained more than a million in the rally, indicating a 13% increase. Why It Matters: Donald Trump is one of the biggest celebrity cryptocurrency owners, with one prior Arkham report revealing him to be at the top of the list in terms of crypto holdings of X celebrities with over a million followers.Coins such as ETH and WETH have been gained from the sale of NFT products featuring his name and likeness, while the project designers delivered the memecoin TRUMP to his address as a token of gratitude.The Republican challenger has looked to counter his arch-rival, President Joe Biden on the subject of cryptocurrencies and regulations. He also started accepting cryptocurrency for official campaign donations. Read Next: Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!

Bitcoin ETF IBIT Records Biggest Inflows Since April as BTC Hovers at $70K

Tuesday’s figures now stand out as unusually large compared to activity early this month, where IBIT recorded low or even zero inflows before May 15. IBIT also recorded its first-ever day of outflows in April, leading to some bearish sentiment for bitcoin at the time, as reported.

Bitcoin Price (BTC-USDT) Analysis for 22 May 2024: Key Support and Resistance Levels Explained by Macro Trader | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 22 May 2024, a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price action was shared by pseudonymous analyst Bitmidas on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). This analysis provided an in-depth look at the market dynamics, offering valuable insights into the current and future state of BTC’s performance.







The analysis began by noting a divergence between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the previous day. While ETH managed to stabilize, BTC struggled, adjusting towards $69,413.07 and eventually bottoming at $69,162.94. It was highlighted that today’s support level is shifting to $69,031.98, and despite the oscillations, the overall trend remains bullish.



There was a significant net outflow of $16.81 billion the previous day. Although the price drop was modest, the high price and trading volume meant that outflows nearly matched the prior day’s inflows. BTC attempted to stabilize but failed to follow ETH’s performance, breaking below $70,495.27 and adjusting towards $69,413.07.



Despite the failed stabilization attempt, BTC is still within a bullish oscillation. The key support zone for the day is identified as $69,031.98 to $68,544.98, with the price likely to oscillate between this zone and $71,016.08. If BTC can maintain the level of $70,495.27 for 4-8 hours, it could potentially target $71,016.08. Breaking this minor resistance might lead to higher targets of $72,860.67 to $73,320.85. However, multiple dips below the support zone of $69,031.98 to $68,544.98 could shift the trend to a bearish oscillation.



Additional data on capital flow shows that the support range is between $68,544.98 and $65,844.59. The daily sentiment remains predominantly bullish at 90%, with a slight 10% bearish outlook. The long/short ratio stands at 1.19, indicating a slight advantage for long positions. Funding rates range from 0.01% to 0.0213%, reflecting a strong but slightly receding bullish sentiment. The total contracts in the market amount to $350.9 billion, a 0.92% increase, and the greed index is at 76, suggesting a high level of market optimism. The turnover rate is at 25%, indicative of active trading.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analysis continued by discussing the minor adjustments due to BTC’s failed stabilization. Early data showed a slight tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with bulls attempting to reclaim stabilization points and bears pushing towards the capital flow support levels. The increased oscillation suggests traders should exercise caution.



Despite the recent volatility, BTC remains in a long-term bullish trend. There are no immediate low-entry opportunities, and ongoing observation of macroeconomic data is essential. The long-term strategy still favors buying on dips, reinforcing a cautiously optimistic outlook.



Finally, the broader economic environment was considered. Several Federal Reserve officials made cautious statements, indicating that they are closely monitoring monthly data. They hinted at potential rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024, which could have significant implications for the crypto market.







While technical analysis can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential price movements, it does not guarantee future performance. Market conditions can change rapidly due to various factors, including economic events and investor sentiment. Traders should use technical analysis as one of many tools in their decision-making process and remain aware of the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency trading. Always consider your own risk tolerance and financial situation before making investment decisions.

                        The U.S. prosecutors are pushing for a prison sentence of five to seven years for the former FTX executive Ryan Salame.According to a sentencing memorandum, the attorneys of the Southern District of New York have argued for an extended imprisonment term, citing the seriousness and the general deterrence in imposing sentence.Former FTX Executive’s Crimes of Seriousness
The document stated that Salame was first the head of the Settlements Team at Alameda and then CEO of FTX Digital Markets from 2019 to 2022, during which he assisted Samuel Bankman-Fried in “perpetrating aspects of the interrelated frauds.”The attorneys elaborated that Salame was found guilty for “unlicensed money transmission and false statements to banks” and “unlawful political contributions through Alameda.”“For instance, he was relied upon to integrate FTX into the Bahamas (Def. Mem. at 9), and he spoke to Caroline Ellison about ways to retrieve funds from cryptocurrency exchanges in China that had frozen Alameda accounts (Tr. 830),” the memo reads.The memo also included the recommended sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment by the Probation Office, considering serious offense conduct, the large amounts of money involved, and the need for general deterrence.“In light of the defendant’s serious crimes, which were designed to undermine the integrity of the U.S. campaign finance system and the U.S. financial system, a substantial term of incarceration, well above the 18 months’ he requests, is required,” the memo reads.Salame Requests 18 Months or Less
The lawyers of the defendant submitted the sentencing memo on May 14, urging a prison time no longer than 18 months.“Such a sentence would satisfy the purposes of sentencing … while allowing Ryan to have the opportunity to continue contributing positively toward society,” the defendant’s sentencing memo reads.Salame’s attorneys argued that he did not play a central role in the fraudulent activities and lost a significant portion of his personal fortune with the collapse of FTX. The sentencing is scheduled for May 28

Economist Henrik Zeberg Issues Dire Warning, Says Fed Cannot Stop Major Recession at End of 2024 - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed economist is warning that a major economic event last witnessed almost a century ago will likely rear its ugly head in 2025.
Henrik Zeberg tells his 140,700 followers on the social media platform X that he sees risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto going higher and higher for the next few months.










However, the economist predicts that the bullish conditions will abruptly subside toward the end of the year, just as market participants become extremely exuberant.
“You may not like it. You may not understand it.
But the bull market has an end date – this year! A blow-off top!
First US markets will explode higher. Crypto and small caps will soar as we see a rotation from large caps and foreign markets (outside the US).
Everybody will become euphoric and once again trust that the Fed will have our backs.
But a major recession will set in at the end of the year.” 
According to Zeberg, the Fed will try to support the economy by printing money to stimulate growth. But he says the Fed’s actions will only delay an economic collapse that will eventually give rise to stagflation – a period of slow economic growth with climbing unemployment and high inflation.
“Fed will intervene – yes – but will only create a bounce in markets, as they enter with monetary stimulus when recession and deflation stare them in the eyes.
They will offset stagflation! 
Consequence: largest recession and bear market since 1929 in two stages. First deflation, then bounce, later stagflation.”
In January 2023, Zeberg predicted that the stock market would reach record highs before witnessing a sudden crash. At the time, the S&P 500 was trading at around 4,000 points and Bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.
At time of writing, the S&P 500 is hovering at 5,321 points and BTC is trading at $70,150.

Crypto Market Eyes Ether ETF Approval: Lubin Cautions on Supply Constraints


							

Joe Lubin warns of a potential Ether shortage with the launch of the Spot Ether ETF, raising supply concerns.



Bloomberg analysts increase Ether ETF approval odds to 75%, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment.



ETH sees a substantial surge, trading at $3,757 with 27% of the supply staked, highlighting growing market interest.




Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin has warned of a potential scarcity in the Ether (ETH) supply following the launch of the Spot Ether ETF. While anticipation of the ETF launch grows, Lubin asserted that the “floodgate” of ETH demand might lead to a significant shortage in supply.



Though the community was initially pessimistic about the SEC’s decision on Ether ETFs, reports suggest a potential approval of nine Ether ETF issuers’ applications this week. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of Ether ETF approval from 25% to 75%.







Reflecting on the positive development in the industry, Lubin highlighted a potential increase in the demand for Ether and Ether ETFs, noting that Spot Bitcoin ETF investors may “likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF.”



Lubin asserted, “There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether.” However, he added that Ether will be insufficient at the time to satisfy the demand.









Comparing the Bitcoin ETF launch and Bitcoin’s supply at the time with the Ether ETF and ETH supply, Lubin argued that the ETH tokens available will be much fewer than Bitcoin. Providing further insights, Lubin pointed out, “Much of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs.” His arguments highlight that a significant portion of ETH supply will be unavailable for ETF consumption.



As of press time, ETH is exchanging hands at $3,757, marking a daily increase of 3.2%. Over the past 7 days, ETH has seen a substantial surge of nearly 30% and 16% surge over the last 30 days. While Ether holds a total supply of 120,128,511 ETH, according to onchain data, 27% of the supply is staked across the Ethereum network.

Uniswap Responses to SEC: Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities


Uniswap Labs, the leading developer of the decentralized trading platform on Ethereum, asserted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) potential enforcement action against it lacks merit. 
According to the New York-based startup, crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. Instead, they are files similar to PDFs.
Why Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities

On Tuesday, Uniswap Labs contested the allegations that it operates an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows a Wells notice served by the SEC’s Enforcement Division last month, indicating plans to recommend legal action against the company.
Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, spoke at a press conference, emphasizing the SEC’s flawed assumption that all tokens are securities. Uniswap Labs also argues that now, the SEC risks an adverse decision that could limit its authority over crypto tokens.

“Tokens are, in fact, simply a file format. They are a file format for value and they are not inherently securities. The SEC has to essentially unilaterally change the definitions of exchange, broker and investment contract in order to try to capture what we do.” Ammori said.

In a 40-page response, the company expressed its readiness to litigate if necessary, asserting confidence in its legal standing. 
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently argued that decentralized exchanges fall within the SEC’s regulatory scope. He has stated that many digital assets are unregistered securities subject to SEC rules. 
However, Uniswap Labs maintains that UNI tokens, its governance tokens, do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This legal standard from a Supreme Court ruling defines investment contracts. 
In light of these developments, Uniswap’s UNI token saw a 4% increase in value over the past 24 hours, trading at $9.63.

The broader crypto market closely watches the SEC’s actions, especially as the US election approaches and crypto becomes a significant political issue. Some believe that the SEC’s stance on crypto may be shifting. Also there are expectations that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23. 

This anticipated approval is believed to result from political pressure. Crypto enthusiasts speculate that the Biden administration and former President Donald Trump might have realized the crypto community’s growing influence. 
Not to mention, Trump’s campaign recently allowed donations via crypto, signaling a more crypto-friendly approach.

“Biden and Trump now trying to outdo each other pandering to the crypto bros. Flawless victory,” Venture capitalist Nic Carter said.

Waiting for Ethereum ETF? Analyst predicts launch delay - AMBCrypto



ETH ETF approval could be likely, but the official launch could take some time, per analyst. 
Mixed feelings on the potential threat of ETH ETF, if approved, to BTC ETFs. 

Crypto markets rallied early in the week following a positive update on US spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF approvals. 
However, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, despite the positive SEC update on the ETH ETF approvals, the official launch and listing could take longer. 
“Still a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate.”
Notably, on 21st May, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) submitted five amended 19b-4s on behalf of Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark Invest/21Shares, and Franklin Templeton.  
While this renewed interest and update was positive, Seyffart added that, 
‘Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s, AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch.’ 
The 19b-4s forms are exchange rule changes submitted by exchanges for new funds, while S-1 filings are from individual issuers. Both forms must be approved before launching ETFs. 
Staking feature removed from Ethereum ETF filings
Another important update on the process was the apparent removal of ETH staking wordings from the recently amended 19b-4s filings. 
According to Seyffart, the amended filings replaced previous staking wordings with outright clear writing, 
‘Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.’
Most market watchers have long argued that the staking feature could complicate the approval process and raise questions about ETH’s ‘security’ status. 
Nevertheless, some quarters aren’t happy with the swift approval of ETH ETF, given that Bitcoin ETFs took almost 10 years to achieve. One user claimed that an ETH ETF approval will indicate that the ‘market is not regulated by competent actors.’
The user added that the approval will make ETH a Bitcoin equivalent, yet Ethereum’s ecosystem is full of ‘centralized sh*tcoins.’
On his part, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, asserted that ETF inflows could help ETH come out of the shadows of Solans[SOL] and BTC. 
In fact, Thompson added that ETH ETF, if approved, could attract inflows from BTC ETFs. Even Peter Schiff echoed Thompson’s sentiment. If confirmed, it remains to be seen whether ETH ETF could be a threat to BTC ETFs.

Kakarot ZK-EVM Launches Testnet, Paving The Way For EVM-Compatibility On Starknet - The Defiant

Kakarot Labs is backed by StarkWare and Vitalik Buterin.Starknet, the seventh-largest Layer 2 network by TVL, will soon enjoy EVM-compatibility, opening the floodgates to established DeFi protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem.On May 22, Kakarot Labs launched the public mainnet phase for its modular Cairo-based zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The move sets the stage for Starknet's ecosystem to become EVM-compatible, with the popular Layer 2 leveraging the Cairo programming language and facilitating smart contract execution via its bespoke CairoVM.“Kakarot is essentially an Ethereum execution engine built with Cairo,” said Elias Tazartes, CEO and co-founder of Kakarot Labs. “In time, this engine will be integrated into Starknet appchains, thus allowing any ZK-rollup that uses the Cairo stack to be EVM compatible.”The Kakarot ZK-EVM was first created in October 2022 through a joint development effort from the StarkWare Exploration Team and the open-source Starknet developer community.In June 2023, Kakarot Labs announced a pre-seed investment round featuring participation from StarkWare, the team behind Starknet, and Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s chief scientist.EVM-compatibilityWhile Starknet currently ranks as the seventh-largest Layer 2 with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to L2beat, the lion’s share of its TVL was achieved through its long-anticipated STARK airdrop on Feb. 20.The drop was the largest in the history of web3, with the project distributing $2.1 billion worth of tokens at a $30 billion fully diluted valuation per STARK’s initial trading price. The drop also catapulted Starknet’s TVL more than 550% to $1.22 billion from $187 million overnight.However, Starknet’s modest pre-airdrop TVL illustrates the barriers posed to the network's growth by its lack of EVM-compatibility, with its TVL having sluggishly risen from $56 million in May 2023 to $187 million in February. By contrast, many EVM-compatible L2s have quickly garnered momentum by enabling established protocols leveraging Solidity — Ethereum’s primary coding language — to easily migrate onto new networks.“Today, developers looking to build on the Starknet Stack faced the challenge of learning Cairo, the programming language developed especially for STARK cryptography, distinct from Solidity, the mainstay language of Ethereum,” Kakarot Labs said. “The introduction of Kakarot zkEVM will eliminate this barrier by enabling developers to use Solidity, thereby fostering a more inclusive environment within the ecosystem.”Kakarot’s public whitelist phase is the first of three test network deployments, with the project set to follow up with a public whitelist and permissionless public testnet launches.The project said its testnet deployments will allow developers to experiment. familiar tooling such as MetaMask and Foundry within a Cairo-based setting. “By participating in this phase, developers can test and optimize new protocol changes and the latest advancements in crypto user experiences,” Kakarot said.

Target Q1 Revenue Declined by 3.1%, EPS Short of Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) reported its first quarter 2024 financial results, reflecting a performance consistent with its expectations. The company posted a total revenue of $24.53 billion, a 3.1% decrease from the previous year’s $25.32 billion. This decline was driven by a 3.2% drop in total sales, partially offset by a 3.9% increase in other revenue. The operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 2.4% from the prior year’s $1.33 billion, primarily due to lower sales volume.



The first quarter operating income margin rate improved slightly to 5.3% from 5.2% in the previous year. This improvement was attributed to a 140 basis point increase in the gross margin rate, which rose to 27.7% from 26.3% last year. The gross margin rate benefited from cost improvements that offset higher promotional markdown rates, favorable category mix, and lower book-to-physical inventory adjustments compared to the prior year.



Target Fails to Meet EPS Forecast in Q1, Revenue in Line with Expectations



Target’s performance in the first quarter matched the company’s projections but fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company reported a diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.03, slightly below the expected $2.06. This figure also represented a minor decline from the previous year’s EPS of $2.05. Despite the shortfall in EPS, the company’s revenue of $24.53 billion closely aligned with the forecasted $24.51 billion.



Comparable sales for the quarter declined by 3.7%, which aligned with the expectations. This decline included a 4.8% decrease in store-originated sales, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in digitally-originated sales. Notably, same-day services grew nearly 9%, led by more than 13% growth in Drive Up. The company also saw continued growth in the Beauty category, which helped mitigate declines in discretionary categories.





Target Corporation Expects Q2 EPS to Range Between $1.95 and $2.35



Target Corporation provided guidance for the second quarter and the full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, the company expects a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales and projects GAAP and adjusted EPS to range between $1.95 and $2.35. For the full year, the company maintains its forecast of a 0% to 2% increase in comparable sales, with GAAP and adjusted EPS anticipated to be between $8.60 and $9.60.



The company’s leadership expressed optimism about returning to growth in the second quarter. Brian Cornell, chair and CEO of Target Corporation, highlighted the improved topline performance for the third consecutive quarter, driven by growth in the digital business, particularly in same-day fulfillment services. Cornell emphasized the company’s commitment to delivering value and convenience to consumers, supported by the successful relaunch of the Target Circle loyalty program, which added over 1 million new members in the first quarter.



Target Paid Dividends of $508 Million, ROIC Improved



Target’s operational efficiency showed mixed results. The company’s SG&A expense rate increased to 21.1% from 19.8% the previous year, reflecting lower sales and higher costs, including pay, benefits, and marketing investments. Despite these higher expenses, disciplined cost management helped mitigate the impact on the overall financial performance. The company’s net interest expense decreased significantly to $106 million from $147 million last year, primarily due to higher interest income from increased cash balances.



On the capital deployment front, Target paid dividends of $508 million, reflecting a 1.9% increase in the dividend per share. However, the company did not repurchase any stock during the quarter, leaving approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program. Additionally, the company’s after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) improved to 15.4% from 11.4% in the prior year, driven by higher operating income and higher average invested capital.

Every 96th person on the planet currently owns at least $1 in Bitcoin


    Though the road has been rocky, with the 12 months starting in May 2022 being particularly dark for the industry, cryptocurrencies have, nonetheless, shown their resilience and continued their integration with the global financial systems.



So far, 2024 is proving to be a particularly eventful year given that it started with the approval of the U.S.’ first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – instruments that have already done much to expand investors’ exposure to the crypto market.



Bitcoin adoption is also evident in another statistic – the number of addresses that hold at least $1 worth of the coin. 







Indeed, in 2022, Finbold reported that there are as many as 35 million addresses holding at least $1 worth of BTC – up to 0.4% of the global population at the time.



Figures retrieved in May 2024 from BitInfoCharts.com indicate that the number has risen significantly, and there are, in fact, as many as 84 million such addresses. This means that approximately one out of every 96 people in the world might own at least some Bitcoin – slightly more than 1% of the global population of 8.1 billion.



Number of addresses with more than $1 worth of BTC. Source: BitInfoCharts



It is important to note that this figure represents an upper bound, as a single individual may hold Bitcoin in multiple accounts, resulting in more than one address per person.



Likewise, at least some of the rise might be accounted for by the increase in the price of the cryptocurrency as Bitcoin price today stands at $69,953 following a 66.10% year-to-date (YTD) rise.



BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



Drivers for Bitcoin ownership



It is, in general, likely that the ongoing crypto market boom is responsible for the number of relevant Bitcoin addresses as investors were likely keen to take advantage of the rally. 



The trend was only boosted by the bullish forecasts surrounding the latest BTC halving event – which occurred in April – and by the mainstream legitimization offered by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs.



Indeed, though many prominent cryptocurrency advocates are generally not appreciative of SEC’s hawkish approach to the industry, there is a strong possibility that the higher levels of discussion stemming from enforcement actions  – along with the sense of a lawman arriving in the Wild West – has done much to make digital assets appear as sensible investments to more traditional traders.

Dycom Industries (DY) Shines with $1.142 Billion in Contract Revenues - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, showcasing a notable performance improvement. The company reported contract revenues of $1.142 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared to $1.045 billion in the same quarter last year. This growth includes a 2.5% organic increase, excluding $71.2 million from acquired businesses. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA rose to $130.9 million, or 11.5% of contract revenues, up from $113.5 million, or 10.9%, in the previous year. Net income also significantly rose to $62.6 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $51.5 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, in the prior year.



During the quarter, Dycom repurchased 210,000 common shares for $29.8 million, reflecting confidence in its financial health and future prospects. The company’s strategic acquisitions and organic growth have contributed to this robust performance, indicating a well-executed business plan. The increase in net income was partly due to income tax benefits from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards, amounting to $5.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.



Dycom Industries Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Dycom significantly outperformed the anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.51 by delivering $2.12 per diluted share. This represents a substantial positive variance, showcasing the company’s ability to exceed market forecasts. Additionally, the actual revenue of $1.142 billion surpassed the expected $1.09 billion, highlighting a strong demand for Dycom’s services and effective execution of its projects.



The company’s performance metrics, such as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and net income, indicate a successful quarter beyond just meeting expectations. The Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.5% from 10.9% in the previous year, suggesting better operational efficiency and cost management. The increase in net income, bolstered by higher revenues and tax benefits, further underscores Dycom’s robust financial health and strategic prowess.





Dycom Expects Contract Revenues to Grow by High Single Digits for the Next Quarter



Dycom provided optimistic guidance for the next quarter ending July 27, 2024. The company expects organic contract revenues to grow by high single-digits compared to the same quarter last year, alongside approximately $70 million from acquired contract revenues. This forward-looking statement suggests continued growth and integration of recent acquisitions, which are expected to contribute positively to the overall revenue.



Additionally, Dycom anticipates an increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contract revenues by 25 to 75 basis points compared to the quarter ended July 29, 2023. This guidance indicates a focus on maintaining and potentially improving operational efficiencies while scaling up revenues. Investors and stakeholders can access detailed guidance and additional information on the company’s website, reflecting Dycom’s commitment to transparency and informed investor relations.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales have continued their heavy accumulation of digital currency. According to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock, large whale transactions come in at 73.72% within a 24-hour period. Per the data shared, a total of 327 large transactions were recorded in 24 hours, setting SHIB on an ambitious growth course.SHIB Large Transaction Chart. Source: IntoTheBlockIn actual volume, a total of 5.58 trillion SHIB was acquired by Shiba Inu whales in 24 hours. This SHIB volume is worth a total of $145.48 million, placing Shiba Inu among the most traded tokens by whales thus far this week. With whale transactions tagged as those with a monetary value of at least $100,000, the attractiveness of Shiba Inu has continued to grow. With more than 5.5 trillion tokens scooped up, the supply crunch introduced into the ecosystem might help sustain the bull rally it has printed in the past few days.However, the entire Shib Inu protocol, as reported earlier by U.Today, paints a problematic picture. After soaring as high as 10% in a single day, jumping above the 50-day EMA, the failure of SHIB’s price to continue the rally, according to numerous data, shows concerns.At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00002612, up by 2.72% in the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu has been making a frantic effort to soar above the current price range and possibly break toward the $0.00007 high. These efforts have been backed by the intense deflationary push through its burn rate and aggressive Shibarium transaction growth.With these apparent efforts, Shiba Inu is arguably moving in tandem with the broader market. It is following the slower pace of the combined market to chart its growth course. However, there are expectations that the token will print a breakout in the long term.

Bitcoin ETFs See Significant Increases as Markets Lock on Ethereum ETF Approval! Which Company Is Leading? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are seeing significant investment inflows, recording their seventh consecutive day of net inflows on Tuesday. This increase in interest comes amid growing excitement over the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Strong Inflows Amid Ethereum ETF Speculation
A total of $305.72 million was transferred to spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to data from multiple sources.



BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust led the way, attracting $290 million of total inflows. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund also had a positive impact, bringing in $26 million.

In contrast, Grayscale's transformed Bitcoin Trust, which experienced cumulative net outflows of $18 billion, recorded no net inflows on Tuesday.
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and VanEck Bitcoin Trust were the only funds to see outflows, with net losses of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs did not report any inflows or outflows.






Since their introduction to US exchanges, spot Bitcoin ETFs have been extremely popular, generating total net inflows of $13.17 billion.
The recent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has shifted the focus in the cryptocurrency and financial markets to the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked exchanges to amend their 19b-4 filings earlier this week, hinting at a possible move towards approval of these products.

How a Bitcoin Pizza Trade Pushed Decentralized Money into the Spotlight 14 Years Ago - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Fourteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 BTC, a transaction worth over $700 million today. This historic event marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin. It demonstrated the potential of decentralized digital currency, setting the stage for a revolution in finance.



Bitcoin is the World’s First Widely-Adopted Decentralized Digital Currency 



Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The concept behind Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would operate without a central authority, such as banks or governments. Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin offer several advantages over traditional currencies, including lower transaction fees, increased security, and the ability to conduct transactions without intermediaries.





A Programmer from Florida Paid 10,000 BTC for Two Large Pizzas



On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, made a post on the BitcoinTalk forum offering to pay 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. On the forum, Jeremy Sturdivant (known as “jercos”) accepted the offer and arranged to deliver two Papa John’s pizzas to Hanyecz’s home. This transaction, worth roughly $41 then, marked the first documented real-world use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s potential for everyday transactions.

                        Stephen Findeisen, popularly known as “Coffeezilla” on YouTube, has accused artificial intelligence company Rabbit AI of orchestrating a nonfungible token (NFT) scam and attempting to cover it up.Findeisen, a prominent investigator on the video-sharing platform, recently released a video on the Coffeezilla channel, shedding light on Rabbit AI’s alleged involvement in the NFT space.According to Findeisen’s findings, Rabbit AI was previously known as Cyber Manufacture Co. and managed to raise $6 million for an NFT project named Gama.However, the company’s founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, later distanced Rabbit AI from the world of cryptocurrencies, stating that they would “never touch crypto” in Discord statements.Fun Little Project
Lyu claimed that Gama was merely a “fun little project” he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the associated game was open-sourced.Contradicting Lyu’s claims, Findeisen presented recordings in which Lyu discussed ambitious plans for the Gama project.In those recordings, Lyu expressed intentions of investing millions into Gama to create a groundbreaking NFT experience.He also mentioned future plans for a concept called Gamaverse and the potential for a clean energy initiative in relation to Gama Coin.Findeisen raised concerns about the $6 million funding raised for the Gama project, questioning where the money had been allocated.Despite Rabbit AI’s assertion that the funds were solely used for the NFT project, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit AI’s foundation was built on the remnants of the Gama project, making it a matter of concern.Additionally, Findeisen criticized the overhyped nature of Rabbit AI’s viral R1 product, drawing parallels between the exaggerated promises made by both Gama and R1.Coffeezilla’s allegations are not isolated, as others have also expressed skepticism about Rabbit AI’s offerings.Josh Olin, the founder and CEO of WeGPT, previously labeled Rabbit’s project as a “scam,” characterizing it as a quick cash grab designed to lure in investors.Logan Paul-Coffeezilla Cryptozoo Controversy
Online detective Coffeezilla has made himself a reputation by uncovering crypto scams.Specifically, he made headlines last year for going after popular YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul to expose his “scam” project CryptoZoo.CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021 with much fanfare, with Paul himself being one of the founders of the project.The game utilized its own cryptocurrency called ZooCoin, with buyers able to purchase “eggs” that would hatch into randomized animals with different rarities.These animals could then be bred to create cross-bred creatures that would act as NFTs. The NFTs could be held or burned to earn more ZooCoin, purportedly providing buyers with significant returns on their investments.However, in a three-part series of videos uploaded at the end of 2021, Coffeezilla alleged that CryptoZoo had been largely abandoned shortly after its launch.He claimed that Paul distanced himself from the project, despite the extensive pre-release attention he had given it.In response to Coffeezilla’s allegations, Paul released a video blaming the co-founders and advisors of CryptoZoo for any wrongdoing and sensationalizing the story. He even threatened to sue Coffeezilla.

Smart traders take millions in profit from this crypto as retail FOMO in


    High recent on-chain activity has registered at least three smart traders taking profits from the popular meme coin PEPE. These cryptocurrency whales have made millions of dollars in trades as retail jumps in with ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO).



Finbold gathered this data from four different Lookonchain reports posted on X on May 22, suggesting a reversal could happen.



PEPE smart traders’ whale activity



First, an early buyer deposited all their 182.9 billion PEPE holdings, worth $2.53 million, into a Binance account. This was the remaining amount of a $462 initial purchase of 324.9 billion PEPE last year. In total, this smart trade rendered over $3.4 million in profits.

Second, the institutional investment firm BlockTower Capital sent $2.8 million worth of 202 billion PEPE to Cumberland, a known market maker that provides liquidity for institutional and retail trading. The transaction happened as the meme coin price broke through $0.000014 per token.



This was a six-day swing trade that earned BlockTower Capital $578,000 in profits on a $2.22 million investment.

Last, a smart trader deposited $2.83 million of PEPE to the Bybit crypto exchange as its third profitable trade. This trader is considered smart due to its 100% win rate trading PEPE, for an estimated total profit of $2.48 million.

FOMO: Retail and whales are still buying



Meanwhile, a few hours after the last activity, another whale withdrew $7.95 million in 592 billion PEPE from Binance. Lookonchain estimates this resulted from a two-day purchase during a notable price pump for the meme coin.







On May 19, Finbold reported another trader who lost $300,000 in two days of bad trading decisions with PEPE.



Moreover, Finbold gathered data from Santiment showing an increased social volume, indicating increased retail interest. Usually, these social indicators peak a few days before a trend reversal, as smart trader whales take profit over the FOMOing retail.

Meme coins and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.

Crypto security: $22 million returned to Gala Games

A couple of days ago, a security incident occurred involving the crypto of Gala Games.
 A hacker managed to access the platform with the administrator address of Gala Games, and created 5 billion new GALA tokens.  

Subsequently, he transferred approximately 4,600 ETH to 0x, and sold 600 million of the tokens he minted on Uniswap, cashing in 21 million dollars. 
Subsequently, 4.4 billion GALA tokens were burned.


The return of the bull and bear funds 
Yesterday, more than 5,900 ETH (over 22 million dollars) were sent from the hacker’s wallet to Gala Games.

L’ipotesi è che abbia deciso di restituire parte del bottino. 
According to Gala Games, the decision would have been the result of their timely and effective response, and the involvement of law enforcement. 
“`html
As they stated yesterday in a post on their official blog, the unauthorized wallet was locked down in record time, and the funds were returned because the security measures proved to be effective.
“`
Something similar, however, had also happened in the past, so it is difficult to imagine that the security measures worked 100%. 
The reaction of Gala Games: our crypto security worked
On Monday afternoon, an unusual transfer of GALA tokens occurred on the Ethereum network worth 200 million dollars.
Gala Games promptly responded by activating the blocklist protocol of GalaChain, to quickly block any further unauthorized minting and movement of GALA tokens, thus mitigating the effects of the incident.
Thanks to the swift intervention, within 45 minutes of the unauthorized minting, approximately 90% of the GALA tokens minted by the hacker were blocked. 
This was made possible thanks to a new feature implemented with the update to version v2.
Subsequently, Gala Games contacted the U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, hoping that they will initiate a thorough investigation and appropriate legal action against the culprits.
They also claim that the minting capabilities of GALA on GalaChain would still be secure, because the internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents and are continuously improved to keep up with new potential threats.
They have also decided to reimburse anyone who has been subject to unreasonably high transaction fees associated with this incident.
Gala Games:  La questione della sicurezza crypto 
Security on blockchain smart contracts is fundamental because they are public and accessible to everyone. 
In this case, the violation was carried out against the Gala platform, and in particular against the administrator’s account. 
Despite this, they claim that their security measures are solid and effective, and that they are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency. 
They justify the problem by saying that being pioneers in unknown territories can sometimes be a risky activity, but they assure that GalaChain is well-equipped to handle any unforeseen challenge that Web3 may throw. 
The token GALA
Today the price of the GALA token on the crypto markets has increased by 13%.
In reality, it has simply returned to the level prior to the news of the incident, given that on Monday it was above 46 thousandths of a dollar and today it has returned to just below 47 thousandths. 
Yesterday it had dropped to below 42 thousandths, with a daily loss of more than 12%. 
It is worth noting that at the beginning of 2024 it was at 30 thousandths, and during the month of February it rose significantly, reaching a peak of over 87 thousandths in early March. 
In April, however, it had already fallen below 35 thousandths, but only to bounce back above 50 thousandths at the end of the month. 
In May, it first fell below 39 thousandths and then recovered and rose above 46. 
The current price is in line with that of April 25, and it is 55% higher than at the beginning of the year. 
It should be remembered, however, that it is still down by as much as -94% compared to the highs of 2021, but that was a truly gigantic speculative bubble. 
At the end of 2020, the price was below 1 thousandth of a dollar, and by March 2021 it had already risen above 30 thousandths, which is a level in line with the current one. 
The bull si è gonfiata da settembre a novembre, quando nel giro di poco più di due mesi il prezzo schizzò ad oltre 824 millesimi. 
The burst of the bubble ended in January 2023 when the price had fallen below 17 thousandths. Even in November, it was just above 18 thousandths. 
Sure, here is the translation:
“`html
The company Gala Games 
“`
Gala Games è una piattaforma di gaming che vuole restituire ai gamer il controllo sui loro giochi. 
Their mission is to create blockchain games, but with the goal of radically changing the online gaming market. 
Their platform is also equipped with a voting mechanism, based on the Founder’s Node, which allows players to express their opinion on the games that Gala should develop and on which games should receive funding. 
Since its launch in 2019, Gala Games has reached 1.3 million active users and has sold over 26,000 NTF.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hovers Around $70K After ETF Records Month-High Inflows

Bitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday's rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.

WisdomTree, Managing $111 Billion, Received Approval to List Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's critical decision on spot Ethereum ETFs was awaited, positive news came from the UK.
WisdomTree has received approval to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investment products (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, Coindesk reported.


World-renowned asset manager WisdomTree (WT) announced that it has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
In the statement made today, it was stated that WisdomTree's Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will begin trading on May 28 and will be open to professional investors only.





The company, which has more than $111 billion in assets under management and a spot BTC ETF (WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund -BTCW) approved in the US, has been offering crypto products on European exchanges since 2019.
The FCA banned crypto derivatives, including ETPs, in January 2020. But the FCA said it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, softening its bans after such crypto-based products have been widely used in Europe for several years and the approval of spot ETFs in the US in January.


While the FCA has approved crypto ETPs for professional investors, the ban remains in place for retail investors.

Global Bitcoin ATM Numbers Decline for the First Time Since July 2023



                    

For the first time since July 2023, the number of active Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has decreased.



The United States and Canada dominate the Bitcoin ATM landscape, accounting for 91.4% of the global network. The U.S. hosts 31,089 (82.6%) machines, while Canada has 2,909 (7.7%).




In 2024, countries worldwide significantly contributed to the month-on-month increase in Bitcoin ATMs, nearly reaching the 38,000 mark lost in January 2023. 



However, the 10-month-long global growth streak ended when over 300 ATMs went offline in May 2024. 



As of May 21, the U.S. market saw a loss of 302 Bitcoin ATMs, and Canada lost 28 machines.




Despite these losses, new Bitcoin ATMs in Australia, Switzerland, and Europe helped reduce the net decline to 280 machines at the time of publication.



Law enforcement agencies in the U.S. actively pursue and shut down Bitcoin ATMs frequently used for extortion and scams.

However, the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in their numbers remain unclear.




Australia hosts the third-largest network of active Bitcoin ATMs after the U.S. and Canada, with 1,041 (2.8%) machines.



Bitcoin Depot, the largest ATM operator in the U.S., recorded steady earnings in 2024. 



The firm stated in its 10-K annual report filed on April 15 that there was no correlation between its revenues and the price of Bitcoin historically.



“Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others,” Bitcoin Depot wrote.



According to the ATM operator, the lack of correlation between Bitcoin Depot’s revenues and the BTC price is partly due to the nature of the services provided.

Trump crypto donations: Better 'financial choices' or 'another cow to milk'? - AMBCrypto



Donald Trump has started accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign.
Cryptocurrencies see an increased importance in the political discourse.

As anticipation builds for the United States presidential elections of 2024, former President Donald Trump has made a bold move.
On the 21st of May, Trump’s presidential campaign launched a fundraising page, enabling federally permissible donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through Coinbase Commerce.
This move stands in stark contrast to his opponent, President Joe Biden, who has been known to advocate for stricter crypto regulations.
Trump’s bold move
The announcement highlighted the reasons behind this decision and read,
“Today’s announcement reflects President Trump’s commitment to an agenda that values freedom over socialistic government control.”
Providing further insight into the Trump campaign’s intentions, the announcement emphasized,
“Biden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an ‘anti-crypto army’ to restrict Americans’ right to make their own financial choices. MAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!”
The remark on the ‘anti-crypto army’ was made in line with Warren’s re-election ad in March 2023.
Donald Trump donations are a paradigm shift 
These recent developments underscore a notable shift in the political landscape: in previous election cycles, cryptocurrency held little sway.
However, heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting numerous crypto firms has ignited a debate among voters.
This newfound attention has pushed cryptocurrency into the forefront of political debate and campaign tactics, making it a big deal in the 2024 elections.
These developments beg the question: Will Trump’s recent actions reduce Biden’s chances of winning the election?
Trump’s various pro-crypto stance 
Trump has actively embraced cryptocurrency, including selling limited-run NFT trading cards for cryptocurrency in December 2023 and hosting a lavish dinner for his NFT buyers at the Mar-a-Lago club earlier in May.
In contrast, Biden’s campaign reflects his administration’s cautious stance towards cryptocurrency and its proponents.
Well, Trump is not the first to accept crypto donations. Back in 2015, Sen. Rand Paul accepted Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign.
Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also announced in May 2023 that his independent presidential bid would accept bitcoin donations.
However, despite Trump’s efforts to gain traction in the presidential race, David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless, argues that his pro-crypto stance is nothing more than a joke.

Could Investors Cause Toncoin (TON) Price Correction?


Toncoin’s (TON) price failed to mark a new all-time high despite attempting to breach the key resistance of $7.0.
The likely reason behind this is the declining optimism of investors, which is evident in their behavior.
Toncoin Holders Hold Back

Toncoin’s price is experiencing the effect of declining bullishness among investors. The reason behind this is the lack of conviction among TON holders, which was visible in the downtick of the Mean Coin Age.
Mean Coin Age is a blockchain metric that calculates the average age of all coins by considering the time each coin has remained in its current address. It helps gauge the behavior of long-term holders and overall network stability.
The uptick in this indicator shows investors are holding onto their assets while the downtick hints at supply moving around the addresses. TON has noted a downtick since February, but the broader market cues kept increasing Toncoin’s price.

However, with the cues dissipating, the lack of conviction could show its effect on the price action.
But it’s not just the existing investors that are pessimistic; the potential TON holders are not too bullish either. This is evident in the network growth falling to a two-and-a-half-month low. 
Network growth is measured by the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network identified by their participation. It assesses whether the asset is gaining or losing traction in the market.

Since this indicator fell by 70% within a week, potential investors do not have much incentive at the moment. This may be reflected in Toncoin’s price action going forward.
TON Price Prediction: Key Support Level to Watch

Toncoin’s price attempted to breach the resistance of $7.0 but failed to trickle back in the last ten days. Consequently, TON fell below the crucial psychological support level of $6.5. A recent broader market rally pushed the altcoin above this support but could not sustain it, falling to trade at $6.2.
This bearishness will loom over Toncoin’s price unless the investors’ behavior changes. As a result, the cryptocurrency could fall to test the support at $6.0. Losing this support could lead to a dip to $5.4.

However, if Tocnoin’s price does not fall below the $6.0 support level, it could bounce back to $6.5. Flipping it into a support floor would enable recovery, potentially sending TON to $7, invalidating the bearish thesis.

A Deep Dive Into P2P

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
A look at the P2P exchange market and platforms, pros and cons, and more. 
Crypto has become a huge part of our lives over the years, but we still use fiat to pay for most of the services we use in our everyday lives – which means there’s been a demand for easy conversion since the dawn of crypto. 
One of the oldest, most trusted and popular ways to exchange coins to fiat out there is as decentralized as the whole crypto universe itself – it’s P2P, or Peer-to-Peer exchange, where users swap directly with each other.
A Quick P2P Market Overview
The properly decentralized P2P approach contrasts sharply with traditional centralized exchanges, where a single entity controls the order book and facilitates trades. P2P platforms empower users with full control over their transactions by allowing them to agree on terms and execute trades directly with each other. 
One of the defining features of P2P exchanges is their reliance on a network of users instead of a centralized system. This not only enhances privacy and security but also aligns with the foundational principles of blockchain — decentralization and user empowerment. Each participant in a P2P transaction uses software that directly connects them with other participants without needing a middleman, which can reduce fees and increase transaction  transparency.
Moreover, P2P platforms often incorporate sophisticated trust and reputation systems that allow users to rate each other based on their transaction history. This feature helps build a community of trusted users and mitigates the risk of fraud. Additionally, many P2P exchanges provide an escrow mechanism, where the cryptocurrency being traded is held by the platform until both parties confirm that the terms of the transaction have been met. This safeguard reassures users and enhances the reliability of trading on these platforms.
The importance of P2P exchanges has grown in regions where access to traditional banking is limited or where financial regulations restrict the use of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In these areas, P2P platforms offer a vital service, enabling inclusive participation in the global digital economy. Moreover, the adaptability of P2P exchanges allows them to serve a wide array of markets, catering to a diverse user base with varying needs and trading preferences.
Overall, the P2P market continues to expand due to all the perks it offers, and remains the most popular way to exchange crypto, despite other features being introduced by platforms. 
P2P Services: a Quick Overview
P2P platforms are designed to facilitate direct transactions between ordinary users in the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a closer look at some of the core services provided by P2P platforms:

Escrow Services: One of the most critical services offered by P2P platforms is the escrow system. When a trade is initiated, the cryptocurrency is held in escrow by the platform until all parties fulfill their parts of the deal. Only when both the buyer and the seller confirm that the transaction terms have been satisfied does the escrow release the funds. This service significantly reduces the risk of fraud and increases trust among platform users.
Reputation and Rating Systems: To enhance trustworthiness, P2P platforms often incorporate user ratings or reputation systems. Users can rate each other based on their experiences after a transaction is completed. These ratings are then compiled into a comprehensive reputation score for each user, visible to other participants. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about whom they choose to transact with.
Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Despite the best efforts of participants, disputes may still arise. Many P2P platforms have mechanisms for decentralized dispute resolution where neutral arbitrators or the community itself can get involved to adjudicate disagreements based on evidence provided by the transaction parties. This approach not only helps resolve conflicts fairly but also maintains the integrity of the trading environment.
Multi-Currency Support: Most P2P platforms support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, allowing users from different geographic locations to trade in their preferred currencies. This inclusivity enhances the platform’s accessibility and utility, catering to a global audience with diverse needs.
Privacy Protection: In keeping with the ethos of cryptocurrency, P2P platforms typically offer more robust privacy protections compared to centralized exchanges. While users might still need to verify their identity to comply with regulatory requirements, the trading process itself can often be conducted anonymously, with no need for personal information to be exchanged between trading partners.
User-Friendly Interfaces: To attract and retain users, P2P platforms strive to offer clean, intuitive user interfaces that simplify the process of trading digital assets. Whether a novice or an experienced trader, the platform’s design ensures that users can navigate their trading environment effortlessly.


These services make P2P platforms an appealing option for users looking for a more personalized and secure trading experience. By combining the traditional benefits of cryptocurrency, like decentralization and privacy, with innovative trust-building tools, P2P exchanges are setting a new standard in the digital trading space.
A Look at the EMCD P2P Exchange
The EMCD platform stands out in the burgeoning P2P market, especially in Eastern Europe, where it has rapidly become a preferred choice for many cryptocurrency users. EMCD originally gained recognition as one of the top mining pools worldwide but has successfully expanded into the P2P exchange domain. Here’s an in-depth look at the unique features and benefits that EMCD offers:

Mining Pool Integration: EMCD’s roots in cryptocurrency mining provide a distinct advantage. Users who mine cryptocurrencies directly through EMCD can seamlessly exchange their mining rewards on the platform without needing to transfer their assets to another exchange. This integration simplifies the process, reduces transaction fees, and enhances security.
Wide Range of Supported Currencies: The EMCD P2P exchange supports a variety of fiat and cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to the Russian Ruble, Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Kazakhstani Tenge, alongside major cryptocurrencies like USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. This diversity caters to a broad user base and facilitates easier and more flexible trading options across borders. Support for the Georgian lari will be added soon.
Robust Security Measures: Given its background in mining and its established infrastructure, EMCD places a strong emphasis on security. The platform implements advanced security protocols to protect users’ funds and personal information. Regular security audits and compliance with the latest cybersecurity practices ensure that the platform remains secure against potential threats.
User-Friendly Interface: EMCD’s platform is designed with user experience in mind. The interface is intuitive, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced traders. This ease of use is critical in attracting a broader audience and facilitating smooth transactions.
Local and International Bank Integration: EMCD’s integration with local and international banks is a standout feature that simplifies the process of fiat deposits and withdrawals. This service is particularly valuable in Eastern Europe, where users may face challenges with international banking transactions related to cryptocurrency trading.
24/7 Customer Support: EMCD offers round-the-clock customer support to address any issues that users may encounter. Quick and responsive support is essential in the P2P exchange space, where timely assistance can make a significant difference in user satisfaction and trust.
Community and Educational Resources: Understanding the complexities of cryptocurrency trading can be daunting for many. EMCD provides extensive educational resources to help users understand market trends, trading strategies, and the basics of cryptocurrency. Additionally, a strong community presence on platforms like Telegram allows users to engage with peers and experts, fostering a supportive trading environment.
No Regional Restrictions: Unlike some exchanges that limit access based on geographic location, EMCD offers its services without regional restrictions. This inclusivity ensures that users from various jurisdictions can access the platform, trade, and benefit from its services without hindrance.

The combination of these features makes EMCD not just a platform for trading but a comprehensive ecosystem that supports its users’ needs from mining to trading and learning. As the platform continues to evolve, it aims to maintain its commitment to providing secure, accessible, and user-friendly services, solidifying its position as a leading P2P exchange in the cryptocurrency space.
P2P: Pros & Cons
P2P cryptocurrency exchanges represent a significant shift away from traditional financial systems by decentralizing the control over currency trading. This model has several advantages and disadvantages, which are crucial for traders to understand.
Pros:
Decentralization

Direct Transactions: In P2P exchanges, trades occur directly between parties without the need for an intermediary. The platform only facilitates guarantees for transactions, securing them by freezing funds in escrow until the transaction is finalized. 
Personal Responsibility: Users have control over their wallets, which minimizes the risk of losing assets to hacks of platforms.

Privacy and Anonymity

Confidentiality: P2P platforms generally require less personal information from their users, which can provide higher levels of privacy.
Protection from Identity Theft: Reduced sharing of personal details helps protect against identity theft.

Cost Efficiency

No Fees: P2P platforms typically have no fees, since they don’t have to maintain expensive infrastructure or pay intermediaries.
No Middlemen: The absence of middlemen can further reduce transaction costs, making it more economical for users.


Global Access

Inclusive: P2P exchanges can offer services in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or limited, providing more people with access to the cryptocurrency market.
No Geographical Limitations: Users can trade across borders without incurring the high fees usually associated with international transactions.

Flexible Payment Methods

Diverse Payment Options: P2P platforms often support a wide range of payment methods including bank transfers, online wallets, and even cash, making them more accessible.

Cons:
Complexity and Usability

Steep Learning Curve: New users may find P2P platforms more complex and less intuitive than centralized exchanges.
User Responsibility: The need for managing one’s own security can be daunting for some, as P2P does not provide the same level of user support as centralized platforms.

Security Concerns


Scam Risks: While escrow and reputation systems help mitigate risk, scams can still occur. Users must be vigilant and prudent in their dealings.
Dispute Resolution: Resolving disputes can be more complicated without a central authority to adjudicate conflicts.

Liquidity Issues

Variable Liquidity: Depending on the asset and the specific P2P platform, liquidity can be lower than on centralized exchanges, potentially making it harder to complete large transactions quickly.
Price Volatility: Lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility; prices may vary more significantly than on centralized platforms.

Speed of Transactions

Dependency on Participants: Transaction speeds depend on the responsiveness of the counterparty, which can lead to delays if the other party is not prompt.
Manual Processes: The need to manually find and secure trades can slow down the process, especially for less popular assets or payment methods.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Uncertain Regulation: The legal status of P2P trading is still unclear in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks of sudden regulatory changes affecting the ability to trade or withdraw funds.
Compliance Requirements: While anonymity is a benefit, it also places the onus on users to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding taxation and cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion
P2P platforms offer a compelling alternative to traditional and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, especially for those valuing privacy, lower fees, and direct control over their transactions. However, these advantages come with the responsibility of managing one’s own security and the potential for less liquidity and slower trades. 
For many, the benefits of P2P exchanges outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in regions with restricted access to traditional banking services or where users seek to avoid heavy regulation. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the role of P2P platforms is likely to expand, driven by increasing demand for decentralized financial services.

SEC Chair Gensler Criticizes FIT 21 Crypto Bill, Warns Of 'New Regulatory Gaps' - Benzinga

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) would undermine investor protections and hinder the SEC’s regulatory efforts, the financial watchdog’s Chair Gary Gensler stated on Wednesday.What Happened: “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,” Gensler warned.A joint effort by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, FIT21 aims to delineate the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing cryptocurrency. The bill introduces the term “digital commodity” for digital assets not classified as securities, placing them under the CFTC’s jurisdiction.Gensler argued that FIT21 disregards long-standing regulatory precedents for investment contracts and places the SEC in a difficult position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers. He emphasized that the bill overlooks the Supreme Court’s Howey Test precedent, compromises investor protections, and potentially exposes investors to undue risk without adequate disclosures.“U.S. securities laws, developed after the Great Depression, were designed to protect consumers by enforcing disclosures and providing tools for regulators and investors to safeguard customers,” Gensler noted. He pointed out that the crypto industry has been reluctant to comply with these established regulations.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowGensler also criticized the bill for removing investment contracts recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities, thus excluding them from federal securities laws’ protections. He highlighted that this exclusion contradicts court rulings that many crypto assets are offered and sold as securities under existing laws.The bill’s provision allowing companies to self-certify as issuers of “digital commodities” is problematic, Gensler said, because it gives the SEC only 60 days to evaluate whether these assets meet the bill’s criteria—a timeframe he deemed insufficient given the vast number of digital assets in circulation.Gensler also expressed concerns about the bill’s definition of a digital commodity, which he argued ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of assets. He cautioned that the bill’s investor protection framework and the exclusion of exchanges could increase risks to the public.Moreover, Gensler warned that FIT21 might harm the broader U.S. capital markets by enabling companies to circumvent SEC oversight through decentralized networks.The House of Representatives is expected to vote on FIT21 later on Wednesday.However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate and is unlikely to become law this year.What’s Next: For further insights into regulatory developments and their impact on the digital asset space, join industry leaders at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This gathering will delve into the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

Gary Gensler Criticizes FIT21 Crypto Bill Before House Vote


US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly opposed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill to regulate digital asset markets. He believes the bill would weaken the SEC’s ability to protect investors by reclassifying crypto assets and reducing regulatory oversight.
At the same time, The House is set to vote on the bill, which faces notable opposition and an uncertain future in the Senate.
SEC Chair Criticizes FIT21 Act for Reducing Regulatory Oversight

In a Wednesday report, Gary Gensler expressed his strong opposition to the FIT21 Act. The bill, introduced in July 2023 by Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson and backed by several key Republicans, aims to establish clear federal guidelines for digital asset markets. It seeks to balance innovation with strong consumer protections and clarifies the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) roles in regulating cryptocurrency.
Gensler argues that the bill undermines classifying crypto assets as investment contracts. This change would remove these assets from the SEC’s oversight, making it harder to protect investors.
Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?

He noted that FIT21 might enable crypto firms to self-certify their products as “decentralized” digital commodities, thus avoiding SEC scrutiny. Gensler warned that the SEC’s limited resources would hinder its ability to challenge these certifications, leaving much of the crypto market unregulated.
Gensler also criticized the bill’s definition of a digital commodity. He said that it ignores the Howey Test and the economic realities of the assets. Furthermore, he warned that FIT21 could harm the broader US capital markets by allowing companies to evade SEC regulation through decentralized networks.

“The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal securities laws. By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled—but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny—that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law,” Gensler explained.

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), shared his thoughts on Gensler’s stance and current approach to crypto regulation.

“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability,” Alderoty said.

The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday. However, its passage through the Senate remains to be determined. If enacted, the bill would alter the Howey test and significantly reduce the SEC’s oversight of crypto assets. Introduced in 1946, the Howey Test determines if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and, thus, a security.

At least eight House Democrats support the FIT21 Act and may gain more backers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering supporting the bill. Despite no longer being in Democratic leadership, Pelosi’s opinions still influence many House Democrats.
If Pelosi supports the bill, she would go against Ranking Members Democrats Maxine Waters and David Scott, who both oppose it. They express concerns that the bill would result in the mass deregulation of crypto and some traditional securities. They see this deregulation severely undermining US capital markets by removing key protections for investors and consumers.

BeInCrypto previously reported that Waters and Scott urged their colleagues to vote against the bill. However, House Democrats leaders have stated they will not whip against the FIT21 bill. As the debate continues, the vote’s outcome and its implications for the future of US crypto regulation remain uncertain.

Bitcoin Pizza Day: A $700 Million Reminder of Cryptocurrency's Rise


							

Bitcoin Pizza Day marks the first documented Bitcoin transaction, now worth $700 million



Early adopter spent over 100,000 BTC on various goods, missing out on immense potential wealth



Bitcoin, despite bearish sentiment, remains a store of value with a rich and celebrated history




On this day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based software developer, etched his name in history by purchasing two pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This marked the first documented commercial transaction using the original cryptocurrency. Five days before the purchase, Laszlo posted a request on the BitcoinTalk forum, seeking to exchange Bitcoin for pizza.



Today, with Bitcoin trading near $70,000, those two Papa John’s pizzas would be valued at over $700 million. Fourteen years ago, they cost a mere $41. This historic transaction is now commemorated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, a celebration of the cryptocurrency’s remarkable evolution.







In a 2019 interview with journalist Anderson Cooper, Hanyecz reflected on this transaction, noting that dwelling on the immense Bitcoin fortune exchanged for two pizzas would be counterproductive. Beyond the pizzas, Hanyecz made various other purchases with Bitcoin, spending over 100,000 BTC in total. Had he retained this amount, he could have been among the largest Bitcoin holders today.



Despite Bitcoin’s initial conception as a means of payment, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption for this purpose. However, it has thrived as a store of value, with many holders anticipating price appreciation. Recently, CoinEX launched the “One Bite of Bitcoin” campaign on Bitcoin Pizza Day, inviting the global crypto community to join in the festivities.









Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a bearish trend. BTC price has dipped by 1.93%, now trading at $69,764. Additionally, the trading volume has declined by 22.90% to $39.98 billion. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has fluctuated between a high of $71,426.98 and a low of $69,191.12.



The value of the Bitcoins spent on the pizzas is also referred to as the Bitcoin Pizza Index. This index serves as a poignant reminder of Bitcoin’s meteoric growth and its unrealized potential. The community’s celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day underscores the significance of this transaction in the annals of cryptocurrency history.

Is the altcoin season ‘maniac phase’ about to flip on?


    Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record $71,000, followed by a pullback, has set the stage for what many in the cryptocurrency sector believe could signal the onset of an altcoin season.



The coming two weeks are set to be pivotal for the entire altcoin industry. The United States House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



Additionally, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF)  later this week. Speculation about the likely approval of both the FIT21 bill and the spot Ethereum ETFs has been rife, driving increased activity in the crypto markets.







At press time, the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.73 trillion, a 0.45% decrease in the last 24 hours.



Market movements and trends



The cryptocurrency market began the week with strong bullish momentum, led by Ethereum’s (ETH) recent surge to $3,800, which in turn has driven notable gains across major altcoins. 



Historically, Bitcoin initiates market cycles with a robust surge, but significant action typically unfolds during its consolidation phases, where other cryptocurrencies take the lead. 



This trend is expected to become more pronounced in the upcoming period, driven by varying forecasts from leading analysts



Analysts’ insights



Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe observed that the altcoin market cap, referred to as TOTAL2, has completed its recent correction. 







Poppe suggested that the altcoin market cap is well-positioned for a rally to retest its all-time high (ATH). Additionally, most altcoins, led by Ethereum, have broken out of a bullish flag pattern in recent days. 



Another well-known analyst, Rekt Capital, noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level over recent weeks.

According to his analysis, the altcoin market cap is expected to surge to $315 billion before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retracement is projected to be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization.



Investor sentiment



Prominent analyst  advise investors not to panic and to prepare for the upcoming “maniac phase.” Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Yoddha shared that the recent dip was ‘just a higher low in an uptrend.’



According to his analysis, the altcoin market is looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before aiming for the previous cycle’s $1.7 trillion all-time high. He anticipates a bullish continuation leading to a new market all-time high during the next phase.



Contrasting Signals



Despite these optimistic projections, the altcoin season index by Blockchain Center presents a contrasting view. 



According to this index:




“If 75% of the top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days), it is Altcoin Season.” 




Currently, only 37% of the leading 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days, still insufficient to officially declare an altcoin season.



The cryptocurrency market stands at a critical juncture, with significant legislative decisions and market movements on the horizon. 



While many analysts are optimistic about the potential onset of a new altcoin season, contrasting indicators suggest investors should proceed with caution. 



The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of the altcoin market, potentially leading to a ‘maniac phase’ or continued consolidation.

Ripple CLO Advocates For Crypto, Cites US SEC Chairman's Inefficiency | Bitcoinist.com


								Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Ripple Labs has taken a firm stand in support of the cryptocurrency landscape, scathing the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler for his incompetence in overseeing crypto assets.
Ripple CLO Slams Gary Gensler
Today, May 22, Chris Brummer, a professor of Financial Technology at Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial noted that for the first time, the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics.
The SEC chairman Gary Gensler was called out by name by a presidential candidate, which came as a shock to the professor because this has never happened before. Another shocking development highlighted by Brummer was the US president’s Joe Biden threat to veto Congressional legislation regarding the SEC in advance.
The post read:
This is the first time the SEC has become a subject of presidential politics. I don’t recall ever a presidential candidate mentioning the Chair of the SEC by name.  I also don’t remember a sitting President threatening preemptively to veto Congressional legislation about the SEC.
Responding to the professor’s post, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, believes Gensler has overplayed his hand, which led to the development. Rather than promoting a balanced regulatory environment that fosters growth while safeguarding investors, Alderoty argues that Gensler’s approach mistakenly labels crypto innovation as the problem, as he thought it was an easy target.

According to the Ripple CLO, the regulatory watchdog’s chairman enjoys being the person whom everyone loved to despise. Furthermore, Alderoty draws attention to Gensler’s disdain for accountability to Congress, which is essential for efficient regulation. 
Given his status, the Ripple CLO noted that Gensler misunderstood the role of Congressional oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, believing that he was immune to congressional scrutiny. However, with all of that gone, the chairman is now a struggling political liability, suggesting that Gensler is responsible for several problems in the industry.
Alderoty has also addressed Gensler’s unauthorized overreach in the crypto industry. Following the vote against the SEC’s SAB 121 bulletin last week, the CLO stated that the event demonstrated an agreement between the Democrats and Republicans that the chairman’s unlawful crypto overreach will no longer be accepted.
Gensler Sees Heightened Criticism From Top Crypto Figures
Stuart Alderoty is not the only popular crypto figure who has slammed the SEC’s chairman’s inefficient regulation. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency market observer and Cinneamhain Ventures founder Adam Cochran also attacked Gary Gensler over his lack of clarity regarding Ethereum regulations.

Cochran strongly believes that Ethereum is not a security, unlike the SEC, which thinks the asset fails under the securities law. Thus, Cochran insisted that Gensler explain this in court, calling on Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal to make this demand.
This might imply that the founder believes that Gensler might be unable to defend his claims that ETH is a security, asserting that his collapse would be historic.

Base Pro Shops saw the highest gain with a 136% increase. Meme coin leader, Dogecoin (DOGE), is up 5% today and 13% over the past seven days, while Shiba Inu is trading sideways today but has seen an 8% inflow this week.Pepe is Still BullishGiven the increasing demand for PEPE in the market, it can be expected that the token's price will continue to rise, and in the coming days, PEPE's price might increase even further. The token is currently ranked 22nd. If the bullish trend continues, PEPE could become one of the top 20 Cryptocurrencies. Over the past month, PEPE's price has been surging, and this trend is still ongoing. If this trend continues, it could reach a new all-time high again. It is possible that the meme coin could even approach $1 in the future. There are several reasons behind the token's rise, making it a top-performing meme coin.Ethereum ETF Boosts Meme Coin PricesThe main reason for the increase in Meme coin prices is the news of the Ethereum ETF approval. The market expects that the SEC will soon approve the Spot Ethereum ETF. Some market experts even believe that the Ethereum ETF could be approved this month. This anticipation has caused a surge in all Cryptocurrencies, especially Meme Coins.Additionally, the growing trend towards Meme tokens in the Crypto Market and the increasing buzz on social media are also playing a significant role in boosting Meme Coin prices.

Analog Devices Shines in Q2 2024 with Revenue Surpassing Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI) reported its financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, which ended on May 4, 2024, showcasing a robust performance despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. The company reported revenue of $2.16 billion, exceeding its outlook’s midpoint. This performance highlights the resilience of Analog Devices’ business model, even amidst ongoing inventory headwinds. The operating cash flow for the quarter was a significant $4.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $3.1 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis.



Analog Devices also returned over $675 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases during the second quarter. Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair of Analog Devices, emphasized the company’s ability to achieve profitability and earnings per share above the high end of their outlook. Roche noted that the stabilization of inventory rationalization across their broad customer base and improving new orders positions the company well for sequential growth in the upcoming quarters.



Analog Devices Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations with $1.40 Adj. EPS and $2.16 Billion in Revenue for Fiscal Q2



When comparing the actual performance to market expectations, Analog Devices surpassed revenue predictions but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). The market had anticipated an EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $2.1 billion. However, Analog Devices reported an EPS of $0.61, significantly lower than expected, while revenue came in at $2.16 billion, slightly above expectations.



Despite the lower-than-expected EPS, the company’s adjusted EPS was reported at $1.40, which is above the market expectation, indicating strong underlying performance when excluding certain one-time costs and adjustments. The gross margin for the quarter was 54.7%, down from 65.7% in the same quarter last year, reflecting the challenging operating environment. Adjusted gross margin stood at 66.7%, down from 73.7% year-over-year. These figures underscore the operational efficiencies and cost management strategies that Analog Devices has implemented to mitigate external pressures.





Analog Devices Expects Fiscal 2024 Revenue to Be Between $2.17 Billion and $2.27 Billion



Analog Devices provided optimistic guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company forecasts revenue to be around $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of this revenue outlook, the company expects a reported operating margin of approximately 20.1%, with an adjusted operating margin of around 40.0%. This guidance reflects the company’s confidence in its ability to drive growth and profitability in the coming months.



Analog Devices also projected reported EPS to be $0.71, plus or minus $0.10, and adjusted EPS to be $1.50, plus or minus $0.10. This outlook is based on current expectations and takes into account the ongoing economic uncertainties and inventory dynamics.

Ethereum ETF Excitement Sparks Bitcoin and Altcoin Surge


							

Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will surpass its $73,798 record this week.



The potential green light for an Ethereum ETF fuels optimism, driving Bitcoin’s price surge.



Ethereum and memecoins like Pepe and Floki are also experiencing significant gains amidst renewed bullish sentiment.




Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has predicted a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the coming weekend. Kendrick noted in an interview that the flagship crypto would surpass the current $73,798 ATH, achieved on March 14, before the weekend is over.



Citing the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week, the research expert believes it would further legitimize the crypto sector, boosting Bitcoin’s adoption. He asserts that this week’s anticipated new high aligns with his $150,000 target for Bitcoin by year-end and a $200,000 target by December 2025.



Kendrick highlighted the renewed optimism among spot Bitcoin ETF investors, which has invigorated the ecosystem. This has led to increased inflows, bringing the total value to $12.9 billion at the time of the interview. Data from Soso Value shows this figure has since risen to $13.17 billion.



Bitcoin embarked on a significant rally following a recent notice by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting updates to 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum. The SEC’s request signaled potential progress toward an Ethereum ETF approval. It also increased the chances of approval from 25% to 75% based on the crypto industry’s sentiments.









Beyond Bitcoin, many altcoins also rallied, signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment. Pepe and Floki led the memecoin rally, outperforming other cryptocurrencies. Pepe spiked by 59% in the past 48 hours, while Floki gained 30%.



Most notably, Ethereum, the flagship altcoin, broke out of a 5-week range to rally 26% in the past 48 hours. With the surge, Ethereum climbed above multiple resistances, opening the way for retesting this year’s high of $4,093, which it established in March. ETH traded for $3,754 at the time of writing, having retraced slightly from yesterday’s $3,841 high, according to data from TradingView.

Breakneck Growth: Polygon (MATIC) Surpasses 4 Billion Transactions


								Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution aiming to solve the network’s scalability woes, has blasted past a monumental milestone: 4 billion total transactions. This achievement is particularly impressive considering the network launched just four years ago in June 2020. Bitcoin, for comparison, took a staggering 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, highlighting the breakneck speed of Polygon’s adoption.

User Surge Fuels Polygon’s Growth Engine
This meteoric rise isn’t just a vanity metric. The number of daily active users on the network paints a vibrant picture of a thriving ecosystem. Since March 19th, Polygon has boasted a streak of over 60 days with an average of over 1 million daily active users.


This surge in user activity is likely fueled by the popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Polygon. Popular names like Matr1x, a mobile-first play-to-earn game, and Galxe, a burgeoning digital identity network, are attracting users and driving transaction volume.

However, despite this impressive network growth, the price of MATIC, Polygon’s native token, hasn’t mirrored the enthusiasm. Over the past year, MATIC has remained largely range-bound between $0.5 and $1, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market. This disconnect between network activity and token price has some scratching their heads.

Unpacking The MATIC Price Mystery
Analysts offer a few explanations for this price conundrum. As more users flock to Polygon’s dApps, the demand for MATIC, needed to interact with them, should rise in turn. This could lead to a long-term price appreciation for MATIC. However, others point to the sheer volume of tokens in circulation (over 10 billion) as a potential damper on price increases.

Another factor is the competition. While Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling solution, other blockchains like Solana boast even higher transaction volumes (over 290 billion in a similar timeframe).

The Future Of Polygon: A Balancing Act
Despite the current price stagnation, experts remain cautiously optimistic about Polygon’s future. The network’s rapid growth and user adoption are undeniable positives. The team behind Polygon is also actively working on scaling solutions and attracting new dApps to its ecosystem.
If they can successfully navigate the competitive landscape and translate network activity into real value for users, MATIC could finally escape its downward trend and embark on a sustained journey upwards.

Oracle Protocols: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and the Real World - Coin Edition


							

Oracle protocols bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enhancing the functionality of decentralized applications.



Flare Network integrates Oracle capabilities directly into its blockchain, providing a robust environment for advanced smart contracts.



Arthur Hayes highlights the competition among leading oracle protocols, noting Flare’s potential to revolutionize the industry.




Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized nature, thrives on accurate and reliable data. However, to fully leverage its potential, blockchain applications require information from the real world—data typically not available on the blockchain itself. Oracle protocols provide a solution to this challenge, acting as the critical link between off-chain and on-chain data.



What Are Oracle Protocols?



Oracle protocols are specialized software systems that serve as intermediaries between blockchain networks and external data sources. They enable blockchain applications to utilize real-world data, which is essential for decentralized applications (dApps) to operate effectively. Without oracles, blockchains would remain isolated and unable to access external information necessary for various applications.



Oracles retrieve, verify, and transmit data from outside sources to the blockchain securely and reliably. This process is crucial for smart contracts, which depend on accurate and timely data to function correctly. For example, oracles can provide real-time price feeds from traditional markets to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling services like lending, borrowing, and trading based on up-to-date market data.



Furthermore, Oracle Protocols empower dApps to make informed decisions based on real-world events. Whether tracking the condition of goods in a supply chain, determining the outcome of a sports event for a betting platform, or triggering an insurance policy based on weather conditions, oracles connect blockchain technology with real-world data, enhancing the practical application and effectiveness of dApps.



How Oracles Link On-Chain and Off-Chain Data



Oracles facilitate a seamless flow of information between blockchain environments and external data sources. The process begins with an off-chain source, such as a web API, database, or sensor in a connected device. The oracle retrieves this data and verifies its accuracy and reliability through multiple stages to minimize the risk of manipulation or errors.



In decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink, this verification process involves collecting and cross-checking the same data from multiple nodes. These nodes compare their results and reach a consensus before the verified data is transmitted to the blockchain. Financial incentives, such as staking and rewards schemes, align node operators’ interests with the accuracy of the data they provide.









The confirmed data is then relayed to the blockchain, where it can be used by smart contracts and other dApps. This relay process often includes additional security measures to ensure the data remains untampered. Cryptographic methods can secure the data during transmission, and time-stamping techniques ensure the data is current and relevant.



Accuracy and data integrity are paramount in this process. The reliability of smart contracts and dApps depends on the correctness of the data they use. Incorrect or outdated information from an oracle can lead to erroneous contract executions, financial losses, or other unintended outcomes. Therefore, oracles employ rigorous methods to retrieve, verify, and transmit data, ensuring blockchain applications operate as intended and make sound decisions based on the most accurate data.



How Flare Network Uses Oracle Technology



Flare Network is a protocol that integrates smart contract technology with Oracle capabilities. Unlike traditional oracles that provide data to blockchains, Flare incorporates these features directly into its blockchain architecture. This integration creates a robust environment for building and managing smart contracts with reliable data.



Flare’s approach involves validators within its network who are responsible for obtaining and verifying external data, ensuring network integrity, and earning rewards for their contributions. Key components of Flare include the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and the Data Connector. The Data Connector allows Flare to access data from various external sources, including other blockchains and online services, while the FTSO handles time-sensitive data, which is crucial for applications needing real-time information.



By offering these integrated features, Flare facilitates the development of advanced and versatile smart contracts. The network’s ability to gather and process data streams from multiple sources ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the information available, promoting the creation of applications that depend on precise and up-to-date data without additional costs.



Insights from Arthur Hayes



Arthur Hayes, in his article “Igniting the Oracle Wars: Keep an Eye on Flare,” discusses the competition among leading oracle protocols—Chainlink, Pyth, and Flare. As blockchain applications grow more complex, the importance of oracles increases, making this competition critical.



Chainlink, the industry leader, benefits from a robust network and extensive integrations. However, it faces challenges with speed and managing large data volumes, as well as centralized price feed management. Pyth excels in providing rapid, precise price updates, particularly useful for financial applications.



Flare combines the strengths of both Chainlink and Pyth, offering unique features like the Data Connector and FTSO. This integration directly links Oracle services with its smart contract platform, allowing Flare to generate revenue from both data services and smart contracts. Hayes predicts that the protocol that best handles future challenges, such as managing large datasets for AI applications, will dominate the “Oracle Wars.” Although Chainlink currently leads, Flare’s innovative approach and expanding ecosystem position it as a formidable competitor.



Conclusion



Oracle protocols are essential in the blockchain ecosystem. They enable smart contracts to utilize real-world data, thus enhancing the flexibility and utility of decentralized applications. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Oracles will play a crucial role in supporting more sophisticated and diverse applications. Keeping abreast of advancements in Oracle technology is vital, especially with emerging protocols like Flare that have the potential to transform the industry and drive new innovations.

Ethereum ETF Launch Potentially Still Weeks Away, Says Bloomberg Analyst - Benzinga

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Monday pointed out that the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs could be weeks or even longer away, despite recent developments.What Haeppened: At least five potential spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF issuers, including Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin, have filed their amended 19b-4s through CBOE.These amendments primarily involve the removal of staking-related content, emphasizing that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.In his tweet, Seyffart stated, “It’s happening. We have at least 5 of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers that have submitted their Amended 19b-4’s in the last ~25 min. Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE.”Despite these submissions, Seyffart noted that the launch of these ETFs might still be a long way off. “Still a potentially long way from a launch. But these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,” he explained.The only substantial change identified in the revised filings was the removal of staking language. Seyffart said, “This is the only meaningful & substantial change that I can find? Removing the staking language and adding very clear language that the Fund’s ETH cannot be staked by anyone.”Despite these modifications, the approval odds remain at 75%, as highlighted by Seyffart, though he added, “Not that it even means anything anymore haha.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ethereum ETFs Could Drive ‘Mass Adoption’ — What Investors Need To Know NowAdding to the complexity, Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital highlighted the extensive review process the SEC typically undertakes. He explained that the SEC’s review of BTC spot and futures S-1s took several months, suggesting a similar timeline could apply here.Johnsson said, “SEC spent nearly 4 months reviewing and iterating BTC spot S-1s and 5 months reviewing BTC futures S-1s. If Division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they’re likely just getting started. Nothing about this situation is straightforward, so difficult to know how quickly they try to push forward this process.”What’s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.Read Next: SEC Could Approve Spot Ethereum ETF ‘This Week:’ ReportImage: Shutterstock

WisdomTree's Bitcoin, Ethereum ETPs to debut on London Stock Exchange next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.As previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.This move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.With a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree’s upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.Commenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.“While UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,” Marinof stated.“FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty – we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs’ prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,” he added.WisdomTree’s commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.The firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.In March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.[Update with context in the second paragraph]

GameStop Price Crashes, Buy The Dip Or Sell GME? This Solana Meme Coin ICO Raises / Cryptonews
                        Just over one week on from legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return to social media for the first time since 2021, the GameStop (GME) price has crashed, with retail investors asking whether now might be the time to buy the dip or sell GME.The GameStop price rallied as high as $65 last Tuesday but has since crashed back to $22.That leaves it barely 20% above its levels from before Roaring Kitty’s return.Roaring Kitty was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock craze, during which time GME was a leading stock.The 2021 meme stock craze was viewed by many as a retail investor-led movement against Wall Street hegemony.Hopes remain high amongst retail investors that Roaring Kitty’s return could catalyze a new meme stock season.US Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy even announced on Monday that he had invested $24,000 in GME.But macro conditions likely don’t warrant a repeat of 2021 meme stock mania.The US government isn’t currently handing out stimulus cheques.And while US equity markets are pushing on to new record highs, interest rates remain at multi-decade highs.Recent years of inflation plus high interest rates have put a major squeeze on retail investor spending firepower.Also, there is good reason to be bearish on the GameStop price. GME is an inflationary asset – the company last week announced a new stock sale.Meanwhile, the company continues to run at a loss and cut jobs as it struggles with e-commerce competitors.GME Investors Should Instead Consider Meme Coins 
Traders looking to make speculative bets on assets that could see huge market hype-driven gains can do better than GME.As noted above, the outlook for the GameStop price isn’t necessarily good as it has bad fundamentals and is inflationary.Its also got a bloated market cap of around $6.5 billion.For a company that probably isn’t worth anything in real life, that’s potentially a very large overvaluation.And that reduces the likelihood of anything more than 5x gains this bull cycle.Traders considering GME should instead consider crypto meme coins.Top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe are likely to continue to grow as crypto technology is adopted.However, their bloated market caps suggest that they also have limited room for upside.Luckily, new meme coins are popping up every day. While most are scams or pump-and-dumps, savvy traders may be able to uncover hidden 100x gems.One such coin that analysts at Cryptonews are very bullish on is Solana meme coin ICO Sealana (SEAL).Sealana (SEAL) – The Best Solana Meme Coin ICO Right Now
South Park-themed Seal cartoon character Sealana has been generating huge excitement since launching its presale.The new Solana meme coin ICO features an overweight, Solana meme coin trading degen seal called Sealana.The loveable seal mascot has already attracted over $2.35 million in funds from early investors.Strong demand is no surprise given the strong traction Sealana has been getting across socials.Sealana has already garnered over 5,000 X followers, as well as over 5,000 on Telegram.Sealana’s marketing and presale success is reminiscent of the recently launched Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH).Slothana raised over $15 million in a similar presale. However, it then went on to pump to a market cap of over $100 million, as per DEXTools.Presale investors were up over 5x within just a few days of the token’s launch. That more than could likely be expected from the GameStop price in the near future.SLOTH also just launched on the top-ten crypto exchange HTX. This could lead to a new push higher in its price as new retail investors flood in.Amid rumors that the Slothana and Sealana teams are related, traders will hope SEAL’s success matches SLOTH’s.If Sealana can quickly secure exchange listings post-launch like SLOTH, it could easily be the best new Solana meme coin ICO to buy right now.Investors can buy their SEAL by connecting their web3 wallet on Sealana’s official website with SOL, ETH, USDT, or USDC. Sealana is also available for purchase via card.Buy Sealana Here

Bitcoin Price Alert: 273,000 BTC Held at Key Bitcoin Supply Range

As Bitcoin teeters near $70,000, analysts are closely watching a critical supply zone for the largest cryptocurrency. This range is crucial because it represents a key area where a substantial amount of Bitcoin was acquired.Crypto analyst Ali has identified a key supply zone for Bitcoin, situated between $70,180 and $70,600, where over 450,000 addresses have collectively acquired approximately 273,000 BTC.  The supply zone is an important area on the price chart that often acts as a barrier to upward price movements. It is where a large number of Bitcoin was previously bought, and holders may look to break even or take profits, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. Following a steady rebound from May 1 lows of $56,500, Bitcoin reached highs of $71,980 on May 21 before encountering resistance. At the time of writing, BTC was sustaining its declines from the prior day, down 1.91% in the last 24 hours to $69,998. Potential scenariosAs Bitcoin approaches the highlighted critical supply zone, several scenarios could unfold:If Bitcoin manages to break above the $70,600 level with strong volume, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend. This would likely attract additional buyers, pushing the price higher and potentially establishing a new support level.On the other hand, if Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure within this range, it could lead to a price rejection and subsequent pullback. This scenario would indicate that many holders want to realize profits, resulting in temporary resistance.Another possibility is that Bitcoin consolidates below this range for a while. This would imply a balance between buyers and sellers ahead of a major price movement.As Bitcoin considers its next move, price behavior around the $70,000 mark would be closely watched given the sheer volume of BTC accumulated in this area. Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, Ali believes that if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC peak before a temporary drop around $77,593.

								Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to approve these funds. Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week. 
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence 
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take “weeks to months” for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively. 

Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas predict that the SEC will likely approve at least VanEck’s application on or before May 23 since this is the final deadline for the Commission to decide on it. Before now, the SEC was expected to deny these applications, mainly because there were reports that it considered Ethereum a security. 
However, Balchunas revealed in an X post that the Commission had become willing to approve these funds due to an “increasingly political issue.” The SEC has already shown a willingness to approve these funds, having informed Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to update their filings.
Insiders have also claimed that the SEC’s feedback to these exchanges is a positive signal and shows that the regulator might be ready to approve these investment funds. Steven McClurg, the head of US asset management for CoinShares, also told Reuters that it could take months for the Ethereum ETFs to begin trading since, unlike the exchange filings, there is no set timeframe for the SEC to approve the registration filings.  
However, the SEC has shown that it can approve both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings simultaneously, just like it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which immediately went live thanks to this. The only difference between then and now is that the SEC constantly communicated with the issuers weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. 
Fidelity And Grayscale Remove Staking Plans From Ethereum Spot ETFs
Asset managers Fidelity and Grayscale have removed their staking plans in their updated S1-filings. This was expected, considering that the staking feature is a huge part of why the SEC is rumored to consider ETH a security. However, removing this staking offering again suggests that the SEC will approve these funds as long as ETH staking isn’t included. 

Meanwhile, Seyffart noted in an X post that their approval odds still stand at 75% since the removal of the staking plans was expected.  
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,700, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Analyst Alex Krüger Revises Ethereum Outlook Amid SEC Rumors | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 21 May 2024, prominent macroeconomist and crypto analyst Alex Krüger provided new insights on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) regarding the potential for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Ethereum ETFs. Krüger, who founded the asset management and advisory firm Aike Capital, offered a detailed analysis reflecting the rapidly changing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.



Until this week, Krüger had been pessimistic about the likelihood of the SEC approving any spot Ethereum ETFs this year or soon. However, recent developments have prompted a reevaluation. On 20 May 2024, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart significantly increased their estimated odds of SEC approval for spot ETH ETFs from 25% to 75%. This adjustment was based on emerging rumors suggesting that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance, driven by political considerations.



Balchunas shared the updated odds on X, noting that the shift was fueled by afternoon chatter indicating a possible reversal in the SEC’s approach to this increasingly politicized issue. This unexpected development has caused market participants to scramble to adjust their positions, many of whom had previously assumed that ETF approvals would be denied.







In his analysis, Krüger acknowledged the potential impact of these rumors. He stated that his base case scenario had been:



Bitcoin rising significantly by the end of the year.Ethereum underperforming due to the expected rejection of spot ETH ETF proposals by the SEC.Ethereum outperforming post the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024, driven by a potential change in SEC leadership and subsequent approval of spot ETH ETFs in 2025.



However, the possibility of an SEC approval, possibly as early as this week, could accelerate these timelines. Krüger emphasized that the market had not fully priced in such an approval, suggesting that Ethereum could see a substantial rally if the approval were granted.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Krüger explained that the current market movements were primarily driven by repositioning and the closing of short positions, as the possibility of an SEC approval caught many off guard. He predicted that if approval were granted, it would lead to significant inflows into Ethereum, potentially pushing its price to all-time highs (ATHs).



He cautioned against underestimating the potential for approval, highlighting that such a decision could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and cause Ethereum to lead the market. Despite the day’s rally, he pointed out that ETH/BTC was still down year-to-date, indicating room for further growth.







Krüger also touched on the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He suggested that the seeming shift in the SEC’s approach might be politically driven, possibly influenced by the upcoming elections and the need to counteract former President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance.



He noted that if the SEC rejects the spot ETH ETF proposals, which he now views as unlikely, the market could experience significant pain. He advised traders to stay alert and monitor developments closely until the SEC’s decision on May 23rd.







Krüger also delvec into the political dynamics influencing the SEC’s stance. He posits that the seeming change in the SEC’s approach may be driven by top Democratic party members, potentially influenced by the upcoming elections. He believes this shift could be a reaction to former President Donald Trump’s recent support for cryptocurrency, forcing a strategic move from the Democrats to not appear anti-crypto.

                        The Bonk price has risen by almost 1% today, reaching $0.00003187 as the wider crypto market drops by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.BONK is now up by 31% in a week and by 54% in a month, with the Solana-based meme token also up by a whopping 7,900% in a year.And these gains come at a time when prominent trader TheCryptoDog has suggested that attention is turning to BONK, presaging a possible rally in the near future.Bonk Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader TheCryptoDog Says BONK is About to Rally – Time to Buy?
Bonk is showing some signs of a minor correction after the surging of the past couple of days, with its indicators reflecting a dip in momentum.In particular, its RSI (purple) has declined from 85 on Sunday/Monday almost 50 today, with the coin having plenty of room to slip further before becoming decidedly oversold.Source: TradingViewHaving said that, its other indicators don’t seem too bad, with its 30-day average (orange) still rising steadily beyond the 200-day average (blue), even if it isn’t rising quite as steeply today.What’s particularly positive is that BONK’s volume remains high at just over $800 million, up from $180 million only a few days ago.Also bullish are BONK’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are both rising in parallel, suggesting that the coin will trade within a consistently rising band.Much of the coin’s increased volume has come from renewed interest from whales, as recent data indicates.Such interest could continue for a while yet, with the wider market looking as though it’s entering a new bull phase.This is largely because the SEC looks ready to approve several spot-based Ethereum ETFs, with the deadline for a batch coming tomorrow.While any approval will not directly affect BONK, it will at least boost market-wide bullishness, thereby helping the Bonk price.And for some traders, BONK looks likelier than many other meme tokens to rally in the very near future.This is the opinion of TheCryptoDog, for instance, who has recently posted on X that the coin seems to be attracting more interest than many of its rivals.As such, we may see the Bonk price reach $0.000035 in the next few weeks, before potentially returning to its ATH of $0.00004547 by Q4.New Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Rallies
Bonk does look ready to surge in the near future, yet it’s not the only Solana-based meme token with good potential right now.There are also a range of presale tokens that are gaining hype and momentum, with some of these likely to perform very well once they list.A prime candidate is Sealana (SEAL), a new meme coin that has raised just over $2.3 million in its increasingly popular sale.Aiming to follow in the footsteps of BONK, WIF and other out-performing Solana-based meme coins, SEAL is already attracting a sizeable following online.This is partly thanks to its meme stylings, with the token adopting a gun-toting yet amiable seal as its anthropomorphic mascot.One interesting feature of Sealana is that it will actually be a multi-chain meme coin, with an Ethereum version of the token already live.Given the early success of its presale, it’s likely to enjoy a big listing once it launches in the next few weeks.In the meantime, investors can still buy it via its presale by going to the official Sealana website.It’s available at a conversion rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly worth $0.026 per token.VIDEOIt may quickly supersede such a price once it goes live, potentially turning itself into a rival of BONK and other SOL-based coins.Buy SEAL Today

Kangamoon presale nears 7M as Uniswap (UNI) price jumps on response to SEC's Wells Notice - CoinJournal



                    

                    
The robust rebuttal from Uniswap against the SEC’s allegations has sent shockwaves through the crypto market.
The price of Uniswap (UNI) surged to a high of $9.67 following the news of the tough response.
As UNI price rises, another new altcoin Kangamoon (KANG) is also making waves as its presale nears $7M.

The Uniswap (UNI) price is soaring following Uniswap Labs’ formidable response to the SEC’s Wells Notice. Although the token has slightly pulled back, it surged by more than 30% immediately after the news of the response broke.
The response has not only bolstered investor confidence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector but also ignited positive sentiment for other altcoins, notably Kangamoon (KANG), which is currently in the midst of its presale.
The 40-page response to SEC’s Wells Notice
Uniswap Labs filed a comprehensive 40-page response to the SEC’s Wells Notice, vehemently contesting the agency’s claims that Uniswap’s operations may violate US securities laws.
The decentralized crypto exchange argued against potential lawsuits, urging the SEC to reconsider its stance. Uniswap refuted the SEC’s assertions, labeling them as “weak” and citing court rulings that contradicted the agency’s legal arguments.
Moreover, Uniswap challenged the SEC’s expansive interpretation of securities laws, emphasizing that the agency’s allegations were based on unreasonable extensions of key definitions such as securities, exchanges, and contracts.
The platform also highlighted that the majority of its trading volume did not involve securities, as per the SEC’s own standards, and that most of its users were from outside the US, potentially exempting them from US securities laws.
The new meme coin making waves alongside Uniswap (UNI)
As Uniswap continues its legal battle with the SEC, another project, Kangamoon, is making waves in the crypto space with its unique approach to meme coins and community engagement.
Kangamoon aims to establish itself as a prominent meme coin while integrating elements of SocialFi and Play To Earn (P2E).
The project promises an immersive gaming experience where players can earn rewards in the form of $KANG tokens and exclusive NFTs by participating in challenges and competitions.
Currently in its presale phase, Kangamoon has already raised a significant amount of nearing the $7 million mark.
Notably, the presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire $KANG tokens at a favorable price before the official launch of the platform. It has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts alike, drawn to its innovative concept and potential for community-driven growth.
Participants in the Kangamoon presale can look forward to claiming their tokens once the presale concludes.
The project’s team has assured that detailed instructions for token claiming will be provided through various channels, including the official website, social media platforms, newsletters, and Telegram.
Conclusion
The surge in Uniswap (UNI) price following Uniswap Labs’ response to the SEC’s Wells Notice has injected optimism into the cryptocurrency market, benefiting projects like Kangamoon whose presale is underway.
As both crypto projects navigate regulatory challenges and strive for success, they exemplify the resilience and innovation inherent in the crypto space.

DOT Explodes Above $7.5 but Watch This Metric Closely: Polkadot Price Analysis


																Polkadot has recently witnessed a surge in demand, leading to a price uptick that has breached its previous swing high and broken through a multi-month descending trendline. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of its consolidation range and is on the brink of surpassing it.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A detailed analysis of Polkadot’s daily chart shows that after a prolonged phase of sideways consolidation, a renewed spike in demand has pushed the price higher. This surge has allowed Polkadot to break through several key resistance levels, including a descending multi-month trendline, the prior swing high of $7.47, and the 200-day moving average.
Now, the price is approaching the upper boundary of this long-standing range and is on the verge of breaking above it.
If the buyers manage to push above this range, it could signal the beginning of a sustained bullish trend. However, if selling pressure intensifies, a bearish reversal towards the lower boundary is possible. The price action around this crucial resistance zone will determine Polkadot’s short-term trajectory.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
In the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot’s recent bullish momentum is more evident, with the price experiencing a 12% impulsive spike towards a significant resistance area.
This critical range is bounded by the 0.5 ($7.415) and the 0.618 ($7.821) Fibonacci levels. Nevertheless, the price has been fluctuating within an ascending wedge pattern for an extended period, and following the recent surge in demand, it is now slightly retracing towards its upper boundary.
If the buyers can breach the substantial resistance at $7.8, the next target will be the upper boundary of the wedge in the mid-term.
Conversely, a bearish reversal could lead to another downward move, aiming for the wedge’s lower boundary. A decisive breakout from the wedge pattern is necessary to determine Polkadot’s upcoming direction.
Source: TradingView
Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot’s price has recently experienced a notable surge, raising expectations of a potential mid-term bullish trend. Hence, analyzing the futures market sentiment is crucial to assess whether this uptrend will persist, as futures market positions are significant drivers of volatility.
This chart illustrates the funding rate and open interest metrics alongside Polkadot’s daily price movements. Despite the recent bullish surge, both open interest and funding rates have not shown a significant increase and remain near their lowest levels. This suggests that the recent price action was not driven by increased bullish activity in the perpetual markets.
While Polkadot’s price has surged, the sustainability of this uptrend depends on the futures market sentiment. If open interest and funding rates begin to rise, it will signal strong bullish momentum, potentially solidifying the uptrend. Conversely, if these metrics remain low, the uptrend may lack the necessary support for long-term continuation. Traders should closely watch these indicators to better understand the market’s direction in the coming weeks.

AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2024


    With many assets in the cryptocurrency sector starting to stagnate after recent bullish price action, the same is happening to XRP, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further improvements for this crypto asset in the following several months.



As it happens, XRP has halted its bullish advances from the previous days and has dropped back below the previously surpassed critical price level at $0.53, demonstrating the beginning of a consolidation noticeable in other assets in the crypto market as well.



XRP price prediction



Specifically, one of the popular AI algorithms, which takes into account historical XRP price movements, technical analysis (TA) indicators, chart patterns, and other relevant factors, has set the price of XRP on August 1, 2024, at $0.384764, which would suggest a drop of 27.29% from its current price.







3-month XRP price prediction. Source: CoinCodex



Elsewhere, the newest model of the OpenAI invention ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, has set the price of XRP for August 1, 2024, in the range of $1.24 – $3.30, taking into account both “median expert expectations [and] bullish predictions and favorable legal outcomes,” as well as supply, demand, and market dynamics. 



Additionally, the recent Anthropic AI model, Claude 3 Opus, has offered the XRP price prediction in the range of $0.838 – $2.23 by August 2024, considering “market dynamics, regulatory developments, and the outcome of Ripple’s legal case” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Notably, it has also explained that Ripple’s strategic partnerships could positively affect the acceptance of XRP and, with it, the token’s price action:




“Ripple has established partnerships with numerous banks and financial institutions, indicating growing adoption and integration of XRP into mainstream financial systems.”




XRP price analysis



Currently, XRP is changing hands at $0.52919, suggesting a decline of 2.19% in the last 24 hours but still recording an increase of 4.24% across the previous seven days and yet accumulating a drop of 1.08% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 22.

Earlier, crypto analyst Maximus Prime observed that XRP recently encountered rejection at the symmetrical trendline, a critical resistance level, stressing that XRP will have to “fight its way back into it and hold above,” adding that the two-week chart presented a bearish outlook but that bulls were still trying.







At the same time, EGRAG Crypto highlighted that XRP was showing “inclining steps to the upside” – a bullish sign visible “even if you’re not a chart analyst” – and a “solid trajectory” with the next pivotal target at $0.75, projecting consolidation followed by a pump and “the grand finale” in an X post on May 21.

All things considered, AI and experts’ bullish XRP predictions might be correct, but doing one’s own research, weighing the risks, and keeping up with any relevant XRP news and Ripple news is critical before investing a significant amount of money in this token, as trends can change.

SEC's tough stance on crypto continues: Gary Gensler slams 'FIT 21' Act - AMBCrypto



Gary Gensler has opposed the “FIT 21” Act, citing regulatory gaps and risks to investors.
SEC’s crypto stance before the 2024 elections could majorly sway voter sentiment.

As former President Donald Trump starts accepting crypto donations for his 2024 presidential campaign, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has voiced his opposition against the crypto market bill.
Gensler’s sudden move 
In a statement released on the 22nd of May, Chair Gary Gensler publicly voiced his opposition to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21” Act).
The FIT 21 Act is a U.S. legislation aimed at promoting the development of new financial instruments and technologies while establishing a framework for their regulation and oversight.
Gensler stated,
“Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT 21”) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”
He further added,
“The bill allows issuers of crypto investment contracts to self-certify that their products are a ‘decentralized’ system and then be deemed a special class of ‘digital commodities’ and thus not subject to SEC oversight.”
Such a strong stance by the SEC Chair ahead of the 2024 presidential election has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community.
Crypto enthusiasts unhappy 
Underlining the unprecedented involvement of the SEC in presidential politics, journalist Chris Brummer took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted,
Source: Chris Brummer
Echoing a similar line of thought, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said,
“Gensler overplayed his hand. He thought crypto was an easy target. He relished being the guy that everyone loved to hate.”
He further went on and opined,
“He thought he was above Congressional oversight. That’s all gone. He’s now a struggling political liability.”
In a separate earlier interview, SEC Chair Gary Gensler voiced his frustration over the “outsized ratio” of crypto-related inquiries compared to those about traditional finance.
“Crypto is a small piece of our overall markets. But, it’s an outsized piece of the scams and frauds and problems in the markets.”
Impact on the upcoming elections 
These developments might have a significant impact on President Joe Biden’s position in the upcoming election.
His administration’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency, as reflected in Chair Gensler’s regulatory approach, contrasts sharply with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves.
Hence, the difference in their approaches may sway voters, especially those supportive of cryptocurrencies.

Probe finds Effective Ventures charity acted ‘diligently’ after FTX collapse


A UK government inquiry into an FTX-backed charity that received $26.8 million in donations, has concluded that its trustees acted ‘quickly’ and ‘diligently’ protecting the charity’s funds in the wake of the crypto exchange’s high-profile collapse. 
In 2022, Effective Ventures Foundation (EV) filed a Serious Incident Report with the Charity Commission, informing it that FTX, one of the charity’s major funders, had filed for bankruptcy amid reports of criminal activity. It also informed the commission that the CEO of FTX Foundation and an unpaid advisor to the FTX Future Fund made up two of EV’s trustees.
The commission subsequently launched a probe to determine ‘the extent of any risk to the charity’s assets and the extent to which the trustees were complying with their legal duties’ and to investigate ‘the governance and administration of the charity by the trustees, including relationships between the charity’s trustees and its funders and the identification and management of conflicts of interest.’
The investigation, which concluded with the publication of the commission’s report, revealed that EV trustees effectively ‘ringfenced’ its FTX funding of £3.3 million and $300,000 by informing the National Crime Agency that its FTX donated funds may be criminal as to avoid any money laundering offenses. 
The UK and US arms of EV also agreed to pay FTX a total of $26.8 million in 2022. The charity recently also listed for sale Wytham Abbey, the manor house that it bought with a £17 million ($21.5 million) grant in 2021.
EV bought the 15th-century manor using a £17 million grant unrelated to FTX.

The report also found that the charity excluded the two FTX-linked trustees from any decisions and discussions relating to the FTX bankruptcy, labeling them ‘non-participating’ trustees. The inquiry noted that there was a ‘lack of clarity’ around whether the FTX-linked trustees were acting for the charity or on behalf of FTX Foundation at any given time.
It stressed, however, that there was “no evidence” to suggest any unmanaged conflicts of interest or that the FTX-linked trustees acted against EV’s interests. The two reportedly resigned during the inquiry. 
The inquiry concluded, “Trustees acted diligently and quickly in assessing the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect their assets and continued operations.” It added that despite “highlighted weaknesses within the charity and its governance the trustees sought to put these things right at the earliest opportunity.”

Trump Accepting Crypto Donations In The US Election


                                Donald Trump's Strategic Move In the US Election                                What’s The NewsAll the candidates are putting in maximum effort for their campaigns for the US presidential election to be held in November. Current president and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden is using safety and work record as his main tools in his campaign to secure victory. Meanwhile, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has made a bold move by announcing that he will accept cryptocurrency donations for his election campaign thereby changing the entire direction of the US election. According to information collected by CoinGabbar, a notice was issued yesterday stating that the Trump 2024 Campaign has launched a fundraising page using the Coinbase Commerce product, allowing eligible individuals to donate in crypto. The website features logos of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, USD Coin, Solana, and ZRX.  According to the information, Elon Musk is considering Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as the better investment option.It's worth noting that Donald Trump recently held a dinner for those who bought NFTs featuring his mugshot from the time he surrendered at the Georgia jail. During this event, he asked his supporters to donate to his campaign in cryptocurrency.The president's support is a big boost for the US crypto industry which has ramped up lobbying efforts and has spent millions on the upcoming 2024 elections. This has become a new focus area for Trump to continue bashing Biden. He also disagreed with the administration’s stance on the matter, pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been aggressively antagonistic towards crypto companies for failing to register with the agency. “The Democrats are very much against it,” Trump stated.Cryptocurrency Becomes The Center Of Attraction Amid US ElectionCryptocurrency has become the center point of the US presidential election. The two parties have different views on cryptocurrency. Democratic Party candidate and current President Joe Biden has never shown support for cryptocurrency.  Actions and investigations by the SEC against crypto exchanges during his tenure indicate that he does not consider cryptocurrency favorable. On the other hand, potential Republican candidate Donald Trump has shown a positive attitude toward crypto since the beginning of his campaign. He has also deemed the SEC investigations into crypto exchanges as wrong. Trump aims to directly connect with the crypto community by accepting cryptocurrencies as donations for his campaign. For your information, about 50% of the young population in the US are crypto investors. Trump's target is to connect with this demographic directly. If the crypto community supports Trump in the presidential election, his victory could be assured. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's indifferent attitude towards crypto continues to widen the gap between him and the crypto community, which could be a significant disadvantage for him in the election.Also Read: First-Ever Standalone Crypto Legislation By The U.S.

Tether mints another $1 billion USDT this week; Is a market pump ahead?


    Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, fueling speculation about a potential market surge. 



This development coincides with the crypto community’s anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on a spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF), expected later this week.







Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, clarified on X (formerly Twitter) that this issuance was for “inventory replenishment” and was an “authorized but not issued transaction.”







This means the tokens will be used as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps, but are not yet in circulation. This move is viewed by market analysts as a strategic preparation for a potential market rally fueled by the expected approval of an ETH ETF.



Ivan Sherbakov, CEO of Cryptorobotics, speculated that  this influx of liquidity will be used to pump the market ahead of ETF news.







Historically, an increase in USDT supply has been linked with broader upward trends in the crypto market, leading to increased trading volumes and a more vibrant digital asset environment.



Tether’s market impact



As of May 22, Tether’s Transparency page shows $87.8 million worth of these USDT tokens on Ethereum. Tether’s market cap has grown significantly over the past year, exceeding $111 billion and accounting for roughly 70% of the stablecoin market. 



This growth has been driven by various factors, including the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and Tether’s diversification into areas like Bitcoin mining.



Concerns and considerations



Despite the positive market implications, some analysts have expressed concerns about Tether’s lack of transparency. Deutsche Bank analysts have highlighted potential risks associated with Tether’s significant market dominance.



With the total stablecoin market capitalization exceeding $160.9 billion, Tether holds a significant share. 



These transparency issues and market dominance continue to be debated among analysts and investors, even as Tether’s actions could trigger significant market movements if the ETF is approved.

Bitcoin key support and resistance levels to watch for a possible breakout


    Bitcoin (BTC) revisited the $70,000 price zone in a bullish seven days, powered by macroeconomic indicators and overall positive sentiments in the cryptocurrency market. Finbold looked for insights on key support and resistance levels to watch for in the last week of May.



Notably, Bitcoin has been trading in a well-defined range since March, from $60,000 to $72,000. During this time, BTC has made two brief deviations—of two days each—from the price range. One in mid-March made an all-time high at $73,805, and the other in early May flash-crashed to $56,590.



Therefore, the $60,000 and the $72,000 levels remain the most important support and resistance to watch for. A breakout, followed by confirmation with increased volume, from any of these levels would bring a more aggressive move.







In the meantime, the $70,000 price makes a relevant psychological resistance that Bitcoin is currently testing. Moreover, the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) has also been a key level, now making support at $65,200/btc.

Bitcoin on-chain data for key support and resistance levels



Looking further, Finbold gathered on-chain data from IntoTheBlock on May 22, which highlights other key levels to watch for.



In particular, the “In/Out of the Money Around Price” metric shows strong support at lower prices than current ones. The largest volume is within the $63,728 to $65,830 level, at an average of $64,689. 1.79 million addresses purchased over 953,260 BTC at these prices and are currently in profit.



On the other hand, there is no relevant volume to the upside, suggesting weaker resistance to the range’s top for BTC at above $72,000.

Is Bitcoin ready for new all-time highs?



In this context, Finbold checked Bitcoin’s “Market Value To Realized Value” (MVRV) Ratio of the last 90 days on Santiment.



MVRV shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every coin acquired. Essentially, higher ratios surge in potential resistance, foreshadowing increased selling activity, while the opposite is also valid to form support.



As of this writing, the 90-day MVRV ratio at 6% suggests a neutral outlook, with weak resistance at $70,000. Nevertheless, these prices have a proportionally low ratio compared to the 35% seen in March.



Hence, Bitcoin might make new all-time highs in the following days or weeks.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s key support and resistance levels to watch are $60,000, $64,690, $70,000, and $72,000. The support levels are stronger than the resistance, which suggests a breakout to the upside. It is important, however, to understand that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile digital assets, and indicators are not conclusive.
