Bitcoin is set to snap its seven-month growth streak.
-----------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin (BTC) dipped as low as $59,500 on Binance ahead of tomorrow’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Market participants are bracing for a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve (Fed), with expectations set for unchanged interest rates.

The CME FedWatch Tool [indicates](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) a mere 4.4% of economists predict a rate cut—the first in over a decade—while a dominant 95.6% anticipate rates to hold steady between 525-550 basis points.

According to The Kobeissi Letter, current market data indicates a 36% probability that there will be no interest rate cuts this year. Four months ago, the likelihood of maintaining current rates was only about 3%.

Expectations have also shifted to just one reduction this year. Previously, the market anticipated six rate cuts. Additionally, the probability of experiencing two or more rate cuts has diminished to 31%.

&gt; You can't make this up:
&gt; 
&gt; Prediction markets now show a 36% chance of ZERO interest rate cuts in 2024, according to [@Kalshi](https://twitter.com/Kalshi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).
&gt; 
&gt; To put this in perspective, 4 months ago there was a ~3% chance of no rate cuts in 2024.
&gt; 
&gt; The base case has gone from 6 rate cuts to 1 rate cut this year.… [pic.twitter.com/mTQMDAz99K](https://t.co/mTQMDAz99K)

Stagflation risk
----------------

Amidst this financial climate, the US grapples with stagflation risks as inflation persists and economic growth slows.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The first quarter of 2024 saw GDP growth decelerate to 1.6%, falling short of the 2.2% forecast and down from the previous quarter’s 3.4%. Concurrently, the US Core PCE inflation index climbed from 2.0% to 3.7%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that recent data does not make the Fed more confident, suggesting a longer timeline to regain economic stability. He expressed belief in the adequacy of current policies to navigate the risks at hand, hinting at sustained high-interest rates without increases.

Bitcoin’s trajectory mirrored these economic uncertainties, dropping below $62,000 earlier in the week [due to renewed stagflation worries](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-market-stagflation-fears/).

A brief rally above $64,000 occurred with [the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong](https://cryptobriefing.com/hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-expectation/) yesterday, but the momentum was short-lived as investor caution set in ahead of the Fed’s key decision.

Slowdown in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows
------------------------------------

The market also observed a notable slowdown in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) pausing new inflows for several days—a first since its debut. Meanwhile, other funds have seen continued outflows, including Grayscale Investments.

Bitcoin’s price has been static since [the fourth halving event](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-fourth-halving-event/). According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is currently trading at around $60,100, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, and will likely end its continuous growth streak, which has lasted since last September.

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/228907/fka-twigs-ai-deepfakes-digital-replicas-senate-hearing

Published Time: 2024-05-01T01:31:41

Markdown Content:
Artificial intelligence was again the hot topic of the day in Washington D.C., as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee heard [testimony](https://www.c-span.org/video/?535268-1/senate-hearing-digital-replicas-ai-concerns&amp;live) from the music industry, unions, and academia about the risks presented by generative AI. The session focused largely on AI-powered digital replicas and deepfakes—with one musician sharing her own experiences with the tech.

Copyright and free speech protections were also central themes covered by a variety of guests, including Robert Kyncl, CEO of Warner Music Group, SAG-AFTRA director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, University of San Diego School of Law professor Lisa Ramsey, Digital Media Association (DiMA) CEO Graham Davis, and former NBC Universal senior counsel Ben Sheffner.

British actor and musician “FKA Twigs,” whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, spoke first-hand about how AI could affect artists.

“We dedicate a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice in the pursuit of excellence—not only in the expectation of achieving commercial success and critical acclaim, but also in the hope of creating a body of work and reputation that is our legacy,” FKA Twigs told the committee. “I'm here because my music, my dancing, my acting, the way my body moves in front of the camera, and the way that my voice resonates for a microphone is not by chance. They are essential reflections of who I am.”

FKA Twigs, 36, will star in the upcoming 2024 reboot of “The Crow.” She emphasized the hard work that goes into perfecting an artist’s craft, aiming to create a sustaining foundation and a lasting legacy, and not just fame.

“Let me be clear, I am not against AI,” she said. “As a future-facing artist, new technologies are an exciting tool that can be used to express deeper emotions, create fantasy worlds, and touch the hearts of many people.”

FKA Twigs then told the committee that she created a digital replica of herself.

“In the past year, I have developed my own deepfake version of myself that is not only trained in my personality, but that can also use my exact tone of voice to speak many languages,” she said, noting that it can help her reach a more global fanbase and hone her marketing while she focuses on her craft.

“This, however, is all under my control, and I can grant or refuse consent in a way that is meaningful,” she noted.

Consent and fair compensation were key factors in the [SAG-AFTRA strike](https://decrypt.co/205299/sag-aftra-ends-strike-after-deal-protect-actors-threat-ai). Earlier this month, the actors’ union inked a [deal](https://decrypt.co/226536/actors-record-labors-ink-a-i-deal-limiting-voice-replication) with key players in the music industry that limits the use of AI with actors’ voices by record labels.

“What is not acceptable is when my art and my identity can simply be taken by a third party and exploited falsely for their own gain without my consent due to the absence of appropriate legislative control and restriction,” FKA Twigs added.

[SAG-AFTRA Ends Strike After Deal to Protect Actors From 'Threat of AI'](https://decrypt.co/205299/sag-aftra-ends-strike-after-deal-protect-actors-threat-ai)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The U.S. actors' union SAG-AFTRA has ended its months-long strike after reaching a "tentative deal" with Hollywood studios that includes provisions to protect actors from the "threat of AI." The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) announced the end of the strike in a Twitter thread, announcing that the TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee had voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Produc...

In October, a bipartisan group of Senators introduced the “[No Fakes Act,](https://decrypt.co/201305/senators-want-ban-ai-copycats-like-fake-drake-weeknd-song)” aiming to outlaw the creation of AI-generated likenesses without consent. This legislation responds to concerns about AI's use in mimicking individuals in media, highlighted by an unauthorized AI-generated song featuring Drake and The Weeknd.

While many in the entertainment industry have called out AI creators for stealing their vocals and stylings, some artists have [embraced](https://decrypt.co/resources/famous-pop-stars-and-their-views-on-music-ai-from-grimes-to-drake) the technology, including electronic musician Grimes, who, in 2023, encouraged fans to create an AI-generated version of her voice, with a 50% [royalty](https://decrypt.co/137649/grimes-offers-50-royalties-on-ai-generated-music-using-her-voice).

In November, the Beatles used AI to resurrect John Lennon and George Harrison to join Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in completing their final album, “[Now and Then](https://decrypt.co/204170/beatles-final-song-now-and-then-brought-to-life-by-ai).” In an interview with _Decrypt_ earlier this month, Avenged Sevenfold frontman [Matt Sanders](https://decrypt.co/226059/ai-human-music-fans-wont-care-avenged-sevenfold-frontman) said in 20 years people won't even care whether music was made with AI.

For FKA Twigs, however, the key point is protecting the legacy she spent years creating through her music.

“What it boils down to is my spirit, my art—my brand is my brand,” she said. “I've spent years developing it, and it's mine... it doesn't belong to anybody else for it to be used in a commercial sense or cultural sense, or even just for a laugh.”

“I am me, I am a human being," she continued. "And we have to protect that."

Aptos Price Prediction as Community Welcomes Shinami – Where Might APT Go Next?

Despite an exciting new partnership with innovative gas credit protocol Shinami, the Aptos (APT) price was subdued on Tuesday.

The Aptos price fell 4.5% on the session from highs around $9.30 to the $8.50s.

The price drop comes amid sell pressure across the crypto space, with most major coins dropping a few percent.

The [debut of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong was a dud](https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kongs-new-spot-bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-see-11-2-million-in-trading-volume-on-debut-day.htm), and macro remains a headwind. The [Fed is expected reiterate patience](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/confounding-us-economic-inflation-data-muddy-feds-rate-path-2024-04-25/) when it comes to rate cuts at tomorrow’s meeting.

That helped kill any excitement about the partnership with Shinami.

[![Image 5: a man is holding a coin in front of a red background](https://cimg.co/other/906/337275/99bitcoin-tokens-960x200.png)](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/outgoing/906/1/5)

Shinami is a protocol that allows [dApps](https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm) to purchase gas credits so that dApp users can transact for free.

&gt; We’re now on 2 chains! Excited to partner with [@Aptos](https://twitter.com/Aptos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to support Move builders, starting with a gas credits program 🤝. 🧵 1/2 [pic.twitter.com/00lKaCZtwX](https://t.co/00lKaCZtwX)

And Aptos is giving [dApp](https://cryptonews.com/news/what-dapp-can-we-really-trust-dapps-2022.htm) builders some of these credits for free to encourage development.

That should help spur development on the upcoming chain, which is good for its long-term prospects.

That being said, in the short-term, Aptos traders are focused on chart analysis.

With the Aptos price currently 55% down from last month’s highs, here is where it might go next.

**Aptos Price Prediction – Where Might APT Go Next?**
-----------------------------------------------------


The $7.50 area is a key zone of support for APT. But with the 21DMA adding downside pressure to the price, a downside break could be coming soon.

That could open the door to a return to late-2023 lows in the $4.70 area.

Aptos remains a highly risky altcoin to invest in. Sure, its got a lot of potential.

After all, the blockchain was built by former Facebook developers (who worked on Libra). And, presumably, former Facebook employees are highly competent.

That being said, the blockchain will need to see further adoption to justify its hefty [$3.6 billion market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/).

As per [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos), it last had $640 million in trade value locked (TVL).

That’s a good start. But for Aptos to be worth tens of billions it will need to have a TVL in the billions.

**APT Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice Casino (DICE)**
---------------------------------------------------------


Crypto investors looking for investments with greater upside potential than Aptos should check out presale investing.

Web3 projects and protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to raise funds for development.

If presale investors can find a good project that gains traction in the market, they can book exponential gains.

One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is [Mega Dice Casino](https://cryptonews.com/ext/dice/).

This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token DICE.

DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.

The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.

Crypto billionaire Changpeng “C.Z.” Zhao took to Twitter hours after being [sentenced to four months in prison](https://decrypt.co/228674/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentence-money-laundering?amp=1) in a Seattle courtroom to thank supporters and call out a “silver lining” to the months-long legal process.

“I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life,” Zhao [wrote](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?s=46). “I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase.”

He also praised his former company and reinforced the overall theme of his court case.

“A silver lining of this whole process is that Binance has been under the microscope and funds are SAFU,” he said. “Compliance is super important... Protect users!”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Former Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison Tuesday, punished after pleading guilty to money laundering violations last year. Changpeng Zhao "had the personnel, resources, and wherewithal to comply with U.S. regulations,” U.S. District Judge Richard Jones said in Seattle while delivering Zhao’s sentence. “But failed at that opportunity." Jones also cited a statement from Zhao that said “it was better to ask forgiveness than permission," with the judge that he wa...

Zhao had [pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges](https://decrypt.co/206873/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-step-down-plead-guilty) last year, which focused on a corporate culture at Binance that federal prosecutors say sidelined fraud prevention in favor of growth. He was forced to leave the company and pay a $50 million fine.

The U.S. Department of Justice said Zhao should be subject to enhanced sentencing guidelines due to the severity of his crimes, and [asked the judge for a three-year prison sentence](https://decrypt.co/227779/us-department-of-justice-seeks-3-year-jail-sentence-for-former-binance-ceo-cz). Tuesday's sentencing began with a debate over the appropriate sentence, as prosecutors wanting to use the case to “send a message” to future bad actors.

U.S. District Judge Richard Jones disagreed, and instead followed the recommendations of the federal probation office. Zhao will receive credit for time already served, and the four-year sentence could include as little as 10 months behind bars with the remaining time under supervised release.

“Everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature and a positive nature," Jones told Zhao, according to _The Verge_.

When Zhao has completed his sentence, his “next chapter” in education will likely include Giggle Academy, an online education platform for students from first grade through high school.

On a bearish day in the crypto market that was marred by a weak debut to spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong and data that reinforced expectations that the Fed will wait longer before cutting interest rates, traders looking for quick gains are flocking to on-chain shitcoin markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.

The new crypto ETF launch in Hong Kong attracted only $11 million in first-day trading volumes. Some had been expecting as much as $300 million in first-day trade.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) (BTC) slipped briefly below $60,000 and hit its lowest level since February.

[Ether](https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/) (ETH), meanwhile, was probing sub-$3,000 levels and eyeing a test of earlier monthly lows.

With the rest of the [altcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/) market a sea of red, traders flocked to the on-chain markets, where newly launched tokens are always pumping.

**On-Chain Markets Explained**
------------------------------


On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued and trade directly on the blockchain.

For example, the world’s second-largest meme coin [Shiba Inu](https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/) (SHIB) is an [ERC-20](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-erc20-wallets/) token issued directly onto Ethereum.

Shiba Inu can be traded directly on the Ethereum blockchain using decentralized exchanges ([DEX](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-decentralized-exchanges/)) like Uniswap.

Newly launched [shitcoins](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/) and [meme coins](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/) can also be traded in the exact same way.

Indeed, new coins are always popping up, and these coins frequently post fast exponential gains.

That’s because the shitcoin market is highly illiquid, with a small amount of buy/sell pressure able to produce outsized moves.

The prospect of making quick [10x](https://cryptonews.com/videos/top-5-crypto-to-buy-before-2024-10x-potential-crypto-tokens.htm) or more gains is a key reason why on-chain shitcoin markets attract so many investors.

But traders need to be cautious as most as scams. There is next to no barrier for anyone to issue their own token.

Scammers take advantage of this, issuing worthless coins but tricking investors into buying them nonetheless.

[Scams](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm) can take the form of [rug pulls](https://cryptonews.com/news/rug-pulls-account-for-majority-of-scams-as-q3-2023-exploits-wipe-out-720-million.htm) (where a project is abandoned and liquidity abruptly pulled) or pump-and-dump schemes.

Alternatively, scammers might insert malicious code into a contract to create unfair trading conditions.

Here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring, as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum).

**Top Crypto Gainers Today**
----------------------------

### **Elon (ELON)**

A relatively new Elon Musk-themed meme coin Elon (ELON) is pumping on Tuesday, as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xd6b117076222d95a05032a99f10738103c60d64d).

https://twitter.com/Elon0x69420/status/1785006681350402072

The token has pumped 225% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of $23.2 million. And it last has $1.0 million in locked liquidity.

As per Go+ Security, ELON has two concerning aspects to its smart contract. Investors should note that ELON is probably just another pump-and-dump with no long-term value.

### **America (AMERICA)**

After a strong first day of trade on Monday, meme coin America (AMERICA) has continued its bullish momentum into Tuesday.

The token has reportedly already donated $10,000 to veterans.

&gt; 🚨BREAKING: $AMERICA ([@0x1776America](https://twitter.com/0x1776America?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) on ETH has Officially Donated $10,000 to Veterans in the First 24 Hours of Launch!
&gt; 
&gt; Support this amazing team BELOW! 🇺🇸

&gt; 
&gt; — Donald J. Trump 🇺🇸 News (@DonaldTNews) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/DonaldTNews/status/1785424880441114640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

As per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x66d5871236685ec4470142b6ed86b61fcad0059a), AMERICA was last up 200% in 24 hours and trading with a market cap of $1.4 million.

The token has $130,000 in locked liquidity, reducing rug pull risk. It also has a great ratio of rocket emoji’s to red flag or shitcoin emoji’s on DEXScreener.

That suggests it is popular in the community. Still, like ELON, it’s probably just another pump-and-dump meme coin.

Traders shouldn’t invest more than they can afford to lose.

### **Monke (MONKE)**

A meme coin called Monke (MONKE) is up 75% in the past 24 hours, as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x615d7eb337e6912acf59331f051525a14fa79a82).

https://twitter.com/MonkecoinERC/status/1784512469479870974

The coin launched four days ago, but has struggled to break out of a $0.0006-$0.002 range.

Its market cap was last $1.4 million, with $250,000 in locked liquidity.

The meme coin has 230 rocket emojis, but 103 red flag emojis on DEXScreener. It only has two concerning aspects to its smart contract.

But like most newly issued coins, it’s probably just another pump-and-dump.

**Better Alternative to Shitcoins**
-----------------------------------


As noted numerous times already, [shitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/) markets are highly risky.

Investors looking to take on substantial risk for big upside potential should instead consider [presale](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-a-crypto-presale/) investing or [ICOs](https://cryptonews.com/news/ico-news/).

[Web3](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/) projects/protocols often raise funds via an early bird sale of their native tokens to power development.

Of course, presale investing isn’t without risks. Projects can fail to deliver on their vision for all manner of reasons.

But if investors are able to reliably identify good projects, presale investing can be hugely profitable.

Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing through the market. Here are their best picks for 2024.

Whitelisted Crypto Wallets Make 3,000,000% Gains on Base Altcoin

Two cryptocurrency wallets saw astronomical returns exceeding 30,830 times their initial investment on a memecoin launched on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution [Base](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2023/02/what-is-base-coinbases-new-layer-2-network/).

According to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, two cryptocurrency allets whitelisted by the deployer of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Brett ($BRETT) spent 0.034 ETH worth little over $100 to buy 172.56 million tokens back in February.

These wallets, according to the on-chain analysis service, then sold 122.74 million BRETT tokens for a whopping 890.65 ETH, worth $3.14 million via multiple wallets to get a return of over 3,000,000%.

Whitelisted wallets, it’s worth noting, are wallets that are [approved](https://www.coinbase.com/pt-pt/learn/tips-and-tutorials/what-is-a-crypto-whitelist) to participate in specific cryptocurrency events such as initial coin offerings, and in this case a social media user [noted](https://twitter.com/shady_oak1/status/1783623226557640708) that a total of 139 addresses were whitelisted, and 108 bought tokens during the whitelist period.

The pseudonymous user has later on noted they believe they “know who owns literally very whitelisted wallet” for the cryptocurrency and are expected to reveal the data “within a few days.”

Per their analysis, BRETT’s insiders were holding as much as 91% of the cryptocurrency’s supply before other investors could even buy into the cryptocurrency, and suggested one influencer made “nearly 1600 ETH \[$4.8 million\] for tokens they got for marketing that were bought during the whitelist phase.” &gt; A thread about how [$BRETT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRETT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) was not actually a fair launch and insiders were holding over 81% of the supply before most people could buy.

Brett, self-proclaimed as the “mascot” of the Base chain, is currently trading at $0.0357, reflecting a decline of more than 11% in the last 24 hours. Its price drop comes after a months-long memecoin trading frenzy on both the Solana and Base networks, with several traders making and losing fortunes off of newly launched digital assets.

In one case, a memecoin saw a dramatic price rise of over 3000% over a 24-hour period, and a cryptocurrency trader managed to take advantage by betting 50 SOL, worth around $9,000, in the cryptocurrency. Its rise has [seen them make a profit of over $123,000.](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/03/memecoin-mania-crypto-trader-turns-50-sol-into-123000-after-newly-launched-token-soars-3000/) Another trader, however, [lost $138,000 in minutes](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/03/crypto-trader-loses-138000-in-35-minutes-trading-little-known-solana-based-altcoin/) trading a little-known token.

In another case, a cryptocurrency trader managed to make a profit of over $3 million trading a newly launched Solana-based memecoin within just 12 minutes after betting nearly $2 million on it right after it started trading.

In yet another incident, a trader, identified on-chain by the alias “sundayfunday.sol,”turn a [$72,000 investment into a staggering $30 million](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/03/solana-sol-trader-turns-72000-into-30-million-in-three-days/) within just three days trading a little-known cryptocurrency.

Various users on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), have suggested that the traders making such high-risk investments in these newly launched cryptocurrencies are the developers behind them or marketers helping pump the cryptocurrency’s price up so they could later sell the tokens at a higher value.

![Image 1: Binance, Polygon lead in this area, but struggle in others - why?](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/News_Articles_FI_-_Adewale_2-1-1200x686.webp)

*   _Binance and Polygon saw more unique addresses than other chains._
*   _TVL and volume reduced despite the number of unique addresses._

Recent data indicates that [Binance \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) and [Polygon \[MATIC\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/polygon-news/) have had the most active addresses. Still, it’s essential to analyze how this has influenced their volumes and Total Value Locked (TVL).

Additionally, how have BNB and MATIC trended with their networks’ volume of unique addresses?

#### **Binance and Polygon lead rankings**

In a recent ranking of top blockchains by unique addresses conducted by [Crypto Rank](https://twitter.com/CryptoRank_io/status/1784972053956669621?t=_yV0G5iD54nOAQB8A8xL_g&amp;s=19), the [Binance](https://ambcrypto.com/binance-chain-sees-revenue-jump-70-will-it-push-bnb-higher/) Smart Chain and Polygon claimed the top two positions.

According to data from the ranking platform, the Binance Smart Chain had over 444 million unique addresses, while [Polygon](https://ambcrypto.com/polygon-heres-how-matic-reacted-to-franklin-templetons-latest-move/) had over 419 million.

These figures are noteworthy, as the combined total of unique addresses on these platforms surpassed the total volume of unique addresses on the next three platforms.

Furthermore, they outpaced major platforms like [Ethereum \[ETH\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/) regarding unique addresses, indicating significant user adoption and activity.

#### **Any impact on volume and TVL?**

Analysis of the volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) on the [Binance](https://ambcrypto.com/bnb-chain-tvl-rises-with-new-addition-but-is-it-still-early-days/) Smart Chain (BSC) using DefiLlama data revealed a lack of significant recent movements.

The network experienced notable activity around March, marked by consecutive spikes in volume, peaking at over $2.5 billion. However, as of the latest data, the volume has decreased to approximately $614 million.

Similarly, the TVL saw a brief spike, reaching over $6.7 billion in the past week, but has since declined to around $5.4 billion.

[![Image 2: Polygon TVL and volume](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20874%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BNB-volume-and-TVL.png)

Source: DefiLlama

Similarly, AMBCrypto’s examination of the volume and TVL on [Polygon](https://ambcrypto.com/polygons-1-million-milestone-leaves-matic-whales-with-this-decision/) indicated a lack of recent notable trends.

At the time of analysis, the volume was approximately $69 million, with a recent decline observed. The TVL also stood at around $917 million, showing a recent decline.

[![Image 3: Polygon TVL and volume](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20874%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Polygon-volume-and-TVL.png)

Source: DefiLlama

These metrics suggest that despite the surge in unique addresses, there has yet to be a corresponding increase in activity or engagement on these networks.

#### **BNB and MATIC see a negative start to the week**

AMBCrypto’s analysis of [BNB](https://ambcrypto.com/bnb-rises-against-bitcoin-what-does-this-mean-for-the-crypto-market/) indicated a departure from its positive start to the week, as the coin experienced a decline in trading.

On the 29th of April, BNB concluded trading with a 1.23% decrease, trading at approximately $592.7. As of this writing, there was a further 1.72% decrease, resulting in a trading price of around $582.9.

Similarly, [MATIC](https://ambcrypto.com/will-polygon-matic-beat-its-26-drop-climb-back-towards-1/) exhibited a more negative trend, with a downward trajectory observed since the beginning of the week.

At the time of analysis, MATIC was trading at approximately $0.67, reflecting a decline of over 4%.

*   [Shiba Inu's volatility drops](#h212)
*   [Bitcoin's potential fuel](#h321)

[Ethereum](https://u.today/trons-justin-sun-breaks-silence-on-latest-ethereum-bets) has entered an ascending price channel, which could dictate its performance in the short term. This technical formation suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook but also flags potential risks ahead.

The ascending channel observed on Ethereum’s daily price chart shows that [ETH](https://u.today/sec-boss-has-long-viewed-ethereum-as-a-security-new-filing-reveals) has been achieving higher lows and higher highs, a bullish indicator in traditional market analysis. However, the current positioning near the lower boundary of the channel around $3,000 raises concerns about a possible breakdown acceleration. If Ethereum fails to hold this level, it could see a correction toward the $2,700 mark, which would signify a significant shift in market sentiment and momentum.

![Image 2: ETHUSD Chart](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/image_738.png)

[ETH/USD Chart by TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)

This potential decline to $2,700 is critical as it aligns with the 200 EMA and could serve as a foundation for ETH to stabilize and potentially rebound. However, should [ETH](https://u.today/ethereum-eth-whale-triggers-38-million-sell-off-details) maintain its trajectory within the ascending channel, the immediate resistance to watch is at approximately $3,300. Overcoming this level could pave the way for Ethereum to approach the upper boundary of the channel near $3,500, which would reinforce bullish sentiment and possibly attract further buying pressure.

Whether Ethereum will climb to test new resistances or face a downward correction will largely depend on the recovery of Bitcoin and consistent market inflows which are nonexistent at this point in time.

Shiba Inu's volatility drops
----------------------------

[Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-triggers-268-surge-in-whale-activity-as-price-jumps) shows subdued volatility, which might be preparing the ground for an unexpected rally. Despite a prevailing lack of strong price movements, which typically discourages retail investors seeking quick gains, SHIB's recent trading patterns suggest a potential shift in dynamics.

The meme coin, known for its vibrant community and explosive growth phases, is currently witnessing a consolidation phase that could be a precursor to significant price action. Although recent trading volume has not shown dramatic spikes, a gradual increase in buying activity suggests that investors are accumulating positions, likely in anticipation of future price growth.

Currently SHIB is hovering near a critical support level at approximately $0.00002272. If this level holds, it sets a strong base for the token. However, a breakdown below this support could see SHIB testing further lows around $0.000017.

On the upside, if [SHIB](https://u.today/shytoshi-kusamas-important-message-shared-with-shib-community-details) can gain enough momentum to push through current market sluggishness, the first significant resistance lies near $0.00002690. Overcoming this barrier could validate bullish sentiment, leading to a test of the next resistance at around $0.00002960. Such movements would not only confirm a reversal but could also reignite interest among retail investors who thrive on volatility and dynamic price movements.

The current market situation for SHIB, characterized by its relative stability and increasing purchase volume in quantity, may indeed set the stage for a surprising turn.  

Bitcoin's potential fuel
------------------------

[Bitcoin](https://u.today/poloniex-hacker-moves-enormous-32-million-in-bitcoin) and Ethereum spot ETFs have started trading in Hong Kong. It opens new avenues for both local and nonlocal investors who meet the strict regulatory requirements, including comprehensive customer due diligence. The introduction of these ETFs is seen as a significant step forward in the mainstream financial adoption of cryptocurrencies and could potentially serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's price movement.

Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a sideways trend in the market, accompanied by descending trading volumes, signaling a period of consolidation. Despite this, the launch of ETFs introduces fresh liquidity and could attract institutional investors, potentially invigorating Bitcoin’s market activity.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range, with immediate resistance near the $63,000 mark. This level has acted as a strong resistance point over recent weeks. On the downside, the support at around $59,988 has been crucial in preventing further declines.  

If Bitcoin can surpass this threshold, the next significant resistance lies near $65,000. A sustained move above this level might confirm a revitalization of the bullish trend, possibly steering Bitcoin toward higher price points in the near future.

**Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price is declining on the daily chart, but this is part of a much bigger bullish picture.**

Jumping in at the right time could prove to be beneficial, but there are certain levels that investors must be wary of.

Is It the Right Time to Buy Dogecoin?
-------------------------------------

Dogecoin’s price is expected to show a bullish run in the coming days owing to the value of the meme coin in the market. Based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, the altcoin is currently undervalued. 

The MVRV ratio measures investor’s profit and loss. Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV at -15% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation.

Historically, DOGE recovery occurs at around -9% to -21%, labeled an opportunity zone. Therefore, the [DOGE accumulated by investors](https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-lists-3-altcoins-futures/) at the current price will likely bear profits once recovery initiates.

Furthermore, investors also show conviction toward a rally. This is derived from the movement of supply within different categories of [HODLers](https://beincrypto.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-on-the-best-hardware-wallets-in-2024/).

In the last two weeks, the supply held by long-term holders has seen a 9% increase from 38%. At 47%, they are now the largest holders of DOGE supply. These investors are known to hold their assets for more than a year, ascertaining confidence and conviction in the meme coin is high.

This could drive the rally further ahead and sustain the increase.

DOGE Price Prediction: Breakout Falling Wedge
---------------------------------------------

Trading at $0.137 at the time of writing, [Dogecoin is moving within a descending wedge](https://beincrypto.com/doge-price-holders-eye-profits/). This bullish chart pattern is characterized by converging trendlines with lower highs and lower lows, indicating a potential trend reversal when the price breaks out of the wedge formation to the upside.

Thus, [DOGE breaking out](https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-doge-massive-price-surge/) would likely push the price to $0.168 propelled by the market conditions. Breaching this resistance would mark a 24% rally for the meme coin.

However, at the time of writing, the chances of a death cross are also rising, which could extend the ongoing decline. As a result, Dogecoin’s price could fall through the descending wedge to test $0.127 as support, which would invalidate the bullish thesis.

[Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-in-may/) saw a significant spike in a major metric, which signals a bullish outlook for the second-largest meme coin by market cap. Despite this, Shiba Inu’s price has failed to react positively, which can undoubtedly be a concern for [token holders](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-top-5-private-holders/). 

Shibarium Sees Increase In Active Accounts 
-------------------------------------------

[Data](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats) from Shibariumscan shows that the number of active accounts on the [layer-2 network](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-hard-fork/) rose from 1290 on April 27 to 3,839 on April 28, representing over a 144% increase. Such development is bullish for Shiba Inu, considering how the layer-2 network has been [integral](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/) to the meme coin’s success since it [launched last year](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/). 

[![Image 2: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714545640321138&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fshiba-inu-144-spike-metric%2F&amp;hc=64211fb96c613dceae027fd9bc3ee700fccbd0f7&amp;location=)

Shibarium also saw the number of new transactions on the network spike from 4,997 on April 27 to 12,191 on April 28. This is even more bullish for Shiba Inu since the amount of SHIB burns Shibarium carries out depends on the number of transactions it records. Meanwhile, these aren’t the only recent bullish developments for Shiba Inu. 

NewsBTC [recently reported](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibaswap-expands-to-shibarium/) that SHIB’s foremost decentralized exchange (DEX), ShibaSwap, is [expanding](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/) to Shibarium. This move is expected to increase ShibaSwap’s user base and Shibarium’s, by extension. Shiba Inu will ultimately benefit since an increase in Shibarium’s user base means more transactions, leading to more [SHIB burns](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-48554/). 

[![Image 3: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714545640321207&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fshiba-inu-144-spike-metric%2F&amp;hc=c5cf5b95c22273838fc39b64d075fc1ed335e6d0&amp;location=)

Seeing how these metrics paint a bullish outlook for the meme coin, it isn’t out of place to wonder why Shiba Inu has experienced [significant price drops](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/) lately. One reason for this price decline is Bitcoin’s price action. [Data](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=all&amp;chart=all) from the market intelligence platform [IntoTheBlock](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-time-bull-market-intotheblock-explains-why/) shows that SHIB’s price correlation with Bitcoin is currently at 0.82%, which suggests a “strong positive correlation” between both tokens.

Therefore, SHIB’s price has mirrored [Bitcoin’s](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-300000-crypto-pundit/), which has recorded significant price declines lately. Another reason for Shiba Inu’s price decline is the drop in large transactions, with data from IntoTheBlock showing a 4.60% drop in this crucial metric. 

This suggests that [Shiba Inu whales](https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20Whale%20Accumulates%20332%20Billion%20SHIB%20Tokens&amp;text=A%20plausible%20explanation%20is%20the,almost%2040%20trillion%20SHIB%20tokens.) are cooling off on their investment in the meme coin, as this recent market downtrend may be affecting their confidence. These whales play a massive role in SHIB’s price discovery, and the meme coin’s price could pick up once they recover their confidence in the market. 

A drop in Shiba Inu’s burn rate has also contributed to its recent decline. [Data](https://x.com/shibburn/status/1785172274326184396) from the [burn tracking website Shibburn](https://www.shibburn.com/) shows a 76% decline in the number of SHIB tokens burnt in the past seven days and a 79% decline in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) miners show no signs of “capitulation” despite their revenue falling to 14-month lows following the halving event in April. 

In an April 30 [post](https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1785171733454143633?s=46&amp;t=MuRujqZUAz3TQE1vmr3c6A) to X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that following a drop in revenue to levels post having, Bitcoin miners now face two options, capitulation or await growth in the price of Bitcoin to cover their costs.

&gt; “Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in BTC price.”

Citing the 365-day Puell Multiple chart — a metric that estimates the level of sell pressure from miners — Ju said miners show no signs of capitulation “for now.”

Ju’s analysis comes as a recent crypto price dip has sparked concerns about miner capitulation.

Bitcoin miner revenue soared immediately following the halving with rare satoshi hunters and Runes Protocol degens [paying through the nose](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miners-reap-bitcoin-runes-fees) for space on the first blocks mined after the halving on April 20.

However, the appetite for these novel Bitcoin-based assets has declined in recent weeks — weighed down by a wider lull in price action across the crypto market.

“Miners had a brief reprieve following the halving as bitcoin’s price rose, but their profits are now being seriously crunched post-halving now that the spot BTC price is moving against them,” [said](https://twitter.com/TheBitcoinLayer/status/1785472860632621237) market research provider The Bitcoin Layer in an April 30 post on X. 

“Miner capitulation risk is on the rise, with profits as squeezed as they are. If bitcoin’s price continues correcting downward over the next few days and it stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of bitcoin on order to hedge themselves," the firm added.

Notably, Bitcoin’s hashprice — the expected value of 1 Terahashes of hashing power per day — has fallen to an all-time low of $46.55, down 74% from its post-halving peak, per Hashrate index [data](https://twitter.com/hashrateindex/status/1785423021760549018?s=46&amp;t=MuRujqZUAz3TQE1vmr3c6A).

The price of Bitcoin is currently sitting at $60,400, down 18% from its March 14 all-time high of $73,700 per TradingView data.

Similarly, the second largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is also down 26% from its yearly high of $4,070 on March 12.

Markdown Content:
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has opposed a motion seeking to dismiss conspiracy and money laundering charges against Roman Semenov, co-founder of Tornado Cash.

The DOJ contended that the defense’s motion introduced disputed facts best left for jury consideration, arguing it was premature for early-stage motions.

In response, DOJ prosecutors scrutinized the alleged crimes attributed to Semenov.

They contested the defense’s portrayal of Tornado Cash, highlighting its inception in 2019 as a crypto mixer service, comprising a website, user interface, smart contracts, and a network of “relayers.”

Accusing Roman Storm and co-developer [Roman Semenov](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1702) of conspiring to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions, U.S. authorities alleged that Tornado Cash facilitated funds laundering for entities like North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

While Storm pleaded not guilty to all charges in September 2023 and was released on a $2 million bond, Semenov clarified his role, stating he contributed to code design but disclaimed accountability for its usage.

Semenov’s legal team emphasized in their motion to dismiss that Tornado Cash doesn’t function as a custodial mixing service and doesn’t meet the criteria of a “financial institution.”

They argued Storm lacked control over the service to prevent its misuse by entities like Lazarus Group.

Prosecutors led by Damian Williams countered, holding Semenov accountable for operating the cryptocurrency mixer and accused him of enabling criminal anonymity.

They criticized Tornado Cash’s co-founders for failing to implement sufficient changes to exclude sanctioned addresses.

These developments coincide with the U.S. government’s heightened scrutiny of crypto-mixing services.

Recently, on April 24, the CEO and CTO of Samourai Wallet, another cryptocurrency mixer, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 and five years, respectively.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, noted that crypto mixing services aren’t inherently criminal, responding to the arrests of Samourai Wallet’s founders.

URL Source: https://ambcrypto.com/why-worldcoin-will-reach-7-soon-despite-price-drop/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T03:00:57+00:00

Markdown Content:
![Image 1: Why Worldcoin will reach $7 soon despite price drop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _Holders are coping with unrealized losses, indicating a possible buying opportunity._
*   _Circulation decreased, suggesting validation of the bounce to $.7.46._

[Worldcoin’s \[WLD\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/worldcoin-wld-price-prediction) price might have decreased by 45.17% in the last 30 days, but signals on-chain showed that the decline could be a blessing in disguise.

For starters, AMBCrypto evaluated the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. According to data obtained from Santiment, WLD’s 30-day MVRV ratio was -24.86%.

This data implied that most holders of the token were sitting on an unrealized loss. Therefore, if they all decide to sell, the average holder would have to deal with a lower investment value.

But that is unlikely to happen. For the price, the [metric’s position](https://app.santiment.net/charts/F14AhcIp__sCl) could be a good buying opportunity before Worldcoin begins to bounce.

[![Image 2: Increaing development and declining circulation on Worldcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%20867'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/worldcoin-buying-opportunity.png)

Source: Santiment

#### Returns are about to be better

This inference did not come out of the blue, and history showed that a double-digit decline in the MVRV ratio has almost always been a good level for recovery.

For instance, when the metric was at -22.25% in January, the price rallied from $2.50 to $11.88 a few weeks later. However, this does not imply that Worldcoin would produce a similar return in the short term.

However, there is a high chance that the WLD might hit $7.42 as this would leave the average return at $24.57%. Irrespective of the bullish signal, participants have to be on the lookout.

One reason for this was Worldcoin’s [decision](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/circulating-supply-update-sales-trading-firms) to inflate its circulating supply. According to the project, the increase was to meet the demand for its orb-verified World IDs.

However, the statement mentioned that the team would only release 0.1% to 0.4% of the extra supply weekly. If demand for the token increases as supply jumps, then WLD might be able to validate the prediction to $7.

On the other hand, a bearish market condition without [maximum bids](https://ambcrypto.com/worldcoin-bulls-spring-into-action-but-is-it-too-late-for-wld/) for the token might stall the price rise. Meanwhile, the one-day circulation dropped to 1.87 million, according to Santiment.

This decline implied that fewer WLDs have been engaged in transactions. As such, selling pressure might be minimal. Furthermore, development activity was [starting to pick up](https://app.santiment.net/charts/bbG0fviK__sCl) again on the Worldcoin network.

#### Targets begin at the upper resistance

The uptrend suggested that the project might be shipping out a new feature soon. Should this swing continue, it could be a bullish validation that could impact the token’s price.

Besides the on-chain viewpoint, it is also important to check the potential from the technical perspective. On the daily chart, WLD formed a descending channel that lasted from the 9th of March till the time of writing.

However, it seemed that the bulls had found support at $4.43, and were committed to defending the area.

Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was close to being oversold, indicating that a bounce could be close.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a similar signal. Should this prediction play out, the next target for Worldcoin could be a rise to $7.46.

Stablecoin Legislation Could Eclipse Bitcoin ETF Impact - Bitwise CIO

The US Congress could catalyze a more significant shift than introducing [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://bitcoinist.com/expert-flags-dangers-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs/). Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan’s view [underscores](https://experts.bitwiseinvestments.com/cio-memos/stablecoins-bigger-than-bitcoin-etfs) a pivotal moment for the crypto industry.

Hougan suggests that 2024 could see “groundbreaking” legal frameworks that pave the way for mainstream stablecoin adoption, which might profoundly impact the crypto ecosystem.

A Legislative Leap Forward
--------------------------

Recent [remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vLftqnwppc) by Maxine Waters, Ranking Democrat of the House Financial Services Committee, highlighted progress towards stablecoin regulation.

Waters’ announcement that she and Committee Chair Patrick McHenry are close to finalizing a [stablecoin bill](https://bitcoinist.com/coin-center-opposes-unconsititutional-stablecoin/) indicates bipartisan momentum, which could soon materialize into law.

Matt Hougan emphasized the underappreciated significance of this development in his recent communication to Bitwise clients. He believes comprehensive legislation could anchor stablecoins in the mainstream financial system, potentially enhancing their role in global economics.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714545941197690&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fcrypto-stablecoin-legislation-eclip-bitcoin-bitwise%2F&amp;hc=d3fb097ccff2cb67edba87c8d3d77712c8b6f40f&amp;location=)

Hougan identifies multiple drivers behind the bipartisan push for stablecoin legislation. One significant factor is the potential for stablecoins to “bolster” the US dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency.

Moreover, stablecoins are major purchasers of US Treasuries, placing them among the top sovereign holders globally.

The economic incentives are equally compelling, according to Hougan. For instance, [Tether’s profitability](https://bitcoinist.com/tether-splits-into-four-divisions/) with minimal staff compared to traditional banking giants like [Goldman Sachs](https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/) illustrates the operational efficiency and financial potential of stablecoins. Such dynamics are enticing Wall Street to advocate for entry into the stablecoin arena.

The Bitwise CIO noted:

&gt; You can bet your bottom stablecoin: Wall Street is lobbying to be let into the stablecoin game.

The Bigger Picture For Crypto Investors
---------------------------------------

The passage of stablecoin legislation could redefine the landscape of financial transactions. Institutions like JPMorgan might transition from crypto skeptics to proponents, integrating blockchain technologies into their operations.

Hougan predicts that adopting crypto wallets, combined with the efficiency of blockchain-based payment systems, could soon become standard, driven by innovations such as Stripe’s “[pay with stablecoins](https://x.com/collision/status/1783559623511011535)” feature and Visa’s analytics on [rising stablecoin usage](https://visaonchainanalytics.com/).

While stablecoins do not offer appreciation potential, investors can find opportunities in the infrastructure supporting them.

Hougan points to Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, which host substantial stablecoin volumes and many decentralized applications (DeFi).

As the legislative environment becomes more favorable, these technologies are poised for significant growth, reflecting a broader acceptance and integration of crypto into mainstream finance. Hougan concluded:

&gt; In other words: Crypto is poised to take another huge leap into the mainstream.

Meanwhile, the stablecoin market remains strong, with a capitalization of approximately $166 billion, according to [DeFIllama](https://defillama.com/hacks). In contrast, the inflows and outflows in the spot Bitcoin ETF market have been [less substantial](https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows/), highlighting a shift in investor focus as of now.

&gt; Yesterday’s ETF flows by [@FarsideUK](https://twitter.com/FarsideUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) were negative once again, with $83.6 million of outflows.[$GBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) had $82.4 million of outflows.

_Bitcoin price took a hit and even spiked below $60,000. BTC could gain bearish momentum if there is a daily close below the $60,000 support zone._

*   Bitcoin started another decline and traded below the $61,200 zone.
*   The price is trading below $62,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.
*   There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $60,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).
*   The pair could accelerate lower if it fails to recover above $60,400 and then $62,000 this week.

Bitcoin price started another decline below the [$62,500 support level](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-bounces-back-64500/). BTC dropped below the $61,200 level as the bears took control. They even managed to push the price below $60,000.

A low was formed at $59,110 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $60,000 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $64,738 swing high to the $59,110 low.

There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $60,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

The first major resistance could be $61,200. The next key resistance could be $62,000 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $64,738 swing high to the $59,110 low.

A clear move above the $62,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next resistance now sits at $62,500. If there is a clear move above the $62,500 resistance zone, the price could continue to move up. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $64,000.

More Downsides In BTC?
----------------------

If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $60,400 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $59,500 level.

The first major support is $59,100. If there is a close below $59,100, the price could start to drop toward $58,000. Any more losses might send the price toward the $56,400 support zone in the near term.

Technical indicators:

Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

Major Support Levels – $59,500, followed by $59,100.

Major Resistance Levels – $60,400, $61,200, and $62,000.

Published Time: 2024-04-30T22:14:51.000-04:00

Markdown Content:
**Martin Shkreli**, the infamous former pharmaceutical executive, recently made an intriguing comment on social media platform X, hinting at his prison life. This comes as **Changpeng Zhao**, the co-founder of **Binance** BNB/USD, has been sentenced to prison.

**What Happened**: Shkreli, who is known as the “**Pharma Bro**,” took to social media platform X to comment on a post by billionaire Binance Co-Founder Changpeng Zhao. Shkreli wrote, “burgers on wednesday, chicken on Thursday,” hinting at the prison menu.

Shkreli has been known for sharing [advice on prison life](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/03/37764805/sam-bankman-fried-considered-coming-out-as-a-republican-on-tucker-carlsons-show-after-ftxs). In November, he boasted to **Tucker Carlson** that **Sam Bankman-Fried** had sought his advice on serving time in prison, as the FTX founder faced a potential sentence of over 100 years.

Shkreli was released from federal prison in May 2022 after serving approximately five years. Following a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission, he was ordered to repay $64 million and faced a lifetime ban, which he contested as excessive and limiting his freedom of speech.

According to Martin Shkreli’s verified account on X, he [announced](https://x.com/wagieeacc/status/1778826437576790225) that he would be moving his account to ‘@martinshkreli,’ expressing apologies for any messages sent from the previous account due to it being set as default on his iPhone and acknowledging his laziness.

On the other hand, Zhao, the co-founder and former CEO of Binance, has been [sentenced to four months in prison](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38532677/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison) for his involvement in the failure to establish an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at the cryptocurrency exchange. Despite his personal situation, Zhao emphasized the importance of compliance in the crypto industry.

**Why It Matters**: Zhao’s legal troubles have been a point of concern in the cryptocurrency industry. Just a week before his sentencing, Zhao [surrendered his voting power in Binance](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38315241/binance-secures-major-win-with-dubai-crypto-license-after-changpeng-zhao-surrenders-voting), which led to the exchange securing a crucial regulatory license in Dubai. This move was seen as a significant step towards Binance’s compliance with global regulations.

Earlier in April, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had [pushed for a three-year prison term](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38401035/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-apologizes-doj-pushes-for-3-year-sentence) for Zhao, citing serious lapses in regulatory compliance during his tenure at Binance. Despite the legal challenges, Binance has continued to operate, and Zhao’s recent tweet indicates his commitment to the industry’s compliance and development.

**Price Action**: As of the latest update, BNB is trading at $573.32, marking a decrease of 4.76% over the past 24 hours and a 5.42% decline over the last week. Meanwhile, **Bitcoin** BTC/USD is currently priced at $60,215.92, reflecting a 6.73% drop in the last 24 hours, according to the data [from Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard).

Markdown Content:
Ethereum (ETH) has faced some regulatory turmoil amid rumors of a [rejection](https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-on-hold-us-regulators-expected-to-block-spot-products-in-may/) of ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in May. The second largest cryptocurrency has also been in the spotlight after a key component in its ecosystem, Consensys, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for “unlawful seizure of authority” over the asset.

The lawsuit sparked different conversations, including the SEC’s regulatory inconsistencies and speculation about the relationship between the US agency and people close to Ethereum.

[![Image 1: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714546017944331&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Funrealistic-demands-crypto-figure-says-consensys-might-need-prayers%2F&amp;hc=2d26547b4febae71780e16d4eeffa5fd9c0168bc&amp;location=)

On April 25, blockchain software company Consensys filed a [lawsuit](https://bitcoinist.com/consensys-sues-sec-over-ethereum-regulation/) against the US SEC. The lawsuit seeks a court ruling that declares ETH is not a security.

The news opened a broad discussion among crypto community members about the implications of the demand. Moreover, it reignited the ETH Gate discussion, which saw Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz and Cardano’s Founder Charles Hoskinson in a heated back-and-forth [on X](https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1784688215842251240).

A crypto figure has deemed Consensys’ demands as unrealistic amid the discussions. Pseudonym crypto sleuth Dr. Huber [shared](https://x.com/Leerzeit/status/1785204074658353464) the “Prayer for Relief” section of the lawsuit, asserting that the software company “really needs some prayers.”

[![Image 2: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368621&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287403&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714546017946238&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Funrealistic-demands-crypto-figure-says-consensys-might-need-prayers%2F&amp;hc=6a42aff24e65131a2399b7e9d1cc2ed71902e1e5&amp;location=)

Besides classifying Ethereum as a non-security, Consensys is praying for the court to declare that any investigation or enforcement on the company over ETH transactions being classified as security would exceed the SEC’s authority.

Similarly, the firm demands that any action against the company based on its operating as a “broker” under the Exchange Act through its MetaMask wallet would be outside the SEC’s Authority.

Additionally, Consensys is asking for a “permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the SEC and its officers and agents from pursuing any investigation or enforcement action” related to the Swap of Staking features of its MetaMask software.

According to the crypto figure, the chance of a court giving a company and its subsidiaries “a general and permanent lifetime free pass against SEC Securities investigations” is minimal.

The crypto sleuth [considers](https://x.com/Leerzeit/status/1785204889141882972) that approval of Consensys’ requests would mean that “no ETH transaction could ever be considered a securities offering,” which reduces the probability of a ruling in favor of the company.

Unclear Regulatory Framework For Cryptocurrencies
-------------------------------------------------

Ethereum’s classification by the regulator is among the topics where clarity has been [missing](https://bitcoinist.com/secs-gary-gensler-crumbles-when-asked-if-ethereum-is-a-security/). Under the previous SEC Chair Jay Clayton, the second-largest cryptocurrency was not considered a security.

Moreover, in his 2018 speech, former Director of the Division of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman classified Ethereum and Bitcoin as non-securities.

However, recent [reports](https://bitcoinist.com/sec-chair-genslers-stance-on-ethereum/) allege that the regulator has considered ETH an “unregistered security” for over a year. The SEC has been seemingly investigating the cryptocurrency status with “unusual secrecy” since March 2023.

The definite classification of digital assets as security could have significant implications for the crypto industry. The Consensys lawsuit has highlighted the SEC’s unclear regulatory framework.

The agency’s inconsistency was pointed out by the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry. In a Tuesday statement, Chair McHenry affirmed that SEC’s current Chairman Gary Gensler “knowingly misled Congress.”

&gt; [#ICYMI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICYMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): New court filings indicate that [@SECGov](https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of [#ETH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) at a [@FinancialCmte](https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) hearing to conduct oversight of his agency.

&gt; 📖 Read my full statement 👇 [pic.twitter.com/8osMpbY6Iu](https://t.co/8osMpbY6Iu)

Per the statement, Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC’s classification of ETH, which shows an “intentional attempt to misrepresent the Commission’s position.”

An adverse ruling would contradict the SEC’s previous guidance and extend the agency’s regulatory grip. Similarly, it would also dispute the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classification of the asset as a commodity.

Ultimately, it would show “yet another example of the arbitrary and capricious nature of the agency’s regulation by enforcement approach to digital assets.”

**[Doge With Hat (DOGEHAT)](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9dhk1fjchrpmxtuheffxg8ytvgssozvyc5pp3casyeml) could become a viral memecoin, like Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE).**

Doge With Hat (DOGEHAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).

Macro Taking 'Wind' Out of Crypto: Starkiller's Drogen

Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Doge With Hat presents a similar opportunity.

[Doge With Hat](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9dhk1fjchrpmxtuheffxg8ytvgssozvyc5pp3casyeml) has market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.

The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Doge With Hat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.

Currently, Doge With Hat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-USDC) and [Raydium](https://beta.raydium.io/swap/), and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.

To buy Doge With Hat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge With Hat by entering its contract address – **2Tw3MJ2wCZZte6GvfaqVch3WQnwfdJByST7ih7e62yjb** – in the receiving field.

In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like [DOGEHAT](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9dhk1fjchrpmxtuheffxg8ytvgssozvyc5pp3casyeml).

Real-world asset tokenization protocols have seen explosive growth over the last year with the total value locked (TVL) across the sector surging to a new all-time high.

In a May 1 post to X, blockchain analytics and research firm Messari [wrote](https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1785448731803807800) that TVL for real-world asset ([RWA](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/tokenized-real-world-assets-rwa-in-defi)) protocols had spiked to almost $8 billion as of April 26.

The analytics firm shared that RWA protocols had witnessed “a remarkable resurgence,” over the past year, adding that the sector’s growth had been driven by a “market preference for debt-based, high-yield investments.”

The $8 billion TVL figure excludes fiat-backed stablecoins such as Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)) and USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)) and includes carry trade protocols, underwriting, yield-bearing stablecoins, commodities, securities, and real estate tokenization protocols.

Since February, the TVL in RWA protocols has surged by almost 60%.

Decentralized finance analytics platform DeFiLlama provided a slightly lower figure of $6 billion in combined TVL for RWA protocols. It also [shows](https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA) a monumental growth of around 700% in protocol TVL since the beginning of 2023.

Notably, the total value locked is not the only metric that has experienced impressive growth this year.

The number of active users on RWA protocols has also surged since February — denoting an increase in the sector's popularity among smaller retail users, [per](https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/rwa) Dune Analytics data.

Protocols such as digital carbon market platforms Toucan and KlimaDAO, and real estate tokenization protocol Propy have seen the lion’s share of that growth in terms of active users.

Tokenized Treasuries have also seen huge growth as yields remain high in an environment of high inflation and interest rates in the United States.

There is currently a record $1.29 billion locked in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, [according](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries) to RWA.xyz. This figure has surged by 80% since the beginning of 2024, primarily driven by protocols such as Securitize and Ondo.

The recent performance of BlackRock’s Ethereum-based Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) — which has [just become](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrocks-buidl-becomes-worlds-largest-tokenized-treasury-fund) the world’s largest tokenized treasury fund — and the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) have contributed heavily to the growth of this corner of the RWA market.

Layer-1 blockchain Fantom is pushing the idea of “safer memecoins” by setting aside $6.5 million worth of its native FTM ([FTM](https://cointelegraph.com/fantom-ftm-price-index)) token as a reward to devs as it tries to get a slice of the nearly $50 billion sector.

Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong told Cointelegraph he wants to create "an environment where people can launch what we call ‘safer memecoins’” and introduce technical and non-technical measures to ensure projects aren’t “just an outright rug or scam.”

Solana and Coinbase’s Ethereum layer 2 Base have [seen the bulk](https://cointelegraph.com/news/trader-earns-23-million-profit-solana-memecoin-trading) of the recent memecoin trading craze with trading volumes on Solana even [surpassing Ethereum’s](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-activity-flips-ethereum-memecoin-frenzy) at the peak of the memecoin rush in March.

However, as many as [one in six of memecoins](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/base-meme-coins-scams-vulnerabilities-honeypot/) on Base were revealed to be scams and at least 12 sizeable meme-based projects on Solana — which raised a combined $26.7 million — were [quickly abandoned](https://cointelegraph.com/news/12-solana-presale-memecoins-abandoned-after-one-month) by their creators.

In a bid to attract memecoin traders to Fantom as well as increasing safety measures around the tokens, Kong announced during the April 30 MemeGlobal event in Sydney that the Fantom Foundation was setting up a 10 million Fantom ([FTM](https://cointelegraph.com/fantom-ftm-price-index)) prize pool — worth $6.5 million — to memecoin teams.

“The memecoin phenomenon that exists right now is a method for us to acquire a lot of customers because we’ve seen that be successful with other chains and we want to replicate that success,” Kong said.

“For us as a chain, our interest is to grow the chain as much as possible and that comes down to customer acquisition,” Kong added.

&gt; “In the end, it’s about what the customer wants. If the customer wants DeFi, give them DeFi. NFTs? Give them NFTs, and when it comes to memecoins, give them memecoins — or at least an environment that allows people to develop memecoins in a safe manner.”

Kong described a successful memecoin as one with a “democratic launch where you release a lot of tokens to give to the community” and aren’t “heavily concentrated in a few whales or a few bags.”

The Foundation’s co-founder Andre Cronje [proposed](https://andrecronje.medium.com/safer-community-meme-coins-9cda6f882c59) measures for safe memecoins earlier in April including memecoin devs issuing their token with the Fanton Foundation as a co-controller of the token’s startup liquidity.

**_Related:_** [**_Crypto VC sees a ‘new class’ of profitable memecoins this cycle_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-profitable-memecoins-crypto-vc-founder-dogecoin-politics)

Cronje also proposed the token supply split — 5% to the team and 10% for marketing that’s locked in a multi-sig wallet needing at least one Foundation member as a co-signer.

The remaining 85% would be placed in an FTM paired [liquidity pool](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained) (LP) with the Foundation pitching in 100,000 FTM — worth around $65,000 at current prices.

“Should the FTM in the LP token reach at least 2,000,000 FTM, the original provided 100,000 FTM (5%) will be removed to cover the initial cost and the rest of the LP will be burned,” Cronje wrote.

Fantom is the 38th largest blockchain network with a total value locked (TVL) of $108.3 million, [according](https://defillama.com/chains) to DefiLlama. For comparison, Solana and Base are respectively the fourth and sixth largest by TVL.

Bitcoin has declined approximately 20% over the past three months, but crypto traders are unfazed, claiming it is just a routine correction in the market cycle.

“This is the 4th 20% correction in BTC in 12 months...pretty ordinary stuff,” the CEO of Real Vision, Raoul Pal, stated in an April 30 [post](https://twitter.com/raoulgmi/status/1785328306247569450?s=46&amp;t=MuRujqZUAz3TQE1vmr3c6A) on X — comparing its current price level to when Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) hit its all-time high of $75,830 on March 14.

“This is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle,” pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital wrote in a [post](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785370455706063233) on the same day.

“Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet,” [added](https://x.com/thomas_fahrer/status/1785450839815147634) Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of crypto-focused reviews portal Apollo.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $59,730 after falling 6% over the past 24 hours, [according](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin had a brief stint below support levels, trading at $59,097, which resulted in the liquidation of $96.5 million in long positions, [according](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) to CoinGlass data.

Bitcoin’s price is “getting closer and closer to its final bottom with each additional -1% to the downside,” commented Rekt in a separate X [post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785396823558868998) on the same day.

Ben Simpson, the CEO of Collective Shift, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the market may now be in a “lull period” after the recent Bitcoin halving due to a lack of new narratives for traders.

However, he remains optimistic about the market’s long-term prospects beyond the next few months.

&gt; “I believe in the next month or two we are going to see some choppiness sideways, and a continued drawdown, especially when we still have macro uncertainty, we have the rate Fed decision, the ongoing war, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market.”

Other traders have also pointed to bullish indicators forming on Bitcoin’s price chart which could signal a breakout in the next few months.

Crypto trader Gally Sama pointed out the forming cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin’s price chart — when the price falls and then rebounds in a u-shaped recovery, which looks like a cup — stating that the handle is forming “around or above the previous highs.”

The overall crypto market also faced widespread corrections alongside Bitcoin, with Ether ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) falling by 7.4%, Solana’s ([SOL](https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index)) dropping by 10.1% and Dogecoin ([DOGE](https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index)) falling by 10.1%.

**_Related:_** [**_Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-integrates-lightning-network-bitcoin-transactions)

The market decline has led to a drop in overall investor confidence over the past 24 hours, [according](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) to the Fear and Greed Index.

On May 1, the index score fell to a “neutral” 54 — the lowest it has been in three months — dropping 13 points from April 30 “greed” score of 67.

Markdown Content:
As the cryptocurrency market braces for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a prominent crypto analyst has made a bold prediction about **Bitcoin**‘s BTC/USD immediate future.

**What Happened**: **Micahël van de Poppe**, a well-known crypto analyst, took to social media platform X to share his forecast for Bitcoin’s immediate future. Van de Poppe anticipates a potential dip in the price of Bitcoin, with a possible range of $55,000 to $58,000 before a rebound.

Van de Poppe’s post read, “Monthly close approaching for #Bitcoin and FOMC day tomorrow. I think we’ll see that sweep beneath $60K and potentially cascade towards $55-58K from which we’re finding the low and rotate back upwards. From there: **Ethereum** ETH/USD ETF hype in May to pick up momentum.”

This prediction comes at a time when the market is experiencing a “[horrendous slow bleed](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38528542/bitcoin-dogecoin-shiba-inu-pumped-after-the-last-fomc-meeting-will-history-repeat-on-wedne),” with most cryptocurrencies closing in the red for 15 out of the last 20 days, according to pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader **Kevin**.

**Why It Matters**: The upcoming FOMC meeting is expected to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. Kevin, in a recent tweet, emphasized the [importance of the meeting](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38528542/bitcoin-dogecoin-shiba-inu-pumped-after-the-last-fomc-meeting-will-history-repeat-on-wedne) as a potential catalyst for the next significant market move.

Van de Poppe’s prediction also aligns with his previous insights on market rotations and [altcoin seasons](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38523300/crypto-trader-michael-van-de-poppe-highlights-runs-in-solana-meme-coins-predicts-there-is-). He believes that by identifying opportunities in altcoins and strategically rotating profits back into Bitcoin, investors can outperform the market and maintain their purchasing power in the face of inflation.

However, the market has also [seen some turbulence](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38535711/bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-arrested-in-spain-on-tax-evasion-charges) with the recent arrest of **Roger Ver**, a prominent figure in the early days of Bitcoin, in Spain on tax evasion charges.

**Price Action**: Bitcoin is currently trading at $59,730, experiencing a 1.47% decline over the last 24 hours but showing a remarkable 35.22% increase year-to-date. Meanwhile, Ether is trading at $2,977, down 1.13% in the past 24 hours, yet still reflecting a solid 26.54% gain year-to-date, according to data [from Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard).

URL Source: https://cryptopotato.com/uniswap-dex-captures-37-of-ethereum-l2-volume/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T04:15:35+00:00

Markdown Content:
Uniswap, the most widely used Layer 2 decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on Ethereum, now accounts for approximately 37% of the total trading volume on L2.

This represents a remarkable increase compared to the trading volumes observed two years ago.

Uniswap L2 Volumes Surged Over 650%
-----------------------------------

In a post on X, Tom Wan, a researcher at 21.co, noted the growth of Uniswap’s layer 2 (L2) volume, which has surged by more than 650% over the past 24 months. This increase saw its volume climb from approximately $4 billion in 2022 to over $30 billion this year.

&gt; .[@Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)‘s trading volume is growing on L2s and currently contributes to 37% of the total volume
&gt; 
&gt; Since 2022, Uniswap’s volume on L2s has grown from $4B to $30B (+650%). Uniswap’s L2s volume in 2022 only contributes to 5.2% of the total volume
&gt; 
&gt; L2s have been gaining more… [pic.twitter.com/PR7GT9xdih](https://t.co/PR7GT9xdih)
&gt; 
&gt; — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) [April 29, 2024](https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1784929074122539111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Wan suggested that this trend could continue to strengthen, especially with the launch of more quality protocols on [Layer 2 networks](https://cryptopotato.com/ethereums-layer-2-networks-projected-to-reach-1t-market-cap-by-2030-vaneck-analysts/) such as Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base, and Optimism.

[![Image 1: blockdrop unlocking bitcoin mining for everyone claim your airdrop](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4150113)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=183000&amp;plid=2399417&amp;setID=631314&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=880818&amp;banID=521892882&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2317939&amp;adSize=300x250&amp;mt=1714546192125522&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2Funiswap-dex-captures-37-of-ethereum-l2-volume%2F&amp;hc=033b8e9dd46aea5fa52e4cbffcaeed5bc29d437a&amp;location=)

According to Wan, L2s, notably Base and Arbitrum, have witnessed a surge in economic activities, accounting for 82% of the total L2 volume on Uniswap. Wan anticipates that the dominance of L2 volume on Uniswap will likely grow to 50% by the end of the year.

Although Uniswap has contributed only 2.9% of the total volume on altcoin layer 1s, Wan believes this narrative could evolve. He explained that high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer 1s, combined with a multichain expansion strategy, could enable the DEX to capture more volume on networks like Sei and Monad.

Uniswap, the first decentralized exchange on Ethereum, continues to [maintain](https://cryptopotato.com/5-years-later-uniswap-surpasses-2-trillion-milestone-in-trading-volume/) its position as the largest on-chain trading venue on the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain. The protocol has facilitated over $2 trillion in cumulative trading volume across 17 chains. According to DefiLlama [data](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap#information), users have deposited more than $5.5 billion in total value-locked on Uniswap.

Uniswap Faces SEC Regulatory Pressure
-------------------------------------

Uniswap, amid its ongoing success, is [facing](https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-wild-ride-around-70k-uniswap-v-sec-clash-in-the-making-and-more-this-weeks-crypto-recap/) regulatory pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of a broader regulatory crackdown on the crypto-exchange market.

The SEC has issued a Wells Notice to Uniswap, indicating a probable enforcement action. Despite this development, Uniswap intends to defend itself against what it considers a “disappointing but not surprising” decision.

This lawsuit comes amid widespread criticism from the crypto industry regarding the SEC’s approach. Many argue that the SEC has been operating in bad faith. Critics contend that the SEC has pursued enforcement actions without considering the unique characteristics of blockchain-based technology in the crypto sector.

In response, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has [defended](https://cryptopotato.com/sec-files-notice-of-intent-to-sue-uniswap-labs/) the SEC’s actions, asserting that existing securities laws are clear and that the crypto sector has sought special treatment while failing to comply.

Meanwhile, UNI is trading at $7.68, up 0.9% in the last 24 hours but down 6% over the last week.

**On April 30, 2024, Hong Kong entered into spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with a mix of excitement and prudence. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) launched six new spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.**

These ETFs, issued by China Asset Management, Bosera HashKey, and Harvest International, are a remarkable achievement for Asia’s crypto market. However, the first trading day was relatively muted compared to its US counterparts.

A Mixed Bag for Hong Kong’s Spot Crypto ETFs
--------------------------------------------

A local media outlet [reported](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1797754125241872006&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc) the initial launch size of ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (CAM BTC) and ChinaAMC Ether ETF (CAM ETH) were HKD 950 million and HKD 160 million, respectively. Furthermore, data from Bloomberg Intelligence revealed that CAM BTC ETF recorded $123.61 million in total assets.

These numbers showcase CAM BTC’s position as the day’s largest launch, with an increase of 1.53% in its closing price. Conversely, CAM ETH dipped by 0.78%.

Similarly, Bosera Hashkey and Harvest International experienced a mix of slight gains and modest losses across their respective ETF offerings.

The Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF appreciated by 1.80%, while its Ethereum ETF fell by 0.45%. Meanwhile, Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (HGI BTC) and Harvest Ether Spot ETF (HGI ETH) observed upticks of 1.57% and downticks of 0.73%, respectively.

Data from Arkham Intelligence [showed](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/bosera-funds) that Bosera Hashkey’s ETFs hold approximately $70.34 million of assets. These assets comprise 964 Bitcoin (~$57.55 million) and 4,290 Ethereum (~$12.80 million).

These outcomes suggest a higher appeal for [Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-gold-rival/) than Ethereum variants on the first trading day.

The [Hong Kong ETF issuers](https://beincrypto.com/hong-kong-spot-bitcoin-etfs-trading-hkex/) have adopted diverse strategies in management fees to stand out in the competitive market. For instance, Harvest International has notably set a low management fee of 0.3% for its ETFs, a rate that is waived for the first six months post-listing.

In contrast, ChinaAMC has opted for a standard fee of 0.99%. They also implement different issue prices and trading conditions for their customers.

Undeniably, these ETFs have enriched the product offerings in Hong Kong’s stock market. They also opened up new avenues for professional and retail investors. BeInCrypto reported that these ETFs are available in multiple currencies, including Hong Kong dollars (HKD), US dollars, and Renminbi (RMB).

Moreover, the ETFs are also available to international investors who meet local compliance standards. Yet, [mainland Chinese investors](https://beincrypto.com/china-crypto-ban-hong-kong-bitcoin-etf/) currently face barriers to accessing Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs.

The Long-Term Game: Experts Weigh In
------------------------------------

Although listing spot ETFs presents a notable step forward for [Hong Kong’s position as a crypto hub](https://beincrypto.com/hong-kong-singapore-battle-crypto-hub/), market observers offer mixed assessments. Guillermo Fernandes, founder and CEO of Blockpliance, shared his perspectives.

&gt; “Hong Kong has long served as the financial capital of Asia … For this reason, launching crypto ETFs in that market is not something that should be taken lightly, especially because they’ve approved Ethereum ETFs before the US was able to do so. Having said that, the US continues to be the largest financial market in the world, so it is natural that most of the large institution investors who wanted to add Bitcoin exposure to their portfolios have chosen to do it via the US market instead of Hong Kong,” Fernandes explained to BeInCrypto.

Although the first day’s trading was somewhat subdued, these spot ETFs offer a promising new avenue for investors in Hong Kong and potentially the broader Asia-Pacific region to engage with cryptocurrency markets.

Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, [advised](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1785324704179368374) tempering expectations about Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs. However, he believes that the numbers are impressive on a local scale.

Additionally, it is expected that investors from mainland China will try to find ways around local restrictions to take advantage of investment opportunities. Fernandes highlighted that Hong Kong is a popular destination for Chinese investors as it offers simpler Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and the convenience of similar time zones and points of contact. These factors are considered an advantage compared to the [more stringent scrutiny faced in the US](https://beincrypto.com/sec-bitcoin-etf-options-ethereum-etf/).

Binance's CZ gets four months in prison for anti-money laundering failures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Former** [**Binance CEO**](https://coinpaprika.com/news/doj-demands-3-year-sentence-for-binance-ceo/) **Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, will serve a four-month prison term** for failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering controls at the cryptocurrency exchange.

This sentence, issued in Seattle, is much lighter than the three-year term prosecutors had requested for what they considered a severe violation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

During the sentencing hearing, **Judge Richard Jones noted CZ's background as a philanthropist and first-time lawbreaker**, significantly influencing his decision.

Before the hearing, Judge Jones reviewed numerous letters portraying CZ positively, emphasizing his charitable efforts and personal integrity.

CZ becomes **the first CEO imprisoned under the BSA**, signaling the gravity of Binance's oversight in anti-money laundering practices.

Despite his contributions to global charity, prosecutors argued that these actions do not excuse legal violations, a point the defense contested by highlighting his voluntary surrender and cooperation.

Judge Jones acknowledged the overwhelming support for CZ, which was evident from the many letters he received describing him as a compassionate yet flawed individual.

**CZ's defense stressed his clean legal history and proactive engagement with the legal process**, including his decision to face charges despite living in a non-extradition country.

**The judge clarified that CZ's role at** [**Binance**](https://coinpaprika.com/news/binance-stops-listing-monero-and-others/) **did not exempt him from following the law**, pointing out that his wealth and status do not place him above legal responsibilities.

Despite the prison term, CZ plans to continue his philanthropic work, particularly his global education initiative for children.

This indicates that this setback is likely only a brief interruption in his career.

![Image 1: Shiba Inu: THIS indicates price rise - What moves should you make?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _Exchange data suggested that SHIB’s price might rise to $0.000026 in a few weeks._
*   _The low NVT ratio indicated that the token remained undervalued._

The number of [Shiba Inu \[SHIB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/shiba-inu-news/) tokens on exchanges has been decreasing since the last days of March, AMBCrypto found.

Using Glassnode’s provided Exchange Balance total, we noticed that the metric was 146.67 trillion before April began.

However, press time data [showed](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=SHIB&amp;category=Distribution&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchanges&amp;s=1698746371&amp;u=1714471171&amp;zoom=182) that the Exchange Balance was 140.66 trillion, meaning that about 6 trillion SHIB have left these platforms.

#### Calm is coming

Typically, these withdrawals were supposed to cushion the effect of selling pressure. However, that was not the situation. In the last 30 days, SHIB lost 25.34% of its value, but the decline was widespread in the market.

However, if the balance on exchange continues to drop, there is a high chance for Shiba Inu to recover.

While that might not happen in the next few days, traders might need to keep an eye on the broader market sentiment in May.

[![Image 2: Shiba Inu's low NVT ratio shows a bullish sign](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201800%201013'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shiba-inu-price-and-exchange-balance.png)

Source: Glassnode

Should the sentiment tilt bullish, then the price of SHIB might surpass $0.000026 for a start. When we examined the difference in exchange inflow and outflow, it gave a [similar sign](https://app.santiment.net/charts/CjaKV0cB__sCl).

According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment, Shiba Inu’s exchange inflow was 200.27 million. This metric is the number of tokens sent into exchanges.

If it increases, it increases the chances of a price [decline](https://ambcrypto.com/will-shiba-inu-fall-to-bears-analyzing-whats-ahead-for-shib/). If the exchange inflow drops, then the opposite happens.

The exchange outflow, at the opposite end, was 683.91 million. With the Shiba Inu inflow 3x less than the outflow, it is expected that SHIB might face less selling pressure in the days to come.

[![Image 3: SHIB's decreasing exchange inflow](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%20867'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shib-exchange-inflow-and-outflow.png)

#### SHIB aims to hit $0.000040

Another metric AMBCrypto decided to examine was the NVT Ratio. NVT is an acronym for Network Value Transaction. This metric divides the market cap of a project by the on-chain volume transferred.

If the result of this division gives a high ratio, it means investors are paying a premium for a token. In this case, we can say that the price could be overvalued relative to the market condition.

On the other hand, a low NVT ratio signals [undervaluation](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=SHIB&amp;category=&amp;m=indicators.Nvt&amp;s=1706704015&amp;u=1714480015&amp;zoom=90). At press time, Shiba Inu’s NVT Ratio was down to 107.72, indicating that the price might increase.

[![Image 4: Shiba Inu's low NVT ratio shows a bullish sign](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201800%201013'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shiba-inu-nvt-ratio.png)

Sources: Glassnode

However, the metric can decrease from this point. If that is the case, SHIB’s [projected rebound](https://ambcrypto.com/shiba-inu-price-prediction-all-about-shibs-latest-buy-opportunity/) could be harder.

In February, when the NVT Ratio was 45.48, the price of the token climbed from $0.000010 and hit $0.000035 by the first week in March.

Read [Shiba Inu’s \[SHIB\] Price Prediction](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction) 2024-2025

* * *

Taking the event into consideration, SHIB might try to replicate the performance. If validated, the price of the cryptocurrency might rally past $0.000040.

In the long-term, this potential rise could be better, as SHIB might aim to delete one zero again.

_Polkadot (DOT) is showing bearish signs below the $8 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could extend its decline if it fails to stay above $6.00._

*   DOT is gaining pace below the $8.80 and $8.00 levels against the US Dollar.
*   The price is trading below the $7.20 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
*   There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $6.50 on the 4-hour chart of the DOT/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
*   The pair could continue to decline toward the $5.00 support zone.

Polkadot Price Resumes Drop
---------------------------

After a steady increase, DOT price faced resistance near the $7.60 zone. It formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below the $7.00 level, like [Ethereum](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-plunges-2800/) and [Bitcoin](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-nosedives-60k/).

There was a move below the $6.20 support zone. A low was formed near $6.03 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is slowly moving higher above the $6.35 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $7.58 swing high to the $6.03 low.

DOT is now trading below the $7.00 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $6.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $6.50 on the 4-hour chart of the DOT/USD pair.

The next major resistance is near $7.00 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $7.58 swing high to the $6.03 low. A successful break above $7.00 could start another strong rally. In the stated case, the price could easily rally toward $8.20 in the near term. The next major resistance is seen near the $10.00 zone.

More Downsides in DOT?
----------------------

If DOT price fails to start a fresh increase above $7.00, it could continue to move down. The first key support is near the $6.00 level.

The next major support is near the $5.65 level, below which the price might decline to $5.00. Any more losses may perhaps open the doors for a move toward the $4.20 support zone or the trend line.

**According to blockchain investigator ZachXBT,** [**North Korea's**](https://coinpaprika.com/news/north-koreas-alleged-crypto-move-to-blackrock-creates-global-stir/) **Lazarus Group was implicated in laundering $200 million through cryptocurrency hacks** between August 2020 and October 2023.

The group utilized advanced laundering techniques like coin mixers and peer-to-peer exchanges.

ZZachXBT's report revealed that **the group masked the origins of stolen funds from over 25 breaches across various blockchain platforms**.

They predominantly used the [Ethereum](https://coinpaprika.com/news/ethereum-s-big-update-brings-price-close-to-2-400/) mixer Tornado Cash and the Bitcoin-based ChipMixer.

Moreover, [**Lazarus**](https://coinpaprika.com/news/35-million-atomic-wallet-hack-traced-to-north-korea-s-infamous-cyber-hacking-group-and-their-secret-crypto-mixer/) **converted substantial amounts of cryptocurrency into fiat currency via peer-to-peer platforms**, with linked accounts receiving $44 million.

Usernames "asyGoatfish351" and "airJunco470" were identified as part of these transactions.

The group is known for orchestrating some of the most **significant digital heists, with thefts totaling over $3 billion**.

The United Nations Security Council claims these funds support North Korea's weaponry initiatives, underscoring the broader security risks.

Matera raises $3.6M to merge DeFi with social media, aiming to grow the creator economy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web3 company **Matera has raised $3.6 million** to merge decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinpaprika.com/news/defi-platform-stops-operation/)) with current social media to boost the creator economy.

According to a CryptoSlate press release, this funding aims to solve the issue of making money within the creator economy and propel its worth to over $1 trillion by 2030.

Investors such as Sidedoor Ventures, HighCass Crypto, Medusa Ventures, The Sandbox, and Saxon Partners supported the funding round.

Matera aims to fuse DeFi with popular social media platforms, **transforming how creators earn money** and engage with their followers.

This method uses traditional platforms' existing user base and market reach while integrating Web3's innovative economic models, thus boosting the potential economic value of creator networks without replacing existing platforms.

Rather than starting anew, Matera will introduce DeFi solutions to improve these platforms.

A key innovation is the **Matera Credit Score**, which rates creators based on their interactions across various platforms. This score can be used to access funds and rewards within Matera’s system.

Matera’s CEO, Sam Huber, noted the challenge Web3 SocialFi faces due to the underestimated network effects of Web2 platforms.

He emphasized the **high costs for creators** to switch and start anew on different platforms, despite better financial terms.

Matera plans to bridge this gap, merging the reach of web2 with web3’s economics to address this issue.

The company expects its approach to **drastically grow the creator economy**, aiming to bring 100 million creators and their followers into the blockchain by 2030.

Matera is also developing a **robust blockchain infrastructure** that includes a DeFi platform, a protocol layer, and a layer-2 network for better scalability and efficiency.

Currently, Matera supports creators on X (formerly Twitter), helping them raise funds and monetize their fan base.

The company intends to expand these services to more social media platforms soon, widening its influence in the creator economy.

URL Source: https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/uk-authorities-granted-expanded-powers-to-combat-crypto-crime-including-asset-seizure-without-arrest/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T04:33:54+00:00

Markdown Content:
The United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency ([NCA](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/)) and police have been granted expanded authority to deal with cryptocurrency used for illicit activities, including the power to “seize, freeze, and destroy” such digital assets.

Under the new regulations, law enforcement in the UK will no longer need to make an arrest prior to confiscating crypto holdings.

Macro Taking 'Wind' Out of Crypto: Starkiller's Drogen

In a statement released by the UK Home Office, it was disclosed that police can now also seize materials such as passwords or memory sticks that could assist in ongoing investigations.

Additionally, UK law enforcement will have the capability to eliminate a crypto asset if reintroducing it into circulation is deemed harmful to the public interest.

Effective from April 26, the new laws authorize the police to transfer seized illicit cryptocurrency to wallets under their control, with provisions for crime victims to seek reimbursement from their crypto accounts.

UK Home Secretary James Cleverly emphasized the necessity of preventing criminals from profiting from illegal activities, citing the use of cryptocurrency fundraising by various groups as a key driver behind the introduction of these enhanced police powers.

Cleverly underscored the potential national security implications, citing instances where terrorist organizations like Daesh have been known to finance their operations through crypto transactions, highlighting the importance of enabling agencies to more effectively strip them of their assets.

The enactment of these regulations follows the passage of a crime bill by the UK parliament in 2023, which facilitated the swift seizure of cryptocurrency assets.

Privacy coins were singled out in the press release as being particularly detrimental to the public good.

While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) offer pseudo-anonymity through public ledgers, privacy coins afford users a higher degree of anonymity.

Despite the anonymity associated with wallet addresses, it was noted that once linked to an individual’s identity through procedures like Know Your Customer (KYC), all transactions conducted through that wallet can be traced and identified.

The announcement acknowledged that cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been exploited by drug dealers and fraudsters, leading to various investigations.

However, the new measures aim to curtail the exploitation of crypto for illicit purposes while fostering its legitimate potential to drive economic growth.

This concerted effort to regulate crypto is not unique to the UK, as evidenced by recent actions taken by law enforcement globally, including the arrest of the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet in the United States on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering on April 24.

Indonesia's election winners vow to boost crypto sector, eyeing regional competitiveness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Indonesia's**](https://coinpaprika.com/news/police-raids-10-sites-for-illegal-bitcoin-mining/) **presidential election concluded in February 2024, resulting in a win for Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming**, who are seen as proponents of the cryptocurrency industry.

Key industry figures echoed this sentiment, believing their victory could positively affect the country's crypto sector.

**Subani from CFX and William Sutanto of INDODAX expressed optimism** about the new administration's impact on the crypto landscape.

Subianto has pledged to tighten regulations to curb tax evasion, while Rakabuming aims to nurture blockchain expertise among the youth.

**Both leaders are committed to fostering the cryptocurrency environment**, as confirmed after their official declaration as winners by the electoral commission on April 25.

There's a general expectation that they will maintain or enhance the existing crypto-friendly policies.

**Sutanto highlighted Rakabuming's potential to drive innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors**, particularly given his appeal to the younger generation and strategic planning capabilities.

Sutanto hopes the new government will strongly endorse digital assets, enabling Indonesia to compete with regional players like [Thailand](https://coinpaprika.com/news/thailand-delays-plan-to-share-crypto/), the Philippines, and Vietnam.

**Despite not leading in transaction volumes, Indonesia has seen significant growth in registered crypto users** under President Joko Widodo, Rakabuming's father.

Widodo’s administration established the world's first national crypto exchange and a comprehensive tax framework, suggesting future tax incentives for crypto transactions.

These developments lay a promising groundwork for the new leaders, potentially elevating Indonesia’s position in the regional crypto market.

Each event promises to provide a comprehensive overview of the burgeoning ICP ecosystem, bootstrapping collaboration and innovation on a global scale.

**ICP HUBS NETWORK: A Year of Remarkable Progress**
---------------------------------------------------

In just one year, the ICP HUBS NETWORK has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving into a global decentralized network comprising 24 chapters with a presence in 40 countries. This unprecedented reach underscores the growing influence of Internet Computer as a driving force in the Web3 landscape.

Central to this expansion is the philosophy of “glocal” empowerment, emphasizing grassroots community development and regional adoption. Through a network of decentralized hubs, ICP is redefining how stakeholders engage with blockchain technology, fostering collaboration and innovation from the ground up.

Representing a departure from traditional, centralized approaches, the ICP HUBS NETWORK signals a paradigm shift toward community-driven innovation and empowerment in the crypto world.

This announcement at the MemeGlobal event on April 30 marks a significant pivot towards safer and more structured meme coin launches within the crypto industry.**

He emphasizes the need for ethical content and substantial community involvement in these initiatives. This also includes a comprehensive vetting process by Cronje himself. Therefore, it will ensure that all projects are free from offensive content and do not reference real individuals or existing projects.

[Cronje’s framework for meme coin](https://beincrypto.com/fantom-andre-cronje-eyes-meme-coins/) launches is designed to instill fairness and [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) from the outset. The foundation will lock about 85% of the tokens from each project in a Fantom/token liquidity pool (LP). Moreover, it will secure and manage them with multisig technology.

Fantom’s entry into the meme coin market is timely. Similar initiatives have spurred significant growth in other blockchain ecosystems, such as [Solana](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/). On April 15, [Solana saw a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://beincrypto.com/solana-dexs-volume-resurgen/) activities, with trading volume exceeding the $1 billion mark.

However, the [meme coin arena has its challenges](https://beincrypto.com/solana-dex-volume-meme-coin-risks/). The recent history of the Solana network serves as a cautionary tale, as the abandonment of meme coin projects led to substantial financial losses for investors. A recent report uncovered that [12 Solana-based meme coin projects were abandoned](https://beincrypto.com/crypto-founders-ditch-projects/), resulting in a staggering $26.7 million loss.

He plans to focus on education post-release, affirming continued cryptocurrency investment. Despite DOJ's proposed 3-year term, Judge Richard Jones opted for leniency, citing lack of evidence of awareness of unlawful activities. The decision sparked debates on justice in the crypto industry.

*   Fox's Eleanor Terrett reports optimism from issuers of leveraged ETH futures ETFs regarding SEC approval. Allegations of Ethereum as a security contrast SEC's past stance. Volatility Shares' 2x Ether Strategy ETF ($ETHU) plans June launch pending SEC approval. Gensler's view conflicts with SEC's previous classification. Consensys lawsuit challenges SEC's stance.

*   Litecoin's Charlie Lee anticipates a spot LTC ETF approval by the SEC, citing similarities with Bitcoin. Lee expects initial demand disparities but foresees long-term optimism. Ethereum's PoS status complicates ETF approval, facing SEC delays and potential denials. Lee believes Ethereum's broader utility could drive higher demand if approved.

*   Australia's ASX may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs from VanEck Australia and BetaShares by 2024 end, following U.S. and Hong Kong trends. Confidence from $53B AUM in U.S. ETFs drives Australian launches. Monochrome predicts $3-4B inflows in 3 years, citing demand from fund managers, SMSF investors, and retail.

*   Lazarus Group, allegedly linked to North Korea, laundered $200M in stolen Bitcoin using sophisticated methods like coin mixers. Their use of platforms like Tornado Cash and Railgun raises concerns about blockchain security. North Korean hackers stole over $600M in crypto in 2023, highlighting their significant impact on the industry.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has discussed a new cryptographic proving system that aims to achieve greater efficiency for zero-knowledge proofs. 

In a blog post on April 29, Buterin [explained](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/29/binius.html) a system for highly efficient cryptographic proofs over binary fields called “Binius,” which aims to deliver significant performance gains over traditional proof systems such as zk-SNARKs.

Binius aims to achieve greater efficiency by performing computations directly over individual binary bits — zeros and ones — instead of larger numbers.

The motivation behind the system stems from the traditional [cryptographic proof systems](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained) like SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and STARKs (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) working with larger numbers such as 64-bit or 256-bit integers.

Underlying data being processed often consists of small values like counters, indices, and boolean flags, however, by operating on bits directly, Binius can process this data more efficiently, Buterin said.

According to [Buterin](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/who-is-vitalik-buterin), the new proving system offers improvements such as representing data as a multidimensional “hypercube” of bits and using binary “finite fields” to allow for efficient arithmetic operations on bits and bit sequences.

It also employs a specialized encoding and decoding process that converts the bit-level data into a form suitable for “polynomial” processing and Merkle proofs, while maintaining the efficiency benefits of working in binary.

The binary system unlocks significant improvements for the core arithmetic of cryptographic proof systems making complex crypto applications more efficient and scalable.

Polynomials are often used in zk-proofs to encode data and computations in a way that allows for the verification of proofs without revealing the underlying information, hence the term “zero knowledge.”

Buterin demonstrated the Binius protocol with complex mathematics beyond the scope of this article to show how it encodes data, generates proofs, and allows verifiers to check those proofs efficiently.

**_Related:_** [**_ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developers_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zk-proofs-security-challenges-for-developers)

The concept was initially [proposed](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1784) by cryptographers Benjamin E. Diamond and Jim Posen in a 2023 whitepaper titled “Succinct Arguments over Towers of Binary Fields.”

Overall, Binius aims to bring about significant performance gains over more traditional proof systems, especially for computations involving small values and bit-level operations.

“I expect many more improvements in binary-field-based proving techniques in the months ahead,” Buterin concluded.

In the crypto landscape of 2024, the strong comeback of meme coins has been one of the most striking developments for internet-related tokens. 

These tokens, often inspired by viral images and Internet memes, have not only captured the attention of the public but have also generated surprising financial returns for investors who have seized the opportunity at the right time.

*   [Conclusions](#Conclusions"Conclusions")

Dogwifhat (WIF): the current meme coin token
--------------------------------------------

At the top of the list of the most profitable meme coins is Dogwifhat ([WIF](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogwifhat/)). Launched on the Solana blockchain at the end of 2023, it saw its value skyrocket in 2024, recording an impressive increase of almost 2,000% compared to the launch price.

With a market cap that has exceeded 3 billion dollars, WIF has positioned itself among the top 40 tokens by market capitalization. The peak was reached in March, when its market value touched 4.75 billion dollars. 

Based on the viral image of a dog with a pink hat, WIF has drawn its strength mainly from the community that has formed around the token, even though intrinsically the project offers limited additional value to investors.

Bonk (BONK): The Surprise of the Year
-------------------------------------

Another rising star has been Bonk (BONK), also a product of the Solana ecosystem and based on the image of a dog. The success of BONK has been lightning-fast, with a growth that has exceeded 23,000% since its launch. Much of this growth occurred in 2024, consolidating BONK as one of the brightest novelties of the year.

### Other Notable Meme Coin Tokens

*   Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have continued to make waves in the meme coin landscape, capturing interest thanks to strong online communities and significant value increases.
*   Book of Meme (BOME) and Jeo Boden (BODEN) were two other tokens that attracted attention. BODEN in particular, inspired by Joe Biden, has managed to earn a place in the hearts of investors, despite the lack of a clear intrinsic value beyond entertainment and political satire.

The Pioneers: Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)
--------------------------------------------------

The two original meme coins, Dogecoin and [Shiba Inu](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/29/shiba-inu-meme-coin-the-latest-crypto-news-and-price-performance/), have also recorded positive performances in 2024. Dogecoin has seen a 70% increase while Shiba Inu has surprised with a 150% increase. Although these gains may seem modest compared to other new entries, they demonstrate the resilience and continued popularity of these tokens.

2024 has been a year of renewed optimism for the [cryptocurrency market](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/categoria/crypto/), partly thanks to the approval of ETFs on [Bitcoin](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/categoria/crypto/bitcoin/), significant updates to the [Ethereum](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/categoria/crypto/ethereum/) network, and a general positive atmosphere. These developments have helped reignite interest in meme coins, considered by many as a promising sector for short-term speculation and investments.

Solana has continued to dominate the meme coin sector, attracting billions of dollars in new investments. At the same time, platforms like Coinbase’s layer-2 have facilitated the creation and launch of new tokens, demonstrating how blockchain technology can be accessible and usable by a wider audience.

Conclusions
-----------

The meme coin rally in 2024 was one of the most fascinating and surprising narratives of the year. 

These tokens have generated incredible amounts of value for bold investors. 

However, it is essential to remember that the sector remains highly volatile and risky. 

Investors should proceed with caution, arming themselves with research and a careful evaluation of risks before diving into these often turbulent waters.

Kraken is a famous American crypto exchange. 

It is one of the oldest, as the company was founded in 2011 in San Francisco, only two years after the creation of Bitcoin. 

Actually, if we only consider the crypto exchanges still in full operation, it is one of the very few still existing among those founded before the first Bitcoin halving in 2012.

*   [The guide](#The_guide"Theguide")

The history of the crypto exchange Kraken
-----------------------------------------

The real crypto exchange, however, was launched only in September 2013, two years after the company was founded and in the midst of a bull market, and at that time it only offered exchanges in Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC). Then over time it greatly expanded its catalog. 

By the way, its co-founder Jesse Powell was a consultant for Mt. Gox before founding [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us), and Mt. Gox was the very first known exchange in the world that allowed the public buying and selling of Bitcoin, already in 2010.

With the closure of [Mt. Gox](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/23/great-news-for-bitcoin-creditors-of-mt-gox/) in 2014, other crypto exchanges took its place, including Kraken. At the time, the vast majority of BTC exchanges were happening on Mt. Gox, so when it closed, it opened the floodgates for competitors.

Indeed, the following month Kraken raised 5 million dollars from Hummingbird Ventures and [Bitcoin](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/categoria/crypto/bitcoin-en/) Opportunity Fund through a Series A investment. A month later, it became one of the first crypto exchanges to be listed on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In 2020, it became the first crypto exchange to become a SPDI (Special Purpose Depository Institution) in the USA. 

Among US crypto exchanges, it is the second most important, behind Coinbase, although there are also other non-US exchanges operating in the USA that record higher trading volumes than Kraken, starting from Crypto.com. 

What sets [Kraken](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/19/kraken-expands-in-the-usa-by-acquiring-tradestation-crypto/) apart, however, is its adherence to US regulations, to the point that it is sometimes used for institutional purposes.

Furthermore, it also supports the euro, making it one of the most widely used crypto exchanges in Europe, thanks to its branches on the continent. 

Legal issues
------------

The exchange, like many others, has had to deal with various legal issues, especially in the United States of America. 

Actually, to tell the truth, Kraken’s relationship with authorities in the past has been a bit turbulent. 

However, over time it seems that they have been able to resolve them all, like last year’s against the SEC accusing him of offering investment contracts without the necessary authorizations (for example for staking services). 

So on one hand it is necessary to highlight that the crypto exchange has had to face several legal issues in the past, but on the other hand it is also important to underline that they all seem to have been resolved, although sometimes with agreements that did not necessarily provide a complete absolution for not having committed any wrongdoing. 

The advantages of the Kraken crypto exchange
--------------------------------------------

From a strictly technological point of view, Kraken does not seem to offer any particular advantages compared to other similar platforms. 

However, it offers a couple of advantages that may be interesting for some investors or speculators.

The first, as already mentioned, is compliance with regulations. 

Indeed, despite the fact that its actions have been contested several times from this point of view, in the end Kraken has always managed to come out of it in a way that complies with current regulations. 

So whoever chooses to use this exchange knows that in theory they should not run any risk, as far as US regulations are concerned. This level of compliance probably also applies to European markets, where Kraken is quite popular. 

The other advantage is the lack of major obstacles in the use of fiat currencies. 

When it comes to crypto exchange, various issues often arise with fiat currency transfers. Kraken seems to be one of the most reliable in this respect, also because it is quite well known to those who need to carry out these types of checks. 

Moreover, it does not have particularly high commissions, as sometimes happens with competitors, making it one of the best for deposits and withdrawals in dollars and euros. 

The features
------------

In addition to the classic spot crypto trading, in fiat currencies, stablecoins or other cryptos, the exchange also offers other features, but dedicated to a more advanced audience. 

First of all, they also allow trading of crypto futures. 

They also allow margin trading with leverage up to 5x. 

They also provide a Pro platform for more experienced users with greater needs, while the basic interface is dedicated to users with fewer needs or beginners. 

Moreover, it is also easily usable from the dedicated [smartphone app](https://www.kraken.com/it-it/features/cryptocurrency-apps), which makes its use very simple. However, Kraken offers its users three different apps, because in addition to the simple basic one, there is also the Pro version for more experienced users, and a [non-custodial wallet](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/18/kraken-launches-its-own-non-custodial-crypto-wallet/) for those who want to store their tokens without having to rely on them. 

One of the advanced level features they offer is Over-The-Counter (OTC) exchanges, designed for those who need to buy or sell very significant amounts of cryptocurrencies. 

Together with Coinbase, it is one of the largest OTC desks in the United States of America, precisely because of its high level of compliance. 

Also noteworthy is their customer service, which generally provides good quality service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

The guide
---------

Using the basic features of Kraken is practically the same as using those of other exchanges. 

What changes is mainly the use of the Pro version, intended for more advanced users. 

In this regard, they have published [a guide](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/7039277907092-Getting-started-with-Kraken-Pro) that allows you to become familiar with advanced features. 

It must be said that generally the basic version is primarily suitable for beginners, or for those who really only need a few basic features. 

Anyone with even slightly more complex needs would do well to learn how to use the Pro version, also because on the basic version there is always the risk of having to pay higher fees, or in any case dealing with larger spreads. However, this discussion applies to any crypto exchange, not just Kraken. 

There is also a [generic guide](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/204677947-Getting-Started) for the entire exchange that also includes basic functionalities, but these are perfectly in line with those of any other exchange. 

The exchange is available in five languages, including not only English but also Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Italian. After all, it is mainly used in America and Europe.

In this article we delve into the Birdeye platform: a tool that helps crypto trading enthusiasts research a wide range of on-chain data.

In particular, on Birdeye it is possible to find data related to market prices, volume, and depth of the less capitalized tokens, as well as social data and on-chain information.

The protocol also acts as an aggregator for cross-chain exchanges, relying on providers such as Mayan and Debridge. There is even a crypto airdrop at stake.  
Let’s see all the details below.

Birdeye crypto: the ideal platform for analyzing trading data of less capitalized tokens
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Birdeye is a platform founded in 2021 by Kha Nguyen, former head of product at Solscan, which acts as an **data aggregator** for the blockchains of [Solana](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/26/the-memecoin-airdrop-temporarily-reduces-the-cost-of-the-solana-phone-chapter-2/), Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche and BNB Chain, simplifying research and analysis in the field of crypto trading.

Through this tool **traders can take advantage of a complete suite of information** extracted and analyzed thanks to a variety of machine learning techniques and [artificial intelligence](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/categoria/ai-eng/).

Highlighted on the homepage of Birdeye are data regarding trending tokens in the last 24 hours, the most profitable cryptographic addresses in the last 7 days, and a chart comparing the historical performance of native tokens and many other coins.

Similar to [GeckoTerminal](https://www.geckoterminal.com/en), this platform also features a search bar where you can search for cryptocurrencies, addresses, and reference markets for in-depth trading analysis.

![Image 1: Birdeye crypto trading](https://cryptonomist.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-106-1024x351.png)

**Very interesting the “New Listings” function that allows you to discover the new tokens** added to the [liquidity pool](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/10/pyusd-the-rise-of-paypals-stablecoin-in-the-fraxpyusd-liquidity-pool-on-curve/) in order to expose yourself as an early trader of a coin.

Often the opportunities to make a 100x return on your investment (maybe better to say gambling) are found in the least capitalized cryptos at the time of their listing on the market. At the same time, the risks multiply in this kind of activity: [scams](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/25/231751/) are unfortunately commonplace.

**On Birdeye there is also a section called, “**_Find Gems_**“, which classifies all existing tokens based on customizable parameters** such as the most visited tokens, the most traded ones, those with the highest volumes, etc.

When we carry out this kind of research, we need to pay attention to the [TVL](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/06/ethereum-layer-2-historical-record-for-the-total-value-locked-tvl-of-21-billion/) (intended as liquidity locked in pools) of the tokens: a low TVL, typically less than a million dollars, highlights a completely unknown coin.

Above one million, while still remaining in an extremely dangerous territory, we could find options that are less risky and at the same time less profitable. Also keep an eye on the TVL/marketcap ratio.

![Image 2](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kPFUAVFXUVRz5Iud8-AQWPNPQvRGd_tpDAiGAcFhVo0U5YBx4AZSlLpzD34qr12vHn8RvxLcBP5SybHSmuXeb2u-RRlkwqBNeM8Ah_HKF7n9LlnUbH1b61QpZdUiPnP7GYdDJB3rXeELBaXS7dBZRD4)

**Other interesting features of the Birdeye trading data aggregator include the ability to place a limit order through the DEX** [**Jupiter**](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/01/03/jupiter-announces-the-airdrop-of-its-token-by-the-end-of-january/) **on the Solana blockchain**, to set alerts, add crypto to the watchlist, and observe the leaderboard of top traders.

The “Coin360” function is also available, which completely replicates the same data visualization work as the “Crypto Bubbles” platform. 

We can specifically monitor the top 100 tokens with the highest volume and price variation in the last 24 hours, across a large number of cryptographic networks.

Birdeye and Debridge: how to farm the crypto airdrop?
-----------------------------------------------------

**Birdeye’s integrated platform also includes a section dedicated to “cross-chain swaps” that significantly helps users move their assets from one chain to another, simplifying essential steps for optimal crypto trading.**

**To meet this need of the community, Birdeye relies on providers Mayan and [Debridge](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/04/13/who-sleeps-doesnt-catch-airdrop-check-eligibility-for-omni-network-and-earn-points-for-the-launch-of-debridge-crypto/) to offer fast and cost-effective asset transfers.**

**

**Using this tool is very simple**: just connect your [web3](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2023/06/03/most-used-dapp-platforms-web3/) wallet, select the reference protocol, indicate the sender and recipient chains, and enter the token data that we want to exchange.

![Image 3](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/taYKTfIB8p2Ixu0siVYUXXEZtBoIH_kGMdmOQv-iixhf5YJjAWhWN_U3Sw50kNi6qqqyu9RJeYA3r7luBMYEiSSE9FMiTbVvybSnTXUzc4GFnexCtwrnu1rmh0P5-DyeYdWgO-ol8FXtybSBjxBqx08)

**As mentioned in the introduction, using this Birdeye function could help us become eligible for the crypto airdrop of the two platforms Debridge and Mayan**.

The first one has already announced the start of an incentive campaign for [points](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/03/27/the-rise-of-airdrop-points-in-new-cryptographic-projects-the-background-of-an-ambiguous-incentive-practice/), which will last for another two months: to obtain rewards of the next governance token of the platform, it is sufficient to use the bridge as many times as possible, preferably spanning across multiple coins and chains, aiming to generate the highest score possible.

**On Debridge it is advisable not to exchange more than 0.001 ETH per transfer if we are operating exclusively for the purpose of the airdrop**, as it is the most effective method to spend less in terms of [slippage](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2023/05/28/what-ethereum-mev-bots/) and earn the highest base score.

Attention because each transaction has a base fee of 4.2 dollars: the airdrop should still cover at least the expenses.

**For Mayan the speech is more complex because at the moment no airdrop campaign has been announced** even if using the protocol has served to be eligible for the [Wormhole](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/03/07/wormhole-supported-by-coinbase-launches-617-million-tokens-a-breakthrough-for-crypto-users/) airdrop.

However, the platform does not yet have a governance token and after the recent $3 million funding co-led by 6MV and Borderless Capital and supported by VCs such as Solana Ventures, Arrington Capital, and Hash3.

To qualify for the potential airdrop, it is advisable to simply use the bridge as many times as possible in different months.

&gt; 1/ 🎉 Big things ahead! We announce today our funding round, co-led by 6MV and Borderless Capital, with support from industry leaders Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana, Saeed Badreg of Wormhole, and more.

*   Bitcoin fell in line with the wider crypto market, with ether and other altcoins also declining.

*   Financial markets have been dogged by risk-off sentiment in the run-up to the Fed's interest-rate decision and press conference later today.


Bitcoin [(BTC)](https://coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"BitcoinPrice|BTCPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") sank below $58,000 during the European morning on Wednesday to the lowest level since the end of February as the world's largest cryptocurrency recorded its worst month since November 2022.

BTC has fallen almost 9% in the last 24 hours having dropped below the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday. The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index ([CD20](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/cd20/)), has lost more than 8.5%.

Cryptocurrencies have been dogged by risk-off sentiment in the broader financial markets amid a stagflationary feel in the U.S. following indications of slower growth and sticky inflation that have tapered hopes of an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee is due to give its latest rate decision later today.

Ether [(ETH)](https://coindesk.com/price/ethereum/"EthereumPrice|ETHPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") also slipped some 9% while some of the other major altcoins, such as solana [(SOL)](https://coindesk.com/price/solana/"SolanaPrice|SOLPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk"), dogecoin [(DOGE)](https://coindesk.com/price/dogecoin/"DogecoinPrice|DOGEPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") and avalanche [(AVAX)](https://coindesk.com/price/avax/"AvalanchePrice|AVAXPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") registered losses in excess of 10%.

Bitcoin fell in April, returning its first monthly loss since August. The 16% decline was the worst since November 2022, when crypto exchange FTX imploded.

In a recent [thread](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1785454318633758868) on X (formerly Twitter), renowned on-chain analyst Checkmate provided an analysis regarding the future trajectory of Bitcoin. Currently, the premier cryptocurrency hovers around the $60,000 mark, a pivotal moment that echoes historical patterns within the Bitcoin market cycle.

What Will The Next 6 Months Bring For Bitcoin?
----------------------------------------------

Checkmate argues that Bitcoin is positioned in a “chopsolidation” phase—a term coined to describe a stagnant yet volatile period. He suggests that this could last approximately six months, based on previous cycles, and potentially usher in a period of parabolic growth that could last between six to twelve months. “Bitcoin [history tends to rhyme](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/why-march-is-the-bloodiest-month-in-bitcoin-history/), and thus far, this cycle is no different,” Checkmate noted. “The song sung during the last two cycles paints around 6-months of chopsolidation ahead of us, followed by 6-12 months of parabolic advance.”

Supporting his analysis, Checkmate refers to April 2021 as a significant high point for Bitcoin for “many good reasons,” noting that despite a considerable monthly drop of over $8,250 in April, such movements are typical and often signify healthy market corrections. “It’s an -11.2% monthly pullback, and is extremely common during uptrends, and corrections are healthy and necessary,” he stated, reinforcing his confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for recovery.

Further statistical backing comes from historical data focused exclusively on [Bitcoin halving](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/) years (2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024), which Checkmate used to illustrate that such month-over-month corrections are not outliers but rather common occurrences within the digital asset’s [cyclical trends](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/where-are-we-in-this-bitcoin-cycle/). The end of each year post-halving has historically shown strong performance, supporting the notion that the current price point could be a precursor to significant gains.

### Sell In May And Go Away?

Checkmate also retweeted a post from Charles Edwards. The founder of Capriole Investments [commented](https://twitter.com/caprioleio) on the market’s unprecedented bullishness, implying that a deeper correction is to be expected.

“This is starting to get ridiculous. Bitcoin has not had a run like this since inception. We are now 1 day short of the record set in 2011 for days without a meaningful dip \[more than 25%\]. If you are not prepared to accept some downside in this asset class, you shouldn’t be here. Especially now,” said Edwards. His remark highlights the unusual lack of severe downturns in the market, suggesting that investors should be prepared for potential volatility. [![Image 6: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374569&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293218&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714552706847253&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fif-history-rhymes-bitcoin-price-next-6-months%2F&amp;hc=664b795d24bf07ad11102d34563368c5acc35655&amp;location=)

In another post on X, Edwards added a cautious note to the otherwise optimistic outlook. He advised, “Sell in May and go away. This looks like distribution to me. As long as we trade below $61.5K, scenario (1) is technically more likely. A strong reclaim of $61.5K would give some hopes to the bulls for scenario (2). A flush would also be good for the sustaining continuation of the bull market, the sooner we get one, the better the long opportunities are.”

This perspective suggests a strategic withdrawal may be wise in the short term, implying that current market conditions might be more bearish than they appear and that a significant correction could potentially strengthen the market’s long-term prospects.

At press time, the BTC plunged to $57,691.

EigenLayer — the largest Ethereum restaking protocol — has received over 12,412 withdrawal requests following widespread disappointment surrounding its planned EIGEN airdrop.

Mass withdrawal requests started on April 29, when EigenLayer saw over 4,336 daily withdrawals, rising to 6,496 on April 30, [according](https://dune.com/queries/3636372/6124104) to Dune data.

The restaking protocol amassed over 12,412 withdrawals in the past three days, which started on April 29 after EigenLayer [released a white paper](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eigenlayer-eigen-whitepaper-bans-airdrop-us-users) on its EIGEN token. However, several jurisdictions were excluded from the airdrop, including the United States, Canada and several African and Asian countries.

EigenLayer has over 107,000 unique depositors, [according](https://dune.com/queries/3592801/6052719) to Dune. In the past three days, the 12,412 withdrawals suggest that 11.6% of unique depositors have withdrawn from the protocol.

While the size of the individual withdrawals can’t yet be traced, the 11.6% of queued withdrawals would reduce EigenLayer’s current $14.8 billion total value locked (TVL) to just above $13 billion.

Since EigenLayer has a seven-day withdrawal processing period, the effects of the mass withdrawals will only become visible in the following weeks.

The ban of key economic jurisdictions from the EigenLayer airdrop has caused widespread disappointment that will affect the protocol’s TVL, according to Anndy Lian, intergovernmental blockchain expert and author of _NFT: From Zero to Hero_. He told Cointelegraph:

&gt; “Participants from these regions might have contributed significantly to EigenLayer’s TVL. Their exclusion could lead to a decrease in the overall TVL, especially if they were actively restaking their assets.”

Airdrop farmers are searching for new restaking protocols
---------------------------------------------------------

EigenLayer’s TVL fell over 4% during the past week, while Karak’s TVL rose 20.5% to $439 million, making it the second-biggest restaking protocol on Ethereum, [according](https://defillama.com/protocols/Restaking) to DefiLlama.

The new restaking protocol’s rapid growth led to speculation that Karak has a “good chance” of [becoming the next EigenLayer](https://cointelegraph.com/news/karak-good-chance-becoming-next-eigenlayer), following the EIGEN airdrop debacle.

Beyond the disappointing airdrop, Karak also introduces technical benefits to users while offering more flexible restaking tokens, according to Lian:

&gt; “Karak introduces unique technical features such as multi-asset restaking and a plug-and-play development environment. These could provide Karak with an edge in attracting developers and users seeking a more versatile restaking platform.”
