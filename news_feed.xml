Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.

Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
----------------------------------------------------------------

It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.

The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.

The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.

This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.

The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.

Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.

They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

URL Source: https://www.bankless.com/economic-wobbles-hit-crypto-hard

Markdown Content:
**Macro Mania.** Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. _Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?_

Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.

Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have [gotten bullish](https://x.com/blknoiz06/status/1785718067554648365?ref=bankless.ghost.io) on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.

Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.

BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…

Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!

Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.

In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after [inventory levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/crude-oil-prices-today.html?ref=bankless.ghost.io) exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.

Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.

While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, [decreasing](https://x.com/FedGuy12/status/1785732034012274930?ref=bankless.ghost.io) the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.

The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.

Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

Markdown Content:
April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.

Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:

1.  Optimism (OP) – 541
2.  Hedera (HBAR) – 459
3.  Cardano (ADA) – 432
4.  Chainlink (LINK) – 397
5.  Polkadot (DOT) – 390
6.  Ethereum (ETH) – 323
7.  Cosmos (ATOM) – 301
8.  Internet Computer (ICP) – 295
9.  MultiversX (EGLD) – 247
10.  Aptos (APT) – 228

It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.

This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

Nearly 14,000 wallets have triggered withdrawals from the Ethereum restaking protocol since April 29.

DeFi traders are leaving EigenLayer in droves since the much-hyped Ethereum restaking protocol released its [airdrop allocations](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-to-drop-token-on-may-10) two days ago.

Since April 29, almost 14,000 wallets have initiated withdrawals from the protocol, accounting for roughly 13% of its [user base](https://dune.com/queries/3592801/6052719).

[![Image 1: EigenLayer Withdrawals](https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F6oftkxoa%2Fproduction%2F89fc72120222b4347fe602224329ca96fc604d07-1600x519.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=100)

EigenLayer Withdrawals

](https://dune.com/queries/3636372/6124105)

EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/). It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).

Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune [dashboard](https://dune.com/hahahash/eigenlayer). That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.

![Image 2: Daily LST Withdrawals](https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F6oftkxoa%2Fproduction%2F129620f5d085778c5781c749a53c773b8f45ebad-1086x435.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=100)

Daily LST Withdrawals

The project is facing [severe backlash](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigen-airdrop-elicits-pushback-from-eigenlayer-community) from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.

Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens. Many community members also criticized the linear distribution of EIGEN, which favours larger depositors.

**Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-explainer/)) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows.** 

With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.

The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
------------------------------------

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 

This indicator is vital for [SHIB’s short-term trajectory](https://beincrypto.com/shib-continues-price-correction-whats-next/), serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.

Conversely, [SHIB has some potential bullish signals](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-trigger-rally-for-shib/) on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move.

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025.

Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.

As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.

As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time.

However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here?
---------------------------

In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to [plunge](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analysts-bullish-on-bitcoin-despite-peter-schiffs-20000-doom-scenario/) from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392605&amp;setID=366606&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311165&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714603289197913&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fbitcoin-news%2Fis-this-cycles-bitcoin-bottom-in-analysts-forecast-btc-bounce-back%2F&amp;hc=c0257157e268bfe2595a72af875dd1dd7a179353&amp;location=)

This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull [examined](https://twitter.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1785617072296206825) some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in.

According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom.

In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the [flagship cryptocurrency](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-odds-in-bitcoin-bulls-favor-these-analysts-forecast-btcs-future/) might “wick through the support and bounce back.”

According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023.

Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top.

Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle
------------------------------------

According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the [post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785661251357487123), today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023.

The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think.

&gt; [#BTC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
&gt; 
&gt; We are here (orange circle)
&gt; 
&gt; And we've seen Post-Halving pullbacks like this in the past (e.g. 2016)[$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#BitcoinHalving](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinHalving?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/OvOcmJTzFk](https://t.co/OvOcmJTzFk)

Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the [resemblances](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-getting-ready-for-an-explosive-breakout-these-analysts-believe-so/) include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.”

After today’s retrace, the analyst [added](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785599091893846428) the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.”

Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.”

As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

![Image 1: Is Binance founder CZ's sentence the boost BNB needed all along?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _BNB tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period owing to broader market bloodbath._
*   _The positive commentary around the coin increased dramatically in the last 24–48 hours._

[Binance Coin \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) suffered substantial losses in the last 24 hours, as the broader market downturn took its toll on the native token of the Binance ecosystem.

The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period, data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/) showed.

However, on a monthly time frame, the coin performed comparatively better against other leading coins, nursing losses of just 6%.

That being said, BNB could be in for healthy gains in the short to medium term, as a major chapter, which fueled considerable FUD for the coin in the recent past, reached a conclusion.

#### A short-term bullish catalyst?

Binance’s ex-boss, Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, was [sentenced](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-billionaire-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/) to four months in prison, for the charges brought against him by the U.S. government.

The charges were severe, including violation of anti-money-laundering rules that allowed illicit transactions on the exchange.

The news of the announcement set the social circles buzzing. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the mention of BNB on top crypto-focused social channels surged dramatically.

Interestingly, positive commentary around the coin exceeded bearish takes, as weighted sentiment entered the positive territory. This suggested a more favorable view of BNB’s next moves by the market.

#### Futures traders not hopeful of quick rebound

BNB’s sentiment in the derivatives market continued to be bearish.

The number of traders shorting the crypto increased considerably in the last 24 hours, AMBCrypto spotted using Coinglass’ Long/Shorts Ratio indicator.

The [Open Interest (OI)](https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest), or the money invested in active futures contracts of BNB, dropped 1.27% in the last 24 hours to $564 million.

While this might be due to the broader market downturn, BNB could see investments trickling in once the sentiment improves.

Markdown Content:
Cathie Wood, one of the most famous investors, revised her previous Bitcoin price prediction of $ 1.5 million.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is known for her bold predictions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Despite the skepticism surrounding these predictions, they continue to attract the attention of investors and analysts alike.

At an investor day in New York, Wood made a surprising prediction. According to Wood, Bitcoin price could rise to a staggering $3.8 million by 2030.

In his own words, Wood expressed his prediction as follows:

&gt; “Last year, we put forward our bullish scenario for Bitcoin. This figure was $1.5 million. With the institutional green light provided by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), albeit difficult, according to our analysis, institutional investors invested a little more than 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. “If they do, and we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the estimate I gave you.”

Wood's prediction is based on the assumption that institutional investors will start investing heavily in Bitcoin. If Wood's prediction proves correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million by 2030, a modest investment of $1,000 today could potentially rise to over $60,000. However, there are also many analysts who are skeptical of Wood's prediction, considering it only has 5.5 years to come true.

Despite the [current market downtrend](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-3-metrics-solid-healthy-bull-market/), crypto traders are still finding ways to make life-changing gains. This is the case of some [Solana meme coin traders](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/) who recently turned $6,400 into $8 million in 24 hours. 

[On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain](https://bitcoinist.com/tron-founder-justin-sun-gets-new-wallet-heres-what-hes-buying/) revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a [meme coin on Solana](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/). 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.

These wallets then transferred their $TIM holdings (now worth around $8.28 million) to multiple addresses to avoid drawing attention. On-chain data shows that they are already looking to secure their profits, as they have been selling their $TIM tokens, although in small bits, to avoid a market crash.

Meme coins (especially ones on Solana) have continued to provide traders with significant gains, especially with Bitcoin and other major cap cryptocurrencies maintaining a downward trend. Bitcoinist [previously reported](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/) of a trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million with Dogwifhat (WIF) by getting in early on the meme coin while it was still a micro-cap token. 

Meanwhile, more recently, pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier was [reported](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-100-8-3-million-ethereum/) to have turned $353 into $8.3 million by investing in $KEYCAT, a [meme coin on Base](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/). The layer-2 network (like Solana) has witnessed an influx of meme coin traders thanks to the barrage of meme coins that continue to launch on the network daily.

More Recent Success Stories
---------------------------

Lookonchain also recently revealed a trader who turned [$9,770 into $10 million](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-1-6-million-bsc-meme-coin/) in just a day. The trader spent 64.5 SOL to [buy](https://t.co/GTaRgN09X7) 97.36 million $GUMMY (another [Solana-based meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/bonk-bullish-massive-burn/)) in the “same block where the $GUMMY deployer added liquidity.” Another trader [turned](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1782467836969205889) $110,000 into 48.72 million in just 3 hours by buying $MANEKI.

Although this trader wasn’t the first to buy the [meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-market-cap-100-billion-bull-cycle/), he used $716 SOL to acquire 1.02 billion $MANEKI (11.51% of the token’s supply) less than one minute after the token launched. Like the $TIM traders, he distributed these $MANEKI tokens across different wallets to avoid drawing attention. 

Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there is an ugly side to [meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/pepe-flip-dogecoin-shiba-inu/) trading, as some traders have also recorded significant losses. One is a trader who [recently](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1784804956073291842) spent 1,600 SOL to buy $COOL and ended up [selling](https://t.co/YSbJWfPzAJ) the meme coin for 532.58 SOL, losing 1,067.42 ($152,000) in the process.

Oregon has become the sixth state to revoke, suspend or decline to renew Binance.US’ license to operate there, following a spate of refusals earlier this year. 

The Oregon Division of Financial Regulation announced on April 30 that it had revoked Binance.US’s license, as a result of which it is prohibited from accepting money for transmission or holding or selling fiat or crypto for Oregon consumers. The division [explained](https://dfr.oregon.gov/news/news2024/Pages/20240430-Binance-Revocation.aspx) in a statement:

&gt; “Due to the nature of the felonies committed by \[former Binance CEO Changpeng\] Zhao, the Division has revoked Binance.US's money transmission license.” Oregon was following the example of five states that moved against the exchange after Zhao pleaded guilty to violating Anti-Money Laundering laws. Florida [was the first state to act](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-banned-florida-alaska), suspending Binance.US’ license in November, shortly after Zhao’s guilty plea. Alaska followed suit at the beginning of January when it declined to renew its license.

North Carolina [suspended](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/Artifact/Other.pdf?q=303764-394428) Binance.US’ license on January 23, and Maine [declined](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/Artifact/Other.pdf?q=303753-394417) to renew its license on January 29. According to a local press report, Connecticut [suspended](https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/ct-seeks-to-block-crypto-exchange-binance-from-operating-in-state-founder-sentenced-to) Binance.US’ license on April 24.

Binance.US never received licenses in New York, Texas, Vermont and Hawaii.

According to one page on the Binance.US website, its services are [unavailable](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360046786914-List-of-Unsupported-States) in Georgia and Ohio as well, although another page indicates that the exchange [has](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050532193-Licenses) licenses there. Binance [opened](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/binance-opens-a-regional-hub-in-georgia-8854914046327976377) a regional hub in Georgia with a staff of 25 in March 2023. Its license in Minnesota does not cover the exchange or transmission of virtual currency.

That is not the full extent of Binance.US’ troubles. Binance.US chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett [said in a court deposition](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-sec-lawsuit-choking-business-layoff-revenue) in December that the exchange had taken a “near-mortal blow,” forcing it to lay off over 200 staff members, due to U.S. banks’ unwillingness to work with it.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [sued Binance in June](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations). In that suit, the SEC claimed that Binance.US had failed to register as an exchange, broker and clearing agency. It further alleged that Binance.US lacked controls over “manipulative trading,” engaged in wash trading and had commingled funds with Binance, which created Binance.US in 2019 under regulatory pressure.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) price dropped 5.42% over the last 24 hours to hit a new multi-week low at $57,151 on May 1. On-chain data shows that a slowdown in Bitcoin demand growth and increased open short positions may be responsible for the latest drawdown, and it’s possible that new lows will be in store for BTC.

Reporting from CryptoQuant attributes [BTC’s latest decline](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today) to a slowdown in demand characterized by decreased growth in Bitcoin balances among permanent holders, [slowing spot Bitcoin ETF demand](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-demand-negative-btc-halving#:~:text=Demand%20for%20the%20newest%20Bitcoin,after%20launching%20in%20January%202024.) and an increase in short positions in the futures market.

CryptoQuant data shows that demand from permanent holders (investors who only purchase Bitcoin and never sell) fell by 50% in April, from over 200,000 BTC in late March to about 90,000 BTC.

&gt; “Accelerating demand growth is needed for prices to bottom and eventually rally significantly.”

The chart above reveals that this metric has “reached levels similar to early March when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,” dropping 7% immediately after breaching its all-time highs.

[Demand from whales](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-accumulation-phase-btc-halving-week-away) has been declining since late March,, and according to CryptoQuant analysts, BTC price corrections are usually driven by slower growth in demand from large investors.

&gt; “Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”

The analysts also said that the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was evinced by declining purchases from spot ETFs in the U.S., which also added to the sell-side pressure.

“The daily purchase of Bitcoin from ETFs has plummeted to basically zero currently, after peaking in mid-March at more than $1 billion,” noted the report, adding that "a new wave of Bitcoin purchases from ETFs is needed to refresh demand growth.”

Another metric that the on-chain data analytics firm used to explain the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was the “traders’ unwillingness to pay more to open long positions” as sell orders outpace buy orders.

Bitcoin’s funding rate has dropped to a year-to-date low, indicating traders’ unwillingness to “pay as much as before to open long positions.”

Instead, “the recent price decline has been caused by traders opening short positions, expecting prices to decline further,” the report noted.

Analysts agree that downside is the likely direction for Bitcoin price
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ongoing [market correction](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today) has left market participants wondering [how low Bitcoin price can go](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go) before a trend reversal occurs.

CryptoQuant analysts set the lower target within the $55,000 to $57,000 demand zone, which is “10% below the current cost basis of traders of $63,000.” Traders’ cost basis has been known to offer support for prices during bull markets.

&gt; “The current Bitcoin price is already below traders’ cost basis.”

For popular analyst Scott Melker, $52,000 is as low as the BTC price can go in the short term. Melker [said](https://x.com/scottmelker/status/1785596055125434827) the correction is still mild for a bull market since the daily RSI is not yet oversold.

&gt; “This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”

Continuing, Tuur Demeester, a Bitcoin analyst, spotted BTC trading at $60,409, [saying](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1785435223687049378) $50,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin now that the $60,000 support was lost.

_Source:_ [_Tuur Demeester_](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1785435223687049378)

Trader and analyst Mags [said](https://x.com/thescalpingpro/status/1785573452243775528) that if Bitcoin closes below $60,000 on the weekly timeframe, traders should “expect a much deeper retracement, till $40,000 and even lower.”

&gt; “In this cycle so far, we have seen 4 pullbacks between 20-22%. If we witness something similar, a -22% correction from the local high would put us at $58,000 - $57,500.”

Markdown Content:
Cryptocurrency company **Coinbase Global** COIN will report first-quarter (Q1) financial results after market close on [Thursday, May 2, 2024.](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings)

Read on for earnings estimates, [analyst ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/COIN/analyst-ratings), price targets and the key items to watch:

**Ratings &amp; Targets**:

*   HC Wainwright: Buy rating, raised price target from $250 to $300
*   JPMorgan: Neutral rating, $150 price target
*   Bernstein: Market Perform rating, raised price target from $80 to $200
*   Compass Point: Buy rating, raised price target from $235 to $325
*   Mizuho Securities: Underperform rating, raised price target from $84 to $145
*   Piper Sandler: Neutral rating, raised price target from $225 to $245
*   Bank of America: Underperform rating, raised price target from $92 to $110

**Earnings Estimates:** Analysts expect Coinbase to report first-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, according to [data from Benzinga Pro.](https://www.benzinga.com/pro/feature/newsfeed?gspk=bHVrZWphY29iaTUzNDg&amp;gsxid=tdEE0VrK8Jeg&amp;ref=lukejacobi5348)

The company reported revenue of $772.53 million in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in five straight quarters.

Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.00 for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 34 cents in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last five quarter, including four consecutive quarters.

The company has not guided for revenue estimates but [said previously it expects](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/02/37169863/coinbase-q4-earnings-revenue-beat-surprise-profit-crypto-update-and-more) first-quarter subscription and services revenue to be in a range of $410 million to $480 million.

**What Analysts Say**: The first quarter was an "eventful quarter for the cryptoecosystem," JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said.

The analyst said Coinbase could be a key beneficiary of the increased trading activity.

Worthington expects Coinbase to post subscription and services revenue of $450 million. The analyst also sees Base, which is Coinbase's Layer 2 platform, contributing more meaningful in the quarter at around $20 million in net revenue.

"We see Coinbase as both a leading driver and beneficiary of the cryptocurrency economy, and we previously underestimated the strength of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its early days – launched January 2024 – as a key catalyst for the crypto industry," Worthington said.

The analyst said Coinbase's revenue generation could benefit in the short term with a crypto rally.

"We see the longer term success of Coinbase being driven by development, with our focus on tokenization and payments."

**Key Items to Watch:** When Coinbase reported fourth-quarter financial results, the company said its three main priorities for 2024 would be driving revenue through improving core trading, driving utility in crypto with experiments in payments and driving regulatory clarity for the industry.

Investors and analysts will watch for all of these items in the upcoming quarterly report.

The biggest item likely watched by those looking at Coinbase will be the impact [the approval and launch](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36514679/wall-street-enters-the-crypto-age-sec-issues-historic-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs) of **Bitcoin** BTC/USD ETFs had on the company in the first quarter.

Investors will also be looking to see how big of an impact on trading volume and transaction revenues Bitcoin had compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represented 31% of trading volume and 29% of transaction revenues in the fourth quarter.

The balance of transaction revenue with the company's subscription and services revenue could also be something to monitor. The transaction revenue is larger but can also be more volatile from quarter to quarter, while the subscription and services revenue is growing and also important for the company increasing efforts for profitability.

**COIN Price Action**: Coinbase shares were up 3% to $210.09 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $46.43 to $283.48.

_Wednesday, May 01, 2024_ – An ongoing presale for Solana’s greatest multichain good boy [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) ($DOGEVERSE) has taken in $13 million so far, with at least $2 million flooding into the ICO in the five days since it deployed on Solana.

Crypto’s latest Shiba Inu-inspired funny token has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see Dogeverse’s hyper-jumping cross-chain capabilities as a hint of tomorrow’s meme coin capabilities.

Now SOL fans are in on the action too. As of Friday, April 26, Dogeverse has rolled out on its sixth native chain, Solana, joining a digital economy that is home to [$3.465 billion](https://defillama.com/chain/Solana) in total value locked (TVL), with [1.13 million active users](https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/solana/number-of-active-addresses-on-the-solana-network-daily-7dma) transacting daily and over [2,500 monthly active developers](https://solana.com/news/2023-state-of-solana-developer-ecosystem).

Since Dogeverse exists on multiple chains, it can be purchased by anyone on Ethereum ($ETH), BNB Smart Chain ($BNB), Polygon ($MATIC), Avalanche ($AVAX), Base ($BASE) and now Solana ($SOL) to spare.

To purchase with SOL, simply head to the [website](https://thedogeverse.com/en) and select “Buy With SOL” from the drop-down menu of the buy widget. Doing so will transport users to a Solana-based version of the site hosted on [solana.thedogeverse.com](http://solana.thedogeverse.com/).

The option to pay with Solana is hosted on a subdomain, due to wallet connect functions not being able to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana-integrated wallets in tandem.

The SOL-specific version of the Dogeverse website also adds the ability to buy tokens using Circle’s hugely popular USDC, which is the stablecoin of choice on the Solana network,

The Dogeverse ICO and Beyond
----------------------------


Currently priced at $0.000304 and due to rise in a few days, [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) sold out its initial soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launching at the beginning of April.

A heady $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated to the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.

This enabled [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) to move onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens are being sold to the public across the remaining rounds before the presale closes. Initially, this was planned for June 11, however, due to the immense success of the presale, it’s likely to conclude substantially earlier.

The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used to bolster liquidity to ensure high-volume trading and for buy-back funds.

Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.

The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.

Cosmo: Crypto’s New Hyper-Jumping Multi-Chain Good Boy
------------------------------------------------------


The market’s appetite for canine-themed coins began with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. Dogecoin didn’t need much of a sales pitch, because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)

Since then, many celebrities have professed their love for the novelty canine cryptocurrency, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, American entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg.

But fun as it may be, Dogecoin is not without its problems.

Since Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, it utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions. This means that the miners with the most computation and power mine the most Dogecoin. Like Bitcoin, mining DOGE consumes a lot of energy.

Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but all of them have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

To date, none of the alternative Dogecoins have seriously challenged the original’s dominance.

[Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) hopes to change that. It is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism.

At the center of the [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.

Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.

&gt; 🌟 Introducing [#Cosmo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cosmo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), the remarkable [#Doge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Doge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) born from stardust! 🌠

Dogeverse and the Ethereum ETF Saga
-----------------------------------


Analysts are anticipating potentially price-driving news this month, on May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for US spot Ethereum ETFs.

The date could mark the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.

So will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/).

Given the fact that a federal court overturned the SEC’s earlier refusal of Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious” it’s possible that spot Ethereum ETFs will pass through unopposed, smashing the doors down for the approval of similar products for Solana and Avalanche.

The ETF effect is a very real catalyst, too. Earlier this year, the US launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs rallied the original cryptocurrency to set a new high watermark of $73,737.94 on March 14.

So Cosmo is a clean and green representative of not one, not two, but six different blockchain networks. And with staking capabilities, seamless multi-chain fun and a potentially catalytic news cycle in the coming months, what’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?

Join the presale over on [the Dogeverse website](https://thedogeverse.com/en) before the price rises.

Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – Crypto’s latest cybernetic sausage dog sensation, AI meme coin WienerAI ($WAI), has added the most advanced beginner-friendly trading bot in crypto to its ecosystem in an ICO that has already attracted over $700,000 in three weeks.

The team is touting its new AI companion as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner” with user-friendly AI-enhanced trading, seamless swap functionality and zero fees. With unparalleled capabilities, WienerAI is the ultimate asset for every crypto trader.

It couldn’t be easier to get an edge, thanks to WienerAI. Just ask the bot a question relating to whatever your crypto investment needs are, and WienerAI will use its predictive technology to scour the markets to sniff out a winner for his owners, providing them with a breakdown of his logic and analysis.

![Image 5: winner ai the future of trading](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01205241/1714596761-9d165f859d1fec04f2df2c21ebfb2c3b.jpg)

Wiener’s swap feature allows his users to make fast, efficient token swaps and in a few clicks find the best prices available on DEXs.

It also has a reflexive edge over frontrunners, like MEV bots. These bots frontrun traders’ transactions in order to profit from minimizing their gains. WienerAI’s cybernetic capabilities get him in front of every frontrunner.

WienerAI recalls another successful recent token launch, canine meme coin and AI security token Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY), which netted close to $10 million in a recent presale.

Combining two hot niches, both $WAI and $SCOTTY have inspired investors with the promise of a new generation of coins that offer more laughs than run-of-the-mill AI coins and more utility than bog standard meme coins.

Other strong narratives driving the project are its eye-watering staking rewards, currently offering yields of 1241% per annum, its verified audit, and the fun, community-building storyline.

----------------------------------------


To begin with, investors have probably never heard an origin story like this before. Like his predecessor, Scotty the AI, WienerAI arrives on the scene with a fully-formed backstory.

Wiener was born in a lab in New Silicon Valley, AD 2132. His progenitor is a mad puppy-loving scientist known as The Architect, whose life’s work was to create an advanced AI/canine hybrid.

Indeed, he succeeded, albeit with one caveat. The Architect was eating a sausage as he was performing the splicing procedure. The accidental result was WienerAI, a hybrid of pup, AI and sausage.

Now, the [whitepaper](https://wienerdog.ai/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf) mentions “companionship” and “friendship” as key parts of Wiener’s premise. It also mentions “The Sausage Army”, the endearing term for the legions of followers Wiener hopes to attract, so there are subtle hints at a strong social component.

He’s not the first crypto doge with an army, but he may be the best.

WienerAI Wants To Take Over Crypto’s Doge Scene
-----------------------------------------------


The world’s first and favorite meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), also has an army: the self-styled “Doge Army”, but Wiener is aiming for a wider community and he has a decent battle cry to help him rally his sausage forces.

See, Dogecoin is one tired pupper. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is housed on its own blockchain, which is a spin on Bitcoin’s. Dogecoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which means that it’s the miners with access to the most power and/or computation that bag the most DOGE.

In a world of rising atmospheric temperatures and international climate targets, PoW is a growing concern among more conscientious investors.

WienerAI’s native chain, Ethereum, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where the miners that stake the most ETH get the most rewards. This is well over 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

Secondly, in an industry that was rocked by near-constant scandals and liquidity crises in the last two years, WienerAI offers the security of proper auditing. The WienerAI smart contract was [audited by Coinsult](https://coinsult.net/projects/wiener-ai/), a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. This gives investors added confidence in WienerAI.

Lastly, there’s the daily staking rewards. Some 20% of $WAI’s supply is earmarked for staking. Buyers can stake during the presale, and are in fact [encouraged](https://wienerdog.ai/en#howto) to do so on the website, in order to take advantage of the lucrative 1241% APY on offer at present.

Mysterious he may be, but it’s no mystery why investors are piling into WienerAI’s new presale. Everybody wants to get their hands on a tokenized piece of crypto’s most advanced beginner-friendly AI trading companion yet.

Bitcoin Traders Target Test of $53,000 Support as BTC Price Predictions Remains Bearish Following Fed Meeting

The Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating in the mid-$57,000s, down roughly 5% on the day, though up around 1.5% or $1,000 from earlier session lows as traders weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts this year in wake of the latest policy announcement from the US central bank.

As anticipated, the [Fed left interest rates](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-hold-rates-steady-inflation-dims-hopes-policy-easing-2024-05-01/) at multi-decade high levels of 5.25-5.5% and [slowed its balance sheet run-off](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-announces-reduction-balance-sheet-runoff-pace-2024-05-01/).

The central bank will now allow its portfolio of assets to shrink by only $25 billion per month. Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.

That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate. That could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.

At current levels, [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/) is trading hands roughly in line with where it was prior to the Fed’s announcement.

As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.

&gt; POWELL: INFLATION DATA RECEIVED THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED

Gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than though, he commented.

&gt; POWELL: GAINING CONFIDENCE TO CUT WILL TAKE LONGER THAN THOUGHT
&gt; 
&gt; — \*Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1785740392807240164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago, as per [CME data](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).

Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.

Net-net, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.

**Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?**
-------------------------------------


While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside incoming.

Prior to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.

That drop came after fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.

The drop from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures, and as ETF outflows accelerate.

As per data presented by [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/bitcoin-etf/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows), US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five straight days.

![Image 6: The Bitcoin price's drop from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures, and as ETF outflows accelerate.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01221354/1714601634-screenshot-2024-05-01-171258.png)

Importantly, Wednesday’s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.

The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.

A chorus of analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s, including at Standard Chartered.

&gt; Bitcoin will drop 13% to $50,000 after falling below a key support level as macro drivers slow, Standard Chartered says  
&gt; Bitcoin has fallen past the ETF purchase price of around $58,000, putting over half of ETF positions underwater, Standard Chartered wrote.

A few analysts mentioned the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 as important to watch.

“There might have been lots of ‘TradeFi’ tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving”, 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.  “This time is now over”.

“We expect more unwinding as… Bitcoin trades below $57,300”, he continued.

“This will likely lower prices to… a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top”.

That explains “our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks”, he concluded.

*   **The SEC may be set to approve leveraged ETH futures ETFs.**
*   **The likely approval comes despite an ongoing investigation into whether Ethereum is an unregistered security.**
*   **At the same time, the SEC continues to delay a decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.**

[The debacle](https://dailycoin.com/sec-reignites-ethereum-debate-yet-again-security-or-not/) over the SEC’s classification of [Ethereum](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-ethereum-blockchains-future-of-finance-explained/) is getting more complicated.

Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the regulator has the second largest crypto asset in terms of market cap in its cross-hairs, suspecting that the asset may be an unregistered security. For the observers, the situation recently got more complicated as [a recent ConsenSys complaint revealed](https://dailycoin.com/how-year-long-eth-security-probe-paints-sec-into-a-corner/) that the SEC’s Ethereum probe has been on for at least a year, months before the agency implicitly signed off on the CFTC’s classification of ETH as a commodity by approving ETH futures ETFs.

Adding to the growing confusion over the SEC’s stance, the agency now looks set to approve leveraged ETH ETF products.

Leveraged ETH Futures ETF Applicants Feeling “Optimistic”
---------------------------------------------------------

On Wednesday, May 1, _Fox Business_ journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that leveraged ETH futures ETF applicants felt “optimistic” about their chances of getting approval, citing persons familiar with the matter. The journalist disclosed that these institutions expressed this view based on “positive dialogue” from the SEC. 

&gt; 🚨SCOOP: Some issuers that have filed with the [@SECGov](https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for leveraged [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) futures ETFs describe “positive dialogue” with SEC staff over applications, one telling me they feel “optimistic” the agency will let the funds go into effect based on the engagement thus far.

If the SEC gives the green light as they expect, Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) will be the first to go live on June 4.  As Terrett highlighted, approving these products will add another layer of intrigue to the Ethereum security status debacle.

By approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs, the SEC will be stirring further confusion by again implicitly accepting the CFTC’s classification of the crypto asset while having a pending investigation into whether it is a security.

Stressing the potential implications of the move, Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnsson asserted that the SEC’s decision on the matter would be “key to watch.”

&gt; This is key to watch. Beyond this, we know the SEC has historically requested voluntary withdrawals on similar ETH products within about a week of filing (when they don't want them to go effective). It's now been over 3 weeks for these. [https://t.co/QLM7vnNQUW](https://t.co/QLM7vnNQUW)
&gt; 
&gt; — Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1785675887163105287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Beyond the apparent inconsistencies in the regulator’s actions, from a risk perspective, most could not wrap their head around the logic of approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs while delaying spot ETFs.

“Make It Make Sense”
--------------------

For months, [the SEC has delayed](https://dailycoin.com/eth-etf-wait-continues-as-sec-delays-decision-on-two-filings/) its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, offering no reason for the delay except that it required more time to review applications. With the May 23 deadline for the agency to decide on VanEck’s application looming, the growing consensus among observers and even some applicants is that this application will be denied.

The possibility of the SEC first approving leveraged futures ETFs, which arguably pose greater investment risks over spot offerings, has rubbed many off as odd, to say the least.

Angel Investor Eric Conner sarcastically quipped, “Make so much sense… Much protection!”

Chiming in, The ETF Store, Inc. President Nate Geraci [added](https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1785461956138127870?t=xflxScFKTJnyUR4K8FOtWA&amp;s=19), “Somebody make it make sense.”

On the Flipside 
----------------

*   **The SEC has yet to approve the leveraged ETH futures ETFs officially.**
*   **It will not be the first time the SEC approved leveraged futures ETFs before the spot. The agency had approved leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs about six months before finally approving the spot product.**

Why This Matters
----------------

The likely approval of leveraged ETH futures ETFs adds further confusion to the uncertainty surrounding the agency’s classification of Ethereum.

[Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/these-altcoins-are-set-to-inject-billions-into-the-crypto/) following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment.

Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash
-----------------------------

In an analysis [posted](https://x.com/intocryptoverse/status/1785310389976043682) on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his [expectations for altcoins](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-altcoins-parabolic-curve/). According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come.

Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow.

![Image 1](https://servedbyadbutler.com/error/blank.gif)

[![Image 2: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112492)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368655&amp;setID=366606&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697925&amp;banID=521829427&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287437&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714606414330692&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Faltcoin%2Faltcoins-in-trouble-40-drop%2F&amp;hc=b1848a9801a825a1638b229c905d5740b5c86973&amp;location=)

The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said.

Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated.

If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The [altcoin market cap](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-opportunity-zone-santiment-reveals/) has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion.

Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market
--------------------------------------

While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the [impact on altcoins](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/are-altcoins-cooling-off-analyst-weighs-in-on-this-cycles-market/) has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader [Dogecoin](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-traders-og-dogecoin-altcoins/) dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and [Shiba Inu](https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-surprise-binance-japan-listing-ignites-360-price-spike/) fell 4.18%.

Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with [Optimism (OP)](https://www.newsbtc.com/optimism-2/optimism-soars-by-17-despite-recent-security-revelations/) recording 12% gains.

Despite the 7% pullback, Bitcoin, Base, and Blast managed to capture more interest from DeFi users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total value locked (TVL) on decentralized applications fell $10 billion in April, [according](https://defillama.com/?liquidstaking=true) to data aggregator DefiLlama. That’s a 7% drop in 30 days, as the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem closed last month with $138.6 billion, including liquid staked amounts.

![Image 1: DeFi’s total value locked falls $10 billion in April](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201809%20311'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

DeFi’s TVL variation in April. Image: DefiLlama

Considering the 10 largest blockchains by TVL, Avalanche registered the most significant monthly drop, with 31.5% of the funds leaving the chain. Solana also saw a considerable amount of crypto leaving its ecosystem as its TVL slump was almost 30%.

Nevertheless, the over $6 billion locked in its applications makes Solana the third-largest blockchain in total value locked. Meanwhile, despite the 14.2% drop, Ethereum still dominates almost 69% of DeFi’s TVL.

Despite the outflow of locked funds seen in the decentralized ecosystem, Base and Bitcoin managed to attract more capital and surpass the $1 billion threshold. The Layer-2 blockchain created by crypto exchange Coinbase presented an 18.4% growth, led by Moonwell, Seamless Protocol, and Tarot applications.

Bitcoin was propelled by new L2 infrastructure, which boosted its TVL by almost 39% in a month. Moreover, the Bitcoin DeFi narrative is hyped by industry players, such as services provider Trust Machines. Mark Hendrickson, a member of Trust Machines’ team, shared with Crypto Briefing that Bitcoin has as many functionalities as other blockchains, and events such as Stacks’ Nakamoto upgrade will boost the DeFi narrative.

Blast, another layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum, showed a slight growth of 4.4% in April and closed the group of winners for the past 30 days.

**Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.**

Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.

However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.

In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

**How to Buy Solana Memecoins**
-------------------------------

Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.

Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like [Raydium](https://beta.raydium.io/swap/) or [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-USDC).

This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-link-another-price-drop/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T22:00:00+00:00

Markdown Content:
**[Chainlink](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-chainlink/) (LINK) is currently facing bearish woes and could react to them by noting a price drop. This is essential for the altcoin to initiate a recovery that could help gain the losses noted recently.**

Investors are exhibiting short-term pessimism, which aligns with the predicted outcome for the LINK price.

Chainlink Investors Could Make a Move Soon
------------------------------------------

LINK price is anticipating a decline, and the network is not keen on changing the outcome. The recent correction eliminated any incentive for new investors to [jump aboard the Chainlink train](https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-ccip-expands-nine-blockchain/). This is evident in the network growth, which has dipped to a yearly low.

Network growth is calculated based on the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network. This data determines whether or not a project is losing traction in the market.

Given [Chainlink’s network growth](https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/) is so low, it seems probable that LINK is not attracting any new users at the moment. This could negatively impact the price of the token.

Secondly, LINK is highly undervalued at the moment, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This, however, is a bullish development. 

The MVRV ratio measures investor profit/loss. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV at -16% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation.

Historically, LINK price recovery occurs at -7% and -17% MVRV, labeling it an opportunity zone. Nevertheless, there is still some room before LINK investors purchase the token right now to initiate a recovery.

LINK Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch
------------------------------------------

LINK price, trading at $12.7 at the time of writing, is below the support of $13.2. This is a crucial level because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement.

Further [decline is likely should LINK fall below](https://beincrypto.com/link-price-breach-bearish-pattern/) the support at $12.7. Considering the market conditions, LINK will potentially drop to $11.7 before bouncing back up.

However, if the support at $12.7 remains intact and Chainlink reclaims 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement as support, [it could initiate a recovery](https://beincrypto.com/link-primed-for-recovery-next/). This would invalidate the bearish thesis and enable a rise to $14.8 and beyond.

The foremost meme coin, [Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-sell-off-10-billion-doge/), has entered a major accumulation zone, suggesting that this may be the right time to invest in the crypto token. This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a [trend reversal](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-major-support-doge/) from the current downtrend that it is experiencing. 

Dogecoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Is A Buy Signal

This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued.

Besides new investors, Dogecoin’s current holders are also expected to use this opportunity to [accumulate](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-meme-coins/) more of the meme coin in a bid to break even in their positions. This already looks to be happening, as [data](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/DOGE/quick-view) from IntoTheBlock shows a notable increase in the token supply held by long-term holders (more than a year).

Crypto investors buying up the Dogecoin dip can add significant buying pressure to the crypto token, which could spark a price recovery amidst this market downtrend. Moreover, on-chain data shows that [Dogecoin whales](https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-buying-dogecoin/) are also accumulating during this period. Specifically, 150,000,000 DOGE were [transferred](https://whale-alert.io/transaction/dogecoin/0c9144521d83aa293a208a424b6bea96841cbac2b8697bbae55812109fb73154) from the [crypto trading platform Robinhood](https://bitcoinist.com/robinhood-shiba-inu-shib/) to an unknown wallet, while another 76,316,694 DOGE were [transferred](https://whale-alert.io/transaction/dogecoin/73cf55305afeb2d3861d931acdcc3fc6ee4b8a0f7e353327cc980432b1e5917e) from Robinhood to that wallet. 

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368621&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287403&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714613671589420&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fdogecoin-accumulation-zone%2F&amp;hc=1beba0b0c673581fe1fb4fd6225416a4eaf4bb09&amp;location=)

These whales have a massive influence on the market, and their buys could positively impact DOGE’s price. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that this price recovery looks imminent for DOGE, considering that recovery has historically always occurred around this MVRV range. 

What DOGE Chart Is Saying
-------------------------

[Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi)](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-says-dogecoin-could-rally-2500-presents-possible-targets/) recently [stated](https://x.com/Kev_Capital_TA/status/1785437140773695576) that Dogecoin is currently at a “major support zone, one which he believes that the meme coin shouldn’t lose if the crypto market is indeed in a “real bull market.” The analyst mentioned in an earlier X (formerly Twitter) [post](https://x.com/Kev_Capital_TA/status/1784731797529534466) that Dogecoin needs to hold above this level to remain bullish.

However, [Dogecoin](https://bitcoinist.com/can-dogecoin-reach-0-2/) risks dropping below that level, especially with the current market-wide downtrend with Bitcoin leading the charge. Moreover, [Fed Chair Jerome Powell](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-takes-a-hit-as-fed-puts-rate-cuts-on-hold/) is set to announce the rate decision on May 1, which could cause DOGE and other crypto tokens to decline further if they decide to take a [hawkish stance](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-fomc-meeting-most-important-in-years/) and increase interest rates.

During a presentation at the annual [MicroStrategy World](https://www.microstrategy.com/world-2024/bitcoin-for-corporations) conference in Las Vegas, MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor unveiled the open-source MicroStrategy Orange Decentralized Identity protocol.

“Michael presented a very compelling case for why we need decentralized identity and did decentralized identifiers,” MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering Cezary Raczko told the audience. “He made an even more compelling case why it makes sense to anchor digital identity into the Bitcoin blockchain, protected by the strength and the security of the Bitcoin network.”

Alongside the announcement, MicroStrategy published an unofficial draft of the MicroStrategy Orange specification to [Github](https://microstrategy.github.io/did-btc-spec/).

While the timing of the news was unexpected, Saylor [previously hinted](https://decrypt.co/140670/microstrategy-looking-at-bitcoin-ordinals-for-app-development-says-michael-saylor) that his company was working in the identity and authentication space. He told _Decrypt_ last year that MicroStrategy was more than aware of Ordinals after the protocol launched in January, and interested in exploring how it could inspire software innovations.

[MicroStrategy Looking at Bitcoin Ordinals for App Development, Says Michael Saylor](https://decrypt.co/140670/microstrategy-looking-at-bitcoin-ordinals-for-app-development-says-michael-saylor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said the company isn’t just aware of Ordinals, it’s interested in how the protocol that’s set Bitcoin’s community abuzz could lead to software innovation. In an interview at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Saylor exclusively told Decrypt that the software firm is looking at Ordinals and assessing its potential in terms of application development. Often used to create NFT-like assets on top of Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January, and the pro...

“The whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,” Saylor said. “Right now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin.”

The Bitcoin advocate said that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could introduce an entirely new level of security.

“The platform consists of three fundamental pieces, Raczko said late Wednesday.

“At the heart of it is a service cloud, hosted, that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users in your organization,” he explained. “It also allows you to deploy prepackaged out-of-the-box applications that run on the MicroStrategy Orange platform.”

Raczko said the Orange software development kit will make it easy for coders to take these capabilities and integrate them into their own applications and systems.

Using email as an example, Raczko said Bitcoin-based public and private keys generated using MicroStrategy Orange would be inscribed using the Ordinals protocol.

[MicroStrategy Buys Even More Bitcoin, Pushing Stash to $13.5 Billion](https://decrypt.co/228660/microstrategy-buys-even-more-bitcoin-13-5-billion)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is again buying the dip. On Monday, the software firm and “Bitcoin development company” announced its Q1 2024 financial results, and took the opportunity to note that it has purchased even more Bitcoin since the end of March amid a rough few weeks for the crypto markets. MicroStrategy purchased 122 additional Bitcoin for a total of $7.8 million between April 1 and April 26, according to the report. While that’s smaller than many of the comp...

According to the MicroStrategy Orange documentation, the decentralized identity protocol uses a modified approach to [inscriptions](https://microstrategy.github.io/did-btc-spec/#inscriptions) as Ordinals, but stores only data related to decentralized identity (DID), meaning documents can be created and updated with few restrictions on size and content while taking advantage of the segregated witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin.

“Once you've established that that email is genuine, you accept the invitation, and at that point, we're going to generate your unique decentralized identifier, and the public and private key pair,” Raczko explained. “We're going to send a decentralized identifier and the public key to the Orange server to be inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain, \[and\] from that point onward, you are ready to start sending Orange-signed or emails.” &gt; BREAKING: LASER-EYE MAXIS IN ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES AS THEIR LORD AND SAVIOR [@SAYLOR](https://twitter.com/saylor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ANNOUNCES NEW “PROTOCOL” TO INSCRIBE DIGITAL IDENTITY DOCUMENTS ON THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN

“\[The\] opportunity we see and want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger, verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin,” Raczko said. He added that the MicroStrategy Orange decentralized identifier could also be used to verify users on social media applications or authenticate a text message, college degree or medical record. “Present those and then have those verified all in a decentralized way, but with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain,” Raczko added—suggesting that Orange could make it possible to display an “orange check” for verified users across platforms. _Edited by [Ryan Ozawa](https://decrypt.co/author/ryanozawa)._

Riot’s net income was boosted by a 131% year-on-year increase in Bitcoin’s price despite the cryptocurrency becoming more difficult and expensive to mine.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) mining firm Riot Platforms reported a $211.8 million net income for Q1 2024 — a company record and a 1,000% increase from the same time last year — but missed analyst revenue estimates.

Riot’s first quarter [results](https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/) released May 1 show minin revenue spiked 55.4% year-on-year to $74.6 million, primarily driven by a 131% increase in Bitcoin’s price.

The firm's total revenue was $79.3 million, fallin 14% short of [estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2266179/riot-platforms-inc-riot-q1-earnings-top-estimates#:~:text=of%20the%20Tape-,Riot%20Platforms%2C%20Inc) by research firm Zacks.

The miner said a rise in net income and mining revenue was partially slowed by lower Bitcoin production and higher mining costs due to an increase in Bitcoin’s network difficulty and hash rate.

Riot mined 1,364 BTC during Q1, [a 36% decrease](https://cointelegraph.com/news/riot-platforms-bitcoin-mining-production-halving) from 2023’s first quarter. Its average cost to mine 1 BTC was $23,000 — 144% more expensive compared to the same time last year which Riot said was “primarily driven by an increase of 89% in global network hash rate.”

Riot announced a [new facility](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-stocks-btc-halving) in Corsicana, Texas last month which CEO Jason Les believes will become the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world once fully developed.

**_Related:_** [**_Jack Dorsey’s Block announces development of ‘full Bitcoin mining system’_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/jack-dorsey-block-bitcoin-mining-system)

The mining firm claimed it was on track to increase its hash rate capacity from 12.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 31 EH/s before the end of the year.

It anticipates its hash rate will increase to 41 EH/s when its Corsicana facility fully deploys in 2025 and Riot has a long-term goal to reach 100 EH/s in 2027 or soon after.

Riot currently boasts the third largest hash rate among miners trailing only rivals Marathon Digital and Core Scientific at 24.7 EH/s and 16.9 EH/s respectively, [according](https://data.hashrateindex.com/stocks) to Hashrate Index.

Riot’s share price fell 2.87% over May 1 to $9.82, but is up 1.1% in after-hours trading, [according](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RIOT:NASDAQ) to Google Finance.

Bitcoin miners are adjusting after the blockchain’s mining rewards were cut in [the April 20 halving event](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-completion-confirmed) from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — the latter currently worth around $180,600.

![Image 1: 'Bitcoin Jesus' arrest raises concerns: 'The U.S. is coming after crypto!'](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _After Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao, Roger Ver is under the radar of the U.S. government._ 
*   _Diverse reactions within the crypto community highlight industry complexities amid legal actions._

The year 2024 is proving to be a golden age for cryptocurrencies, with the exponential growth of this asset class coinciding with a surge in crypto voters.

Notably, a significant portion of this surge in crypto adoption occurred after the 2020 presidential election. Following Biden’s election, there was an unprecedented wave of retail adoption within the cryptocurrency industry.

However, as the U.S. elections 2024 approaches, an unexpected development has emerged.

The United States Department of Justice has announced charges against Roger Ver, also known as [“Bitcoin Jesus,”](https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-jesus-charged-with-tax-fraud-and-arrested-in-spain/) on allegations of tax evasion.

#### **Diverging perspective** 

Various execs have weighed in on the matter, speculating that it is an anti-crypto stance within the Biden administration.

Highlighting consecutive arrests by the U.S. government, including Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, and now Roger Ver, [David Shares](https://twitter.com/DavidShares/status/1785399884205507071), a crypto expert noted, 

&gt; “The U.S. is aggressively coming after crypto. Just look at the recent targets. If you think you’re not a target, think again. They will come after all of us at some point. We have to fight!” 

Echoing similar sentiments, Jane Adams, a 2024 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and a supporter of Bitcoin, said, 

[![Image 2: Jane Adams tweet on Roger Ver's arrest](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201176%20366'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jane-Adams-tweet-1.webp)

However, some execs believed in the steps taken by the U.S. Voicing his apprehensions against Ver, Bitcoin educator, [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1785374820617650308) said, 

&gt; “Good. He’s been a net negative for Bitcoin.” 

Adding to the fray, an X user, @koinosthegoat, claimed, 

[![Image 3: @koinosthegoat tweet on Roger Ver's arrest](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201174%20802'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/@koinosthegoat-tweet-1.webp)

Source: @koinosthegoat/Twitter

These contrasting perspectives underscore the complexities and divisions within the crypto space, suggesting potential implications for the upcoming U.S. elections.

#### **What’s more to it?** 

As a matter of fact, Ver was arrested in Spain on the 30th of April, following criminal charges in the U.S. for offenses including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns.

The DoJ alleges that Ver avoided taxes totaling $48 million on his Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sales in 2017. According to a [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) by the DoJ,

[![Image 4: US-DoJ's press release](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201438%20364'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DoJs-press-release-1.webp)

Source: U.S. Department of Justice

However, despite renouncing his US citizenship in 2014, Ver faces extradition to the United States, prompting criticism from crypto veterans and social media users. 

Amidst this criticism, [Kim Dotcom](https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1785515855893450813), a crypto veteran who himself was in the same shoes a few years ago, remarked,

&gt; “This indictment has nothing to do with tax evasion. This is a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.” 

As things unfold, it will be interesting to watch how the upcoming U.S. elections will shape the future of cryptocurrency in the States.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/celestia-tia-price-correction-likely/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T23:59:00+00:00

Markdown Content:
**Celestia (TIA) is prone to further correction after consistently forming red candlesticks over the past few days. The saving grace is that investors are not too keen on saving the altcoin either.**

The most likely outcome for TIA is a five-month low since it follows the cues set by Bitcoin, which dropped below $60,000.

Celestia Investors Save Their Money
-----------------------------------

[Celestia’s price decline](https://beincrypto.com/celestia-tia-price-all-time-high/) resulted from the crypto market noting a bearish couple of days in the previous month. However, the broader impact has been on the traders who have opted to withdraw from the asset for now.

This is noted in the decline in the Open Interest (OI), which in the past month has been reduced by 50%. At the start of March, a total of $233 million worth of [shorts](https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-short-bitcoin/) and long contracts were opened in the market. This has since come down to $113 million, less than half of the original OI.

This shows that the investors only focus on profitable actions, which could take a while.

The reason behind this delay is the correlation that TIA shares with Bitcoin. A high correlation of 0.96 exhibits a tethered price action of both assets, with TIA following BTC’s cues. Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is witnessing a bearish outlook, with Bitcoin’s price trading below $60,000.

Further decline in BTC is anticipated, and the condition of Celestia’s price is also the same. Thus, the altcoin could observe some drawdown in the coming days.

TIA Price Prediction: Drop to $7 
---------------------------------

[Celestia’s price is testing the support](https://beincrypto.com/tia-holders-optmistic-price-april/) marked at $9.2, which could fail to hold, resulting in a price correction to the next area of support at $8.3. But if this level breaks, it would validate the bearish thesis, causing the TIA price to correct further and hit $7.

However, if the $8.3 support floor holds strong enough to prevent a decline, TIA could bounce back. Reclaiming the $10 would wipe out half the losses noted and invalidate the bearish thesis.

The [Build on Bitcoin](https://www.gobob.xyz/) (BOB) project announced the launch of its first phase on Wednesday, enabling decentralized apps—dapps—to interact with the world’s top blockchain.

The BOB mainnet is coming online with $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and over 40 dapps already available, the team [said](https://twitter.com/build_on_bob) on Twitter, declaring “a Bitcoin-driven DeFi summer” with more to come in the next three weeks.

Build on Bitcoin is intended to be a hybrid layer-2 network, an “Ethereum rollup” that merges [Bitcoin’s](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) global adoption, liquidity, and proof-of-work security with the decentralized finance (DeFi) features of [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide): smart contracts, wallets, and access to stablecoins.

In March, Bitcoin DeFi developer [Sovryn](https://decrypt.co/221633/bitcoin-defi-app-sovryn-expanding-ethereum-heres-how) used Build on Bitcoin to expand its offerings to the Ethereum ecosystem. BOB is meanwhile collaborating with Threshold’s [tBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tbtc) and [Wrapped BTC](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-wbtc-explained-bitcoin-ethereum-defi) (WBTC).

“We currently work with the two leading BTC bridge providers while working on our bridge infrastructure in parallel,” BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin told _Decrypt_. “We built a one-click onramp from Bitcoin to BOB that abstracts bridge complexity and makes moving liquidity from BTC to BOB as easy as moving from ETH to an ETH L2 going live next week.”

Zamyatin said Build on Bitcoin is also looking to provide a one-stop shop for Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, working with teams that provide bridges for Ordinals, Runes, and [BRC-20 tokens](https://decrypt.co/221254/bitcoin-ordinals-brc-20-token-standard-layer-1-foundation).

![Image 1: BOB Mainnet Launch Announcement](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Decrypt-Wallpaper-Format-1600-x-900-px-79.png@webp)

While [Bitcoin DeFi](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-defi-and-how-does-it-work) is the goal, the BOB team acknowledged that the number one blockchain is not ready, making “bootstrapping” on Ethereum necessary.

&gt; Why Bootstrapping?
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the high demand, Bitcoin rollups aren't ready yet. Our approach leverages Ethereum's established infrastructure to:
&gt; 
&gt; • Enhance UX for [#Ordinals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ordinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), [#Runes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Runes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), &amp; [#BRC20s](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BRC20s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).  
&gt; • Make BTC deployment into DeFi super easy, for both Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum users.
&gt; 
&gt; — BOB (Mainnet Live) (@build\_on\_bob) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/build_on_bob/status/1785601099195678901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“Connecting to Ethereum follows a pragmatic rollout approach,” the team said. “Bitcoin rollups do not yet work, but demand is high: Bitcoin users need access to stablecoins and DeFi, Ethereum users want to use their BTC and get access to Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s.”

“It is time to end the cult-like feuds and unite the two largest Web3 ecosystems to spearhead mass adoption together,” BOB declared.

According to Zamyatin, the next phase of BOB’s development will achieve Bitcoin proof of work via “merged mining,” enhancing security without disrupting Bitcoin mining. Merged mining refers to the process of mining two or more blockchains at the same time.

“Previous merged mining instances suffered from slow block times (30sec-1min) due to the limitations of Proof-of-Work,” he said.

Finally, the third planned phase will introduce BitVM, enabling a secure BTC bridge with fraud proofs similar to Ethereum's bridges, BOB explains, ensuring safe BTC deposits enforced by Bitcoin nodes.

“This ensures that users bridging in BTC can be certain that their deposits are safe and security is enforced by all Bitcoin full nodes—as long as there is at least one person online to submit a fraud-proof,” he said, noting Arbitrum on Ethereum.

To draw more users to its platform, Zamyatin pointed to a BOB fusion [program](https://app.gobob.xyz/fusion) that the company is using to boost adoption through dapps that increase the TVL and number of users.

According to the Build on Bob website, the total value locked on the platform is currently over $279 million.

“BOB Fusion Season 1 attracted 300 million in TVL from 33,000 users in 4 weeks,” Zamyatin said. “BOB Season 2 that launched today saw $64 million in on-chain TVL inflow in less than 12 hours.”

In wake of the cryptocurrency market’s latest tumble which saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop convincingly below $60,000 for the first time since late February, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/) was last trading in the $57,000s as traders digest the latest Fed policy announcement. [Negative ETF flows](https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-turn-negative-again-as-grayscale-sees-over-300m-in-outflows.htm) are also on their radar, with [Bitcoin ETFs](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-etfs/) having seen outflows now for five straight days.

![Image 5: As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01232829/1714606109-screenshot-2024-05-01-171258.png)

As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.

Most [altcoins](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-altcoins/) are also in the red. That is encouraging traders looking to turn a quick profit to turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.

On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.

Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or [scams](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm). But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.

Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.

That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on [Ethereum](https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/), as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/).

**Top Crypto Gainers Today**
----------------------------

### **AITaxBot (AITAX)**

A newly launched crypto called AITaxBot (AITAX) is up 1800% on Wednesday, as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xe9bbb36d439f7b2be56ce7d426260079a2899502).

The shitcoin last had a market cap of $370,000, with $130,000 in locked liquidity, with volumes so far of $520,000.

The token has four concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per Go+ Security. Investors need to be cautious.

### **America (AMERICA)**

A meme coin called America (AMERICA) that was launched three days ago continues to push higher.

It was last up 220% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $5.1 million as per [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x66d5871236685ec4470142b6ed86b61fcad0059a). It also has a solid $260,000 in locked liquidity.

The meme coin has been on a donating spree to US veterans.

&gt; 🚨BREAKING: $AMERICA ([@0x1776America](https://twitter.com/0x1776America?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) on ETH has Officially Donated $10,000 to Veterans in the First 24 Hours of Launch!

Donations to good causes are an interesting and commendable marketing strategy for a meme coin.

That could explain why AMERICA keeps pumping. Hopefully, it sets a trend.

The token has two smart contract issues, as per Go+ Security.

### **Book of Ethereum (BOOE)**

A meme coin called Book of Ethereum (BOOE) challenged its record highs on Wednesday following a 50% intra-day gains.

That according to [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xdeba8fd61c1c87b6321a501ebb19e61e610421bf), that puts its market cap at $3.3 million and liquidity at $270,000.

&gt; As it was written…[$BOOE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BOOE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) | [@Bookof\_Eth](https://twitter.com/Bookof_Eth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is sending 📈

BOOE has no issues with its smart contract and appears not to be a scam. That being said, investors must always do their due diligence and remember that the vast majority of newly launched coins do not retain long-term value.

**Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales**
----------------------------------------------------------


If traders can reliably identify [altcoin gems](https://cryptonews.com/news/hidden-gem-is-this-the-next-1000-potential-altcoin.htm), they can make a lot of money.

But the over-looked strategy of investing in [presales](https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm) can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.

[Web3](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-web3/) projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.

If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.

Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.

That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.

An Argentinian lawmaker has launched a draft bill that proposes regulating [Worldcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/worldcoin/) and its operator in [the Latin American nation](https://cryptonews.com/news/argentina-regulator-we-want-to-work-with-crypto-firms-to-police-industry.htm).

The move comes just days [after Worldcoin announced a planned expansion in Mexico.](https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-operator-announces-mexico-expansion-despite-potential-probe.htm) Some Mexican lawmakers have also called for a probe into operator Tools for Humanity.

Argentina Lawmaker: We Must Protect Consumer Rights
---------------------------------------------------


Per [the official news outlet of the Buenos Aires assembly](https://diputadosbsas.com.ar/legislatura-bonaerense-regular-empresas-escanean-ojos-criptomonedas/), the new bill is the brainchild of Buenos Aires parliament member Carlos Puglelli.

The MP, and others, have claimed it is “unclear” what Worldcoin does with the biometric data it collects using its iris-scanning drives.

Puglelli’s bill proposes “regulating companies that scan people’s irises for the purpose of collecting biometric data.”

The bill’s author noted that Buenos Aires authorities should be allowed to “exercise control over activities carried out by companies like Worldcoin.”

[![Image 5: a black screen with the words cofpoker on it](https://cimg.co/other/907/337300/coinpoker-960x200-cryptonews.png)](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/outgoing/907/1/5)

He also called for more “transparency” about happens to the biometric data that “users deliver to these companies, in this case in exchange for a payment in cryptocurrency.”

Worldcoin has proven a hit in Argentina, where it operates over 50 iris-scanning centers.

Buenos Aires MPs Want Worldcoin Investigation
---------------------------------------------


The crypto project has piqued the interest of more Argentina lawmakers.

In mid-April, Romina Braga, another member of the Buenos Aires assembly, called for an official investigation into Worldcoin.

Braga called on Axel Kicillof, the Governor of the Buenos Aires Province, to commission an investigation. She also voiced several privacy and data-related concerns.

![Image 6: A Worldcoin retina scanner orb.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01151909/1714576748-51303325070_e6b55ce833_k.jpg)

(Source: Steve Jurvetson \[CC By 2.0\]) This follows a move from the national data protection agency, which announced the launch of an investigation into Worldcoin in January this year. Puglelli’s bill calls for the creation of a “regulatory framework” that regulates biometric data collection and introduces punishments for any “abuse” of this data. He explained: &gt; “It is essential to adapt our legislation to meet the challenges posed by the digital era.” Regulator to Get Involved? -------------------------- The bill, if adopted, would see the Provincial Directorate for the Defense of the Rights of Consumers and Users appointed as the “supervisor” of Worldcoin. The Directorate would be charged with “promoting fair and equitable consumer relations in the digital sphere, as well as trust and IT security.” &gt; UK data watchdog to make enquiries about Worldcoin crypto project [https://t.co/nT2PYkzz5P](https://t.co/nT2PYkzz5P) [pic.twitter.com/VESSVtp0i9](https://t.co/VESSVtp0i9)

The media outlet [Criptonoticias](https://www.criptonoticias.com/regulacion/argentina-ley-worldcoin-criptomonedas-buenosaires-datos-biometrico/) reported that Worldcoin has been operating in Argentina “for more than a year.”

It added that “thousands of citizens have transferred their biometric data to the Cayman Islands-based firm.”

Will Lawmakers Get Their Way?
-----------------------------


Both Puglelli and Braga have complained that “it is not clear” exactly “what Worldcoin does with iris-scanned data.”

The lawmaker warned that Worldcoin “has no legal status in Argentina and is acquiring biometric data in a way that puts privacy at stake.”.

It remains to be seen if the lawmakers’ warnings will dampen public enthusiasm.

However, they do not appear to be alone. The Buenos Aires Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation says it has also investigated Worldcoin’s data protection credentials.

Mexican lawmakers have also raised concerns. In Chile, another country with multiple data collection centers, government agents have inspected three Worldcoin-related addresses.

Agents asked the firm to submit “additional information” to “ensure that Worldcoin is complying with national regulations.”

Data-related concerns have disrupted Worldcoin iris-scanning efforts in European nations, including Spain, Germany, and [France](https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-discontinues-its-orb-verification-services-in-india-brazil-and-france.htm).

Government agencies in [East Asian](https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-controversy-benefiting-south-koreas-bithumb-exchange.htm) nations such as [South Korea](https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korea-worldcoin-investigation-data-collection-concerns.htm) and [Hong Kong](https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-crypto-project-hong-kong-probe-privacy-concerns.htm) have also launched Worldcoin-related investigations.

Best Crypto to Buy Now May 1 – Wormhole, Optimism, Axelar

As traders digest the implications of the latest Fed policy announcement and what it means for the outlook for Fed rate cuts later this year, traders are hunting for opportunities in the altcoin market and weighing up what might be the best crypto to buy today.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/v) (BTC) was last trading in the $57,000s, down over 4% in the past 24 hours.

[Ether](https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/) (ETH) was last trading about 1% lower just to the south of $3,000.

The sell pressure comes as [Bitcoin ETF outflows pick up](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-continue-to-see-net-outflows-as-btc-price-drops.htm) and [US economic data points to sticky inflation](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-inflation-rises-line-with-expectations-march-2024-04-26/).

As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.

This has dampened the outlook for Fed rate cuts, with most now expecting nothing until late 2024.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/) bears are now targeting a test of support in the $53,000. This could be a compelling area to buy the dip.

Bitcoin would have fallen around 30% from its March highs at this point. Assuming we are in a bull market, many long-term bulls might view a 30% retracement as a great time to get back in.

That suggests Bitcoin could soon be the [best coin to buy](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-to-buy/), but it isn’t yet.

Investors looking to bank quick gains will have to be more selective, finding [altcoins](https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/) with strong momentum.

Here are some strong-performing [altcoins](https://es.cryptonews.com/noticias/altcoin-news/) on Wednesday that could be the best crypto to buy today.

**Best Crypto to Buy Today**
----------------------------

### **Wormhole (W)**

Investors monitoring altcoins markets for which crypto to invest in on Wednesday should check out Wormhole (W).

Wormhole is the top-performing coin in the top 100 by market cap on Monday, as per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wormhole/).

W was last up 11% in 24 hours and is probing two-week highs around $0.68.

Wormhole is a multi-chain protocol that facilitates the movement of assets and data between blockchains.

If it can break above recent highs in the $0.70 area, a quick rally back towards $1.0 is possible.

![Image 7: Wormhole might be the best crypto to buy today.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01225647/1714604206-screenshot-2024-05-01-173836.png)

### **Optimism (OP)**

Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution Optimism (OP) is pushing back towards weekly highs above $2.70.

It was last up 7.5% in the past 24 hours as per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/), making it a top-performing coin on Wednesday.

OP is currently in a short-term uptrend. But bulls won’t be celebrating until it can break to the north of resistance around $2.85.

But given it recently broke above a downtrend from the March highs, OP’s outlook is strong.

![Image 8: Given it recently broke above a downtrend from the March highs, OP’s outlook is strong.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01225716/1714604236-screenshot-2024-05-01-174149.png)

It could soon pump back to $4.0 or above. The prospect of quick gains makes it potentially the best crypto to buy today.

### **Axelar (AXL)**

Web3 interoperability platform Axelar (AXL) is pumping on Wednesday, up 8.5% in 24 hours as per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axelar/).

Last at $1.15, the cryptocurrency has found strong support above $1.0 this week.

Traders will be hoping this bounce could be the start of a more than 2x push higher back above $2.0.

If this is the start of a new AXL run, it could well be the best crypto to buy today.

But first, it will need to surpass $1.30 resistance.

**Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales**
----------------------------------------------------------


If traders can reliably identify altcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.

But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.

Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to offer a Canadian dollar stablecoin on its platform shortly after receiving an official license to operate within the country.

[In a Twitter update on Monday](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1785001092301939089), the company said it had added QCAD (QCAD) to its listing roadmap – a CAD-pegged stablecoin that was “re-launched” by Canadian fintech firm Stablecorp last year.

Canadian Dollar Stablecoin On Coinbase
--------------------------------------


Much like other popular stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), QCAD maintains its peg with full backing by reserves of equal or greater value to the number of tokens that have been issued.

According to Stablecorp, these tokens are backed by cash and cash equivalents, with monthly [attestation reports](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3835790-1&amp;h=877463978&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstablecorp.ca%2Fqcad-attestation&amp;a=Monthly+attestation+reports) to verify their reserve status. Its latest attestation report in February 2024 said there were just 169,303.77 QCAD in circulation versus $200,903.17 in Stablecorp’s reserves.

&gt; Assets added to the roadmap today: QCAD (QCAD)[https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2](https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2)

That’s a small amount relative to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC, which have over $140 billion USD worth of tokens combined spread throughout the crypto ecosystem.

[![Image 5](https://cimg.co/p/assets/empty-cryptonews.jpg)](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/outgoing/908/1/5)

“Our goal is to list every asset possible that meets our standards for legal, compliance, and technical security,” Coinbase’s [blog post](https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/blog/increasing-transparency-for-new-asset-listings-on-coinbase) on upcoming listings stated. “These standards do not take into account the market cap or popularity of a project.”

As such, onboarding Coinbase – the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the only publicly traded firm of its kind – could be a boon for adoption.

“With increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin,” said Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall last year.

Compliance With Canadian Regulators
-----------------------------------


Shortly after the collapse of FTX and Terra in 2022, the [CSA issued guidance to crypto trading platforms](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/2/21-333/csa-staff-notice-21-333-crypto-asset-trading-platforms-terms-and-conditions-trading-value), establishing a high bar for stablecoins or other pegged assets to receive listing. Stablecoins would require reserves of “highly liquid assets” with “qualified custodians,” and [algorithmic stablecoins](https://cryptonews.com/news/iron-finance-s-algorithmic-stablecoins-warning-hits-mark-cub-10728.htm) were completely ruled out.

The strict guidance contributed to Kraken and Coinbase delisting USDT and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from their platforms and to Binance moving out of the country entirely.

Coinbase, however, became the first international crypto exchange to [gain registration as a “restricted dealer”](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-obtains-registration-as-a-restricted-dealer-in-canada) in Canada last month, signaling its sufficient compliance with regulators.

The company has often credited Canadian regulators with being cooperative with the crypto industry in ways that U.S. regulators are not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, is currently [suing Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance](https://cryptonews.com/news/support-for-coinbase-industry-leaders-call-on-sec-to-draft-clear-crypto-regulations.htm) for securities law violations.

“We’ve collaborated with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to demonstrate our dedication to facilitating their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset realm,” the company wrote last month.

Stacks Price Prediction as STX Token Slides Under $2 – How Low Will STX Go?

As Bitcoin (BTC) corrects to its lowest levels in over two months below $60,000, its largest layer-2 scaling blockchain Stacks (STX) is also in decline, with the Stacks price hitting its lowest levels since mid-February below $2.0.

The Stacks price has since bounced back to around $2.14, with STX now flat on the day.

But it might not be long until [STX](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/what-is-stacks.htm) breaks more forcefully to the downside of $2.06 and the $2.0 level.

That’s because Stacks largely takes it cue from what [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/) is doing, as well as how [altcoins](https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/) are performing.

And, as of now, pretty much the entire crypto space in a state of bearishness.

[Spot Bitcoin ETF flows](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-continue-to-see-net-outflows-as-btc-price-drops.htm) have been negative now for five days, as per data presented by The Block.

![Image 5: As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01232829/1714606109-screenshot-2024-05-01-171258.png)

As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.

That’s not surprising given [recent macro headwinds](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-traders-target-test-of-53000-support-as-btc-price-predictions-remains-bearish-following-fed-meeting.htm). While [today’s Fed policy announcement](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-hold-rates-steady-inflation-dims-hopes-policy-easing-2024-05-01/) didn’t contain any surprises, it reinforced the message that rate cuts remain some way off.

The Fed has turned more hawkish recently due to inflation remaining uncomfortably high since the start of 2024.

It’s no surprise then that the [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) price, as well as [altcoin](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-are-altcoins/) markets, have suffered a correction.

**Here’s Where the Stacks Price Is Headed Next**
------------------------------------------------


So, risks seem tilted to the downside for [Stacks (STX)](https://cryptonews.com/news/stacks-stx-value-drops-investors-move-towards-algotech-algt.htm). The next major support level, assuming the January highs at $2.06 goes, is the 200DMA.

The 200DMA currently resides just above $1.80. A break below here would send a significant bearish signal.

The next major area of support that traders would target would be around $1.25.

If Stacks was to fall 40% to here, its market cap would subside to under $2 billion.

This could be a great time to load up on STX, which remains a major leader in [Bitcoin layer-2 scaling](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoins-layer-2-ecosystem-is-booming-as-fourth-halving-approaches.htm).

![Image 7: The Stacks price could slump all the way as low as $1.25 support.](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02000135/1714608095-screenshot-2024-05-01-185951.png)

Amid the bearish outlook for altcoins like Stacks, traders are hunting for alternatives that could deliver near-term upside.

Presale investing is an often-overlooked strategy that can deliver strong returns.

And one presale has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews – [Mega Dice](https://cryptonews.com/ext/dice/).

The well-established crypto casino just launched a presale of its utility token DICE.

DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.

The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience turbulence, **Bitcoin** BTC/USD might be on the brink of a significant upswing, according to historical data.

**What Happened**: **Ali Martinez**, a prominent crypto analyst, took to social media platform X to share a promising insight. Martinez highlighted the potential for a substantial Bitcoin surge, based on historical trends.

“The last three times the #Bitcoin 30-day MVRV dropped below -9% in the last two years, the price of $BTC surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. The #BTC 30-day MVRV is currently at -11.6%, suggesting it may be time to buy the dip!” Martinez wrote.

The MVRV ratio, which divides an asset’s market capitalization by its realized capitalization, is a pivotal metric in the crypto space. A higher MVRV ratio typically indicates a greater potential profit, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.

**Why It Matters**: This insight comes at a time when the crypto market is facing significant challenges. On the same day, [Bitcoin’s value dropped below $58,000](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38546976/bitcoin-plummets-below-58k-eth-sol-doge-follow-over-400m-liquidated-in-deepest-retrace-in-), triggering losses for other major cryptocurrencies like **Ethereum** ETH/USD, **Solana** SOL/USD, and **Dogecoin** DOGE/USD.

Moreover, [crypto research firm 10x Research](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38560890/why-bitcoin-might-drop-another-20-10x-research) has predicted a further 20% drop in Bitcoin’s value, citing the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.

However, if Martinez’s analysis holds true, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a remarkable recovery. This is particularly noteworthy in light of [concerns raised by analysts](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38562986/bitcoin-etf-retail-degens-could-start-selling-their-positions-at-58k-analyst-warns) about potential selling pressure from retail “degens” who bought Bitcoin ETFs at around $58,000.

**Price Action**: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, it has seen an impressive 30.48% increase since the beginning of the year, according to the data [from Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard).

MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)), has announced it will launch a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin network that uses Ordinal-based inscriptions to store and retrieve information.

The solution, MicroStrategy Orange, was unveiled by executive chairman Michael Saylor [during](https://www.microstrategy.com/video/bitcoin-for-corporations-2024) the company’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.

MicroStrategy Orange is open-source, not dependent on sidechains and can process up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers in a single Bitcoin transaction, Saylor claimed.

“\[Its aim is to\] deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public Bitcoin blockchain as a data source,” [according](https://microstrategy.github.io/did-btc-spec/) to an unofficial draft document of the solution shared by MicroStrategy on GitHub.

The decentralized identifiers (DIDs) will allow pseudonymity in the same way that real-world identities are not tied to Bitcoin addresses and transactions.

MicroStrategy Orange comprises Orange Service, Orange SDK and Orange Applications.

Orange Service allows users to issue DIDs to their personnel and deploy applications, while Orange SDK and Orange Applications provide them with customization tools to integrate specific services on mobile and desktop devices.

One such application already built by MicroStrategy is “Orange For Outlook” — which integrates digital signatures into emails to ensure recipients can verify the true identity of the sender.

The onboarding process involves accepting an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, which will then generate a unique DID, a public and private key pair for the user.

[The user’s DID and public key](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-decentralized-identities-are-reshaping-our-communities-and-digital-identities-interview-with-did) are inscribed on the Bitcoin network, who can then start sending out invitations to their personnel to create their own digital identity.

The firm wants MicroStrategy Orange applications to extend to other messaging platforms, social media networks and applications in the e-commerce, enterprise and fintech industries.

It comes as MicroStrategy reported a [$53.1 million net loss](https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-records-q1-net-loss-bitcoin-buying-spree-continues) for the first quarter on April 30.

However, the reporting under the traditional accounting method didn’t factor in the 65% increase inthe market value of MicroStrategy’s 214,400 Bitcoin — worth $15.2 billion at the time — over the quarter.

The United States’ spot Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) exchange-traded funds (ETF) have posted record net outflows with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also seeing its first-ever outflow day.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund saw $36.6 million flow out on May 1, [according](https://twitter.com/HODL15Capital/status/1785841649265844411) to HODL15 Capital.

Nine other Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined $526.8 million in outflows — the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) was the only one with zero flows, [per](https://farside.co.uk/?p=1321) preliminary Farside Investors data.

The largest outflow for the day was the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $191.1million in net outflows.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was second with an outflow of $167.4 million.

It is the largest single outflow day for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Bitcoin ETF at $98.1 million and $13.4 million in outflows, respectively.

It comes as Bitcoin has fallen 10.7% over the last week.

However, ETF Store president Nate Geraci pointed out that the iShares Gold ETF and SPDR Gold ETFs have had $1 billion and $3 billion in outflows so far this year.

Yet, gold is up 16% year-to-date, Geraci [noted](https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1785849570552852579) in a May 2 X post.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart [noted](https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1785843582420541666) that the Bitcoin ETFs are still “operating smoothly across the board” and that “inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF.”

Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as it has entered a ‘danger zone,’ according to prominent gold advocate Peter Schiff. This investor, known for his skepticism toward Bitcoin, [suggests](https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1785420040281436398) that the cryptocurrency is entering a “do or die” phase, potentially marking the end of its bullish run if [current trends continue](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-greed-sentiment-neutral-57000-plunge/).

Breaking Points And Bearish Signals
-----------------------------------

Peter Schiff has often voiced his bearish outlook on Bitcoin, and his latest comments come as Bitcoin has just slipped below the crucial $60,000 mark.

This level had previously served as strong support during the short-term bull run, and its breach has intensified the bearish sentiment among investors. Schiff warns that staying below this threshold could spell doom for the bullish fervor, potentially derailing [Bitcoin’s momentum](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-milestone-ahead-analyst-forecasts-new-peak-this-month/).

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $57,054, teetering close to its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Schiff points out that remaining below this EMA could confirm a bearish trend, signaling an end to the rally.

Amidst these developments, the market has seen an increase in trading volume, coupled with the price drop, indicating strong selling pressure.

Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped from $45 billion to $48 billion, coinciding with a 6.3% price dip during the same period. This heightened activity is a [traditional bearish](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/if-history-rhymes-bitcoin-price-next-6-months/) indicator, lending weight to Schiff’s [prediction of a downturn](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons/).

Moreover, investor sentiment is treading thin ice with significant outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, hitting a weekly high of $162 million. This departure of funds is particularly poignant as it unfolds just before the FOMC meeting, where potential interest rate hikes are on the agenda.

These outflows reflect a broader market trend, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experiencing a substantial daily outflow of $93.23 million.

&gt; According to SoSoValue, total net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs yesterday, April 30, were as high as $162 million. GrayscaleETF GBTC had a single-day net outflow of US$93.2277 million, and the current historical net outflow of GBTC is US$17.303 billion.

The Bitcoin ETF Conundrum And Market Forecasts
----------------------------------------------

It is worth noting that last month was quite challenging for US Bitcoin ETFs. After a promising start with positive inflows in the initial months following their launch, April witnessed collective outflows amounting to $182 million across all active spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.

This pullback is attributed to macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions, which have clouded the investment landscape.

As the market braces for further turbulence, analysts such as Micheal Van de Poppe are [forecasting](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1785364388330824109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) an additional correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price [down to $55,000](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-nosedives-60k/) before any sign of recovery.

&gt; Monthly close approaching for [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and FOMC day tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we’ll see that sweep beneath $60K and potentially cascade towards $55-58K from which we’re finding the low and rotate back upwards.

In the face of growing global regulatory pressure on the crypto industry, the Biden administration’s intensified crackdown and the actions of regulatory bodies have prompted Senator Cynthia Lummis to issue a strong statement against the US government’s stance on the industry. 

Senator Lummis, a prominent supporter of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, has advocated for the companies and players involved in the ongoing regulatory pressure.

Lummis Condemns DOJ’s “Hyper-Aggressive” Stance
-----------------------------------------------

Lummis expressed deep concern and [opposed](https://x.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367) the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” argument that non-custodial software could be classified as a money transmission service. 

The Senator deemed this stance contradictory to existing Treasury guidance, lacking common sense, and violating the rule of law. 

Lummis further emphasized that arguments against self-custody software pose a threat to fundamental property rights that are intrinsic to being an American. 

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714620874948955&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fsen-lummis-challenges-us-crackdown-on-crypto-market%2F&amp;hc=38222fa9c269d04e4814ee811bf2df3a8df48d11&amp;location=)

Lummis asserted her commitment to fighting for individuals’ rights to hold their keys and operate their nodes, expressing her dismay at the Biden administration’s criminalization of the core tenets of the Bitcoin (BTC) network and [decentralized finance](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-go-up-senator-lummis/) (DeFi).

Senator Lummis had previously [disapproved](https://bitcoinist.com/senator-lummis-criticizes-secs-crypto-crackdown/) [](https://bitcoinist.com/senator-lummis-criticizes-secs-crypto-crackdown/)of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) escalated crackdown on the crypto industry throughout 2023. [![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714620875108087&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fsen-lummis-challenges-us-crackdown-on-crypto-market%2F&amp;hc=a3895f353f4935f5b099b926be8b8da8775879bf&amp;location=)

Criticizing the SEC’s actions as “unnecessary” and “overreaching,” she specifically opposed the agency’s controversial new crypto policy, known as “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,” issued in March 2022. 

Lummis had also filed an [amicus brief](https://bitcoinist.com/cynthia-lummis-backs-coinbase/) in support of the Coinbase exchange against the SEC’s lawsuit, arguing that Congress should be responsible for formulating crypto regulations rather than the SEC. 

The pro-crypto Senator contended that the SEC had exceeded its mandate by attempting to classify almost all crypto assets as “securities,” thus infringing on Congress’s legislative authority and extending beyond the agency’s jurisdiction.

Clear Guidelines For Crypto Regulation
--------------------------------------

In another statement supporting key players in the crypto market, Senator Lummis called for immediate action to establish clear [regulatory guidelines](https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lummis-calls-for-crypto-transparency/) in response to Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP should not be considered a security. 

At the core of the debate is the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an investment qualifies as a security. Lummis has emphasized the importance of preserving the integrity of this test while acknowledging the need to apply it appropriately to digital assets.

To address these issues, Senator Lummis, in collaboration with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, has introduced the Lummis-Gillibrand bill. The legislation aims to provide regulatory clarity for [digital assets](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-can-be-the-standard-lummis/) like XRP, aligning their treatment with the interpretation of the Howey Test as established by the Southern District of New York.
