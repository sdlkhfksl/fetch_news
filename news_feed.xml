URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/venom-foundation-launched-scam-nft-project/

Markdown Content:
Here we go again. Another day, another negative report that further exposes Venom Foundation’s utter shadiness. If you remember, last year, we wrote two exclusive [reports](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-fall-of-venom-foundation-cautionary-tale/) on the company that [detailed](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/murders-fraud-venom-networks-owner-exposed/) its inside operations and the alleged notorious secret founder, Alibek Issaev.

And now, we have been approached by [Venom Punks](https://twitter.com/venom_punks), the first-ever [NFT](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/nft/) project on the Venom network with yet another inside look at Venom Foundation, its centralization and fraud, the team that initially founded the project, and why the current team wants nothing to do with the foundation anymore.

The beginning
-------------

The journey of Venom Punks began with high hopes in late 2022, when the team behind the project first explored the potential of the Venom [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/). Envisioned as a platform that supported fair competition and innovation, Venom initially attracted Venom Punks with its promise of decentralization and support for developers. However, the reality they encountered was starkly different because Venom Foundation operates in a very centralized manner.

As Venom Punks set out to develop their project, which included launching several dApps like VenomSea and Wrapped Venom Station, they noticed a troubling pattern. Another project, venom-punks.com, not only mirrored their initiatives but also seemed to receive undue support from the Venom Foundation. This copycat project was reportedly backed by the foundation to the extent that it overshadowed the original efforts of Venom Punks.

&gt; “**_Venom Foundation seems more like a centralized chain, run like a family business. This setup could favor family, friends, and relatives, giving them advantages over other builders. For builders not close to the Venom Team, this means limited success chances._**“
&gt; 
&gt; Venom Punks

Venom Punks set up accounts on Discord, Twitter, and launched its domain in January of 2023. Venom Punks said they reported the scam collection in May of the same year after thorough research, and decided to take a stand and expose what they described as fraudulent activities by the Venom Foundation.

They revealed that venom-punks.com, despite its lack of originality, thrived with direct foundation support, overshadowing Venom Punks’ genuine efforts. The climax of their accusations pointed to a possible collusion between the foundation and venom-punks.com to clone Venom Punks’ original NFT designs and concepts. Venom Foundation’s current CEO Christopher Louis Tsu even went on Twitter to publicly endorse the scam collection.

A major turning point occurred when Slava Semenchuk, known by his Discord username Venominator, joined the Venom Punks Discord server on March 30 this year. His alleged intention was to defend venom-punks.com.

Semenchuk tried to portray the project as legitimate and gain from the original Venom Punks’ popularity, presenting himself as an innocent party caught in a misunderstanding. However, his presence and actions quickly raised suspicions among the vigilant Venom Punks community.

The Venom Punks team, equipped with solid evidence of the deceptive practices of venom-punks.com, confronted Semenchuk, who found himself unable to substantiate his claims and eventually left the server. His departure was not quiet, though.

He inadvertently confirmed the suspicions of many by exposing a direct link between the scam project and the Venom Foundation.

The clone war
-------------

The association between the scam project and Venom Foundation was confirmed by Venom Punks through multiple channels, including public discussions and promotional materials where the foundation’s support for the clone project was openly acknowledged.

These actions raised serious ethical questions. Was the foundation’s involvement a calculated move to push out the original innovators in favor of a controlled, less threatening project that they could manipulate? After all, they’re not really decentralized.

The extent of the foundation’s duplicity became clearer through the actions of the clone project’s founder. Not only did he launch a project with the same name, but he also engaged in misleading marketing tactics and false advertising, including offering nonexistent features and promotions to attract users.

When these deceitful strategies were brought to light, rather than retracting or apologizing, he doubled down, attempting to cover his tracks and continue his deceptive practices. These practices included the abrupt removal of outrageous offers, like a supposed trip to Dubai, from their website when they were called out for being unrealistic.

Moreover, the clone project’s readiness to launch on the same day as the original Venom Punks’ minting phase, as revealed by their conflicting mint date announcements, was a direct attack aimed at diverting traffic and sales from the original to the clone.

A tense moment came when CEO Christopher unintentionally acknowledged the legitimate VenomPunks.com in a public response. This slip triggered a strong reaction from the venom-punks.com team, particularly their leader, who seemed visibly upset and even threatened to undermine the Venom Foundation. This reaction raises a serious question. What secret agreements are at play behind the scenes?

Despite the ongoing support from the Venom Foundation, venom-punks.com has openly criticized the foundation, accusing it of being disorganized. The irony of this situation is striking. Here is a project that, despite its questionable legitimacy and the foundation’s backing, publicly denounces the very organization that supports it. Kind of disturbing.

Then came the involvement of Oasis Gallery. Official statements from the foundation described Oasis Gallery as an independent third-party dApp. However, contradicting this claim, the venom-punks.com team indicated that the gallery was closely linked to the Venom Foundation, suggesting the foundation had major influence or even control over Oasis operations.

The legitimacy of VenomPunks.com was further compromised when Oasis Gallery listed their collection without consent and initially marked it as verified, potentially to boost its visibility and sales. However, just minutes after realizing the implications of their actions, the foundation requested the removal of the listing from the homepage.

This rapid sequence of actions demonstrated a deliberate attempt to manipulate market visibility to favor the scam project over the legitimate creators. When Venom Punks requested the removal of their collection from Oasis Gallery to maintain control over their project’s presentation and sales, their requests were blatantly ignored.

Internal struggles
------------------

The Venom Foundation has been facing some serious internal and financial challenges, starting with the departure of former CEO Mustafa Kheriba. The reasons behind the delayed launch of its mainnet are deeply tied to the organizational shake-up and the parting ways of Kheriba’s financial investment company with the foundation.

Post-Kheriba, the Venom Foundation experienced operational difficulties, primarily because it outsourced most tasks and its team worked remotely. The setup began to crumble as financial constraints became apparent. The lack of adequate compensation led to a mass exodus of professionals who were essential to the foundation’s operations, leaving the foundation struggling with an underqualified and understaffed team.

Further complicating matters, VenomPunks.com claimed to have uncovered troubling inconsistencies within the Venom ecosystem, particularly with how certain data was being handled and displayed. For instance, VenomArt and VenomScan were found displaying the total supply of the “Drunk Soda” collection as 2,750, despite the smart contract showing a total of zero.

![Image 2: a screen shot of a website showing a cartoon character](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png)

This discrepancy raises serious questions about the reliability of the foundation’s technology and its adherence to blockchain standards, specifically the TIP4 protocol mandated by RFC2119. Finally, the VenomPunks.com team decided to confront the foundation with evidence of misconduct involving the scam project, venom-punks.com.

Initially, there was hope that presenting this evidence would prompt the foundation to take corrective actions. However, instead of addressing the issues, the foundation alerted the scam project, leading to an attempt by both parties to erase the evidence.

Venom-punks.com’s response to the exposure was to distance itself from the foundation, claiming that it was not an official project of the Venom Foundation. This claim came too late and seemed like a desperate attempt to salvage whatever was left of its reputation.

The culmination of these issues has led VenomPunks.com to make a difficult but necessary decision — to leave the Venom chain. The foundation’s inability to maintain a fair and competitive environment, combined with its failure to support and protect genuine developers, has forced VenomPunks.com to seek a new platform where integrity and equal opportunities are valued.

A security researcher was rewarded $250,000 for discovering a vulnerability that has historically allowed hackers to pull out millions of dollars from cryptocurrency protocols. 

Pseudonymous cybersecurity researcher Marco Croc from Kupia Security identified a reentrancy vulnerability in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance.

In an X thread, he [explained](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675) how the bug could be exploited to manipulate balances and withdraw funds from liquidity pools.

Curve Finance acknowledged potential security flaws and “recognized the severity of the vulnerability,” Marco Croc explained. After a thorough investigation, Curve Finance awarded Marco Croc its maximum bug bounty award of $250,000.

According to Curve Finance, the threat was classified as “not as dangerous,” and they believed they could recover the stolen funds in such a case. 

However, the protocol said a security incident of any scale “could have caused serious panic if it had happened.”

Curve Finance recently recovered from a $62 million hack in July. As part of returning to normalcy, the DeFi protocol voted to reimburse $49.2 million worth of assets to the liquidity providers (LPs).

_Source: [Curve Finance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1737998103188553846)_

On-chain data confirms that 94% of tokenholders approved the disbursement of tokens worth over $49.2 million to cover the losses of the Curve, JPEG’d (JPEG), Alchemix (ALCX) and Metronome (MET) pools.

According to Curve’s proposal, the community fund will supply the Curve DAO (CRV) tokens. The final amount also includes a deduction for the tokens recovered since the incident.

“The overall ETH ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) to recover was calculated as 5919.2226 ETH, the CRV to recover was calculated as 34,733,171.51 CRV and the total to distribute was calculated as 55’544’782.73 CRV,” reads the proposal.

The attacker exploited a vulnerability on stable pools using some versions of the Vyper programming language. The bug made Vyper’s 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 versions vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

[Bitcoin](https://qz.com/bitcoin-history-creation-origin-price-1851347621) has continued its April wipeout into May, falling almost all the way to $57,000 on Wednesday morning and technically entering into a bear market after [its worst month in almost a year-and-a-half](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-on-pace-for-its-worst-month-since-november-2022-heres-whats-driving-the-decline-e168ddad?&amp;mod=home-page).

The ongoing selloff, which had Bitcoin’s price sitting at $57,075 early Wednesday morning, follow’s [April’s closely watched “halving” event](https://qz.com/bitcoin-halving-event-cryptocurrency-price-buy-mining-1851406085) and comes ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Bitcoin is now more than 20% below its record high of $73,803 set in March, though it’s still up about 30% so far this year.

Bitcoin’s previous halving events, in which the reward for miners who create more Bitcoin is cut in half, has typically been followed by big rallies in the cryptocurrency’s price. [But analysts had warned that might not be the case this time](https://qz.com/bitcoin-bicoin-halving-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-1851418943).

Bitcoin continued to shed its value Tuesday as Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs failed to impress investors on their debut. [Recently, six crypto-related ETFs were listed](https://qz.com/bitcoin-hong-kong-etf-1851410344) on the Hong Kong exchange. Bitcoin ETFs contributed $8.5 million in volume, while Ether ETFs brought in $2.5 million. As a comparison, the issuers anticipated an initial volume of $100 million, as [per media reports](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/asias-first-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-gain-hong-kong-debut-2024-04-30/).  

Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. are struggling, too, with a total net inflow of $11 billion — which could have been much better if Grayscale’s GBTC had seen any inflows. According to [investment firm Farside](https://farside.co.uk/?p=997), GBTC has experienced outflows for over a month, totaling $17 billion since April 11. Over the past three days, Fidelity’s FBTC also has witnessed continuous outflows totaling $31 million.

**TL;DR**

*   Despite recent price drops in the cryptocurrency market, including bitcoin, some investors seem interested in potential purchasing opportunities, reflected by increased searches for “buy the dip crypto.”
*   On-chain metrics like the MVRV ratio and shifts in open interest suggest a potential turnaround, indicating it might be a good time to invest in the primary digital asset.

Viewing the Crypto Crash as a Buying Opportunity
------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency sector has been in a state of severe correction in the past few weeks, with the situation intensifying today (May 1).

The global crypto market capitalization plunged to approximately $2.2 billion, while bitcoin’s price [tumbled](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) below $57,000 (per CoinGecko’s data) for the first time since late February. Popular altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have performed even worse, witnessing double-digit declines on a daily scale.

However, one important indicator hints that some investors remain unfazed, viewing the current grim reality as a great chance to enter the crypto ecosystem at a discount. According to Google Trends, searches for the phrase “buy the dip crypto” [spiked](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en) [](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en)to a level unseen since May 2022. The overall sentiment in the crypto market has turned neutral for the first time in three months, which it spent in “greedy” territory. This could be another sign that the market is done cooling off as participants’ greed has been reduced. After all, people should be “fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful,” as stated by Warren Buffett.

Optimistic Metrics for Bitcoin (BTC) Amid the Crash
---------------------------------------------------

As _CryptoPotato_ recently [reported](https://cryptopotato.com/these-metrics-suggest-it-is-time-to-buy-bitcoin-amid-btcs-price-drop-bitfinex/), several on-chain metrics signal that hopping on the BTC bandwagon at the moment might be the right choice. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator, which has been experiencing a downfall since the beginning of April, is one example.

A score above 3.5 hints that the Bitcoin price is close to its peak, whereas a result below one warns about a bottom. The MVRV ratio dipped to 2.21 at the end of February, flashing the buy signal for the leading digital asset.

Another major metric is the open interest (OI) weighted funding rate, which experienced a positive shift on April 24. According to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, the move shows rising interest in long BTC positions and a change in market sentiment from bearish to bullish.

Last but not least, we will touch upon the Bitcoin exchange netflow. The indicator has been predominantly negative in the past week, [pinpointing](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-netflow-total?exchange=spot_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=column) a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

URL Source: https://u.today/vitalik-buterin-reveals-surprising-crypto-security-practice

Published Time: 2024-05-01T11:26:00+0000

Markdown Content:
[Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) recently shared some insightful tips on securing [cryptocurrency](https://u.today/dogecoin-doge-founder-comments-on-crypto-market-crash) holdings, highlighting unconventional but highly effective methods. While hardware wallets are widely recommended for their robust security, Buterin points out the risks they carry, notably due to human error. Common pitfalls include misplacing the recovery seed, hiding it so well that it is eventually forgotten, or unforeseen situations like needing to move, leaving the seed in a bank safety deposit box.

To counteract these risks, Buterin adopts a sophisticated approach known as multisignature for over 90% of his personal funds. This method is not just about diversifying security measures — it is about decentralizing them. In a multisig setup, a transaction requires the approval of multiple, separately held keys to proceed, which significantly mitigates the risk of loss or theft.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds 🙂
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Buterin recommends an M-of-N scheme, where "M" represents the minimum number of approvals needed from a total of "N" possible keys. Importantly, not all keys are held by one person, and the identity of the holders is kept confidential, even from each other.

This technique enhances security by not relying on a single point of failure. If one key is compromised, the funds remain secure as long as the other required keys are safe. However, it does depend on the trustworthiness and reliability of those who hold the other keys.

[Buterin](https://u.today/vitalik-buterin-delivers-sobering-verdict-on-proof-of-work-ethereum) also critiqued the Shamir Backup, another method that splits a seed into multiple parts. While it sounds secure, Buterin argues that it is easier to mishandle compared to a multisig setup. The complexity and risk of error in reassembling the seed parts can outweigh its security benefits.

One way or another, if you are willing to feel safe when using digital assets, avoid some red flags like storing large amounts of cryptocurrency on exchanges, in decentralized applications or a custodial crypto storing service.

*   **Saylor’s strategic stock sales capitalize on MicroStrategy’s soaring value, showcasing astute financial planning.**
*   **Bitcoin’s volatility spotlights the evolving dynamics between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets.**
*   **MicroStrategy’s premium over Bitcoin raises questions about investor sentiment versus fundamentals.**

[Reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSTR:US) assert that MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and co-founder, Michael Saylor, has devised a brilliant financial scheme that involves leveraging [Bitcoin](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-market-sees-sell-off-before-fomc-meeting/) investments to transform a $1 income into a whopping $400 million profit. Saylor’s planned buying binge of 2020 has proven to be incredibly beneficial, yielding significant gains for both the company and himself.

Saylor’s astute maneuvering involves the pre-planned daily sales of MicroStrategy shares, totaling approximately 5,000 shares. These sales, stemming from options granted in 2014, coincide with MicroStrategy’s stock surge, which has doubled this year, hitting an all-time high of $1,195. This surge has outpaced even Bitcoin’s record gains, reflecting investors’ confidence in Saylor’s leadership and MicroStrategy’s trajectory.

Investors were concerned that Saylor may sell at the peak, but the performance of MicroStrategy’s stock has calmed their concerns. Saylor has a sizable stake in MicroStrategy, which is evidence of his unshakable commitment to the company’s long-term success.

Nonetheless, the investment world has expressed dismay over MicroStrategy’s premium over Bitcoin since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ([ETFs](https://coinedition.com/chinaamcs-bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-excel-iop-totals-142-million/)). Some analysts, including TD Cowen’s Lance Vitanza, contend that investors’ viewpoints may be obscured by media attention, highlighting Saylor’s decision to hold onto MicroStrategy’s stock.

Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wonders why investors would pay a premium for MicroStrategy’s stock when there are easily accessible Bitcoin ETFs. His comparison of MicroStrategy’s stock to a “retail magical believing stock” suggests that the company’s valuation may be more influenced by sentiment than by fundamentals.

Acquired as a hedge against inflation, MicroStrategy now has more than $13.5 billion in Bitcoin assets. Still, despite the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin, the company lost $53 million in the first quarter of operations. This loss, which is the outcome of accounting standards, emphasizes the difficulties involved in valuing digital assets on financial accounts.

Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer of Arca, sums up Saylor’s strategy for MicroStrategy this way: employing loan or equity to buy Bitcoin, which increases MicroStrategy’s stock price and permits future acquisitions.

With Bitcoin, which is currently trading [$56,959.62](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) with a decrease of 8.62% in the last 24 hours, its price volatility has brought attention to MicroStrategy’s investment method and the ways that the relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets is changing.

*   **Pike Finance has suffered a second attack in three days.**
*   **The first attack happened on April 26.**
*   **Both attacks are related to the same vulnerability.**

Pike Finance has suffered a second exploit in under a week, losing over a million in assorted cryptos across the [Ethereum](https://dailycoin.com/ethereum-eth/), Arbitrum, and Optimism chains.

The Circle-backed [decentralized finance](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-defi-mysteries-of-decentralized-finance/) (DeFi) protocol suffered the first attack on April 26, two days after it enabled USDC withdrawals via the CCTP protocol. Acknowledging that it lost 299,127 USDC in the aftermath, Pike Finance said the attack was due to a “USDC withdrawal vulnerability.”

**Hackers Exploit ‘USDC Vulnerability’ for the Second Time**
------------------------------------------------------------

On May 1, Pike Finance [alerted](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) the X (Twitter) crypto community to the second attack, noting that “this exploit is related to the initial USDC vulnerability reported last week on the 26th of April.”

Per the alert, Pike Finance upgraded the spoke contracts and included an additional dependency within the smart contract code to pause the protocol following the first exploit. The dependency introduced new variables, resulting in the position occupied by the \*initialized\* variable being taken by other variables.

The protocol said this led to a “misalignment in storage mapping.”

“This misalignment caused the contract to behave as if it was uninitialized, since the \*initialized\* variable could no longer be accessed. As a result, attackers were then able to upgrade the spoke contracts, bypassing admin access, and as a result, withdraw funds,” the protocol wrote.

The exploit resulted in the theft of over $1.6 million cryptos, including 99,970.48 ARB, 64,126 OP, and 479.39 ETH. Pike Finance offered a 20% reward for the return of the funds as it pursues an investigation.

Suspect stole 40,000 STRK tokens before cashing out to USDT
-----------------------------------------------------------

Chinese authorities have apprehended a suspect, identified as Lan Mou, for alleged identity forgery related to the StarkNet (STRK) airdrop. The suspect was arrested in the Guangdong Province on April 25, along with a computer and two mobile phones.

According to an April 30 [local media report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572), Lan Mou assumed other people’s identities and submitted over 40 false Early Community Member Program (ECMP) airdrop forms, claiming more than 40,000 STRK tokens that initially belonged to the victims. Following the airdrop, the suspect transferred the stolen STRK tokens to an OKX wallet and converted them to over $91,000 worth of Tether (USDT).

While scams and phishing attacks are common in the cryptocurrency space, identity theft on such a large scale for claiming other users’ airdrops appears to be an unprecedented occurrence.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The [StarkNet Foundation](https://cryptobriefing.com/starknet-foundation-confirms-1-8-billion-strk-token-rollout/), the organization supporting the Ethereum layer-2 Starknet network, launched a 700 million STRK token airdrop on Feb. 20 to reward Ethereum solo and liquid stakers, Starknet developers and users, as well as projects and developers outside the Web3 ecosystem. The airdrop generated significant interest, with the first 45 million STRK tokens being claimed in less than 90 minutes.

However, the STRK airdrop was not without controversy. On Feb. 20, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg warned that the StarkNet’s eligibility list primarily included airdrop squatters, or professional airdrop hunters, who only farm protocols with an incoming airdrop in hopes of financial gains.

Banteg alleged that approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop squatters seeking to compound their rewards.

This incident is not the first time airdrop hunters have exploited token distributions. In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from the [Arbitrum](https://cryptobriefing.com/arbitrum-atlas-upgrade/) (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets under their control.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-arrest-individual-for-starknet-airdrop-fraud/

Markdown Content:
In Guangdong province, China’s authorities have arrested a person who manipulated the process of identity verification to claim StarkNet (STRK) airdrop rewards illegally. 

The suspect, Lan Mou, employed false identities to enroll in StarkNet’s Early Community Member Program (ECMP) more than forty times and illegally collected over 40,000 STRK tokens, according to a [local report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572).

Subsequently, these tokens were moved to an OKX wallet and changed to Tether for an aggregate sum exceeding $91,000. The arrest was made on April 25, and a computer and two mobile phones supposedly employed in the scheme were taken by the police.

StarkNet’s Airdrop and Eligibility Issues
-----------------------------------------

StarkNet, an [Ethereum](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/ethereum-eth/) layer-2 scaling solution, [started an airdrop of 700 million](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/starknet-fixes-immutable-ethereum-stakers/) STRK tokens on February 20 towards Ethereum stakers, developers, and other contributors within the Web3 space. The project sought to recognize the active part of the community and to strengthen the network development. However, the distribution was fraught with several obstacles as it became interesting to airdrop squatters—people who create many accounts to claim a huge amount of tokens. Banteg, a developer from Yearn.Finance pointed out these problems a few days after the airdrop, including the fact that many of the 1.3 million eligible addresses are associated with suspicious Github profiles.

Precedents of Airdrop Misuse
----------------------------

The misuse of airdrops has been around in the cryptocurrency industry for quite some time. [In March](https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1639165562663358466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), the same tactics were seen in the case of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop. The airdrop hunters moved tokens of value $3.3 million from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets. Such events represent persisting weaknesses in digital token airdrops in the areas of identity verification and the prevention of fraudulent claims.

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/resources/spacey-game-guide-7-tips-earn-more-bitcoin-ios-android

If you're looking to bank a little bit of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) while playing fun mobile games, there are loads of free [play-to-earn iOS and Android games](https://decrypt.co/205392/bitcoin-booming-you-earn-more-playing-free-games) that pay satoshis (1/100,000,000 BTC) while you play and view ads. Not all of them are worth the hassle, but we’ve [recommended some that we like](https://decrypt.co/226248/play-games-earn-bitcoin-best-ios-android-games-pay-btc).

One of them is [SpaceY](https://decrypt.co/222699/earn-bitcoin-asteroid-mining-game), an amusing asteroid-mining game from Fumb Games that pays out Bitcoin as you skip across the galaxy to harvest resources. It’s simple and straightforward, but there’s a bit of strategy in the mix—ways to boost your earnings by taking advantage of every opportunity that pops up along the way.

Unlike Fumb’s own [Bitcoin Miner](https://decrypt.co/224183/you-can-earn-real-bitcoin-playing-crypto-mining-game-how-much), SpaceY doesn’t provide as many direct opportunities to earn more Bitcoin. But if you play smart, you’ll be able to stack up more satoshis without spending any real money. Here are seven tips to help you do just that.

**Tap those satoshis**
----------------------

This is the easiest tip on the list. Every so often, while mining an asteroid, an alert will flash on the screen, and an orange satoshi icon will slowly float along the path between your mining outposts and your space cruiser. You’ll typically have several seconds or more to claim it, so just tap the icon and grab that satoshi.

It might be worth a fraction of a penny’s worth of Bitcoin, but hey, those satoshis add up over time—a lot of time.

![Image 1: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips1.png@webp)

**Upgrade your ships**
----------------------

You’ll earn in-game coins for opening the game each day, for mining asteroids, for randomized events that pop up along the way, and for completing other tasks. Those coins will pile up, but there’s really no reason to sit on them. Instead, use them to upgrade your mining outposts. That will enable your outposts to mine asteroids faster, and each mined asteroid earns you a single satoshi. In other words, better outposts equals more Bitcoin earnings.

There’s a little bit of strategy to consider here. If you’re actively playing a lot—that is, keeping the game on your screen and playing for more than a moment at a time—then you might want a balanced fleet of mining outposts that all pull resources from asteroids at roughly the same rate. But if you’re someone who will hop in and play for a minute and then come back later, then you may just want to focus on upgrading one or two outposts and making them super efficient.

[You Can Earn Bitcoin for Playing This Asteroid Mining Game—Here's How Much](https://decrypt.co/222699/earn-bitcoin-asteroid-mining-game)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asteroid mining could be big business in the future, if anyone figures out how to make it economically feasible. For now, at least, you can mine Bitcoin from digital space rocks in the mobile game SpaceY. And yes, you really can cash out the BTC that you earn. SpaceY—no, not SpaceX— is a simple, straightforward idle mining game in which you’ll guide the adventures of a crew aboard a space freighter as it hops across the galaxy, looking for Bitcoin, and sucking dry whatever resources you can find...

**Claim the daily reward**
--------------------------

Playing daily is the best way to maintain earning momentum in SpaceY, as there’s a daily login reward—and the rewards get better with each consecutive day you play. While you won’t directly get any free Bitcoin from these rewards, you can get a huge stash of in-game coins, purple “credits” that you can use to buy coins and other boosts, as well as boxes that contain powerful augments to improve your mining outposts. These will all help you earn more BTC.

![Image 2: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips2.png@webp)

Screenshots from SpaceY. Image: Decrypt

**Use your augments**
---------------------

Augments are upgrades that can supercharge your mining outposts, improving their mining speed and efficiency along with other stats. And there are multiple levels of augments, ranging from a puny 2% improvement to a massive 1,000% boost. Make sure that you not only use the augments you have to improve your ships but also actively try to gain more.

You can unlock more augments by spending the purple credits you amass over time to buy boxes of augments in the shop. You can also trade up multiple lesser augments to unlock more powerful ones. The advantages can be huge, so don’t overlook this feature.

[Play Games, Earn Bitcoin: The Best iOS and Android Games That Pay You BTC](https://decrypt.co/226248/play-games-earn-bitcoin-best-ios-android-games-pay-btc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that there are mobile games that pay real Bitcoin for playing? These are legit games that you can download from the iOS App Store or Android Play Store, and as you play the game and watch ads between rounds or levels, you’ll stack up satoshis (aka the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin). Granted, you’ll need to keep your expectations in check—most of these games pay out something in the ballpark of a few cents worth of Bitcoin per hour of play. Nobody’s going to get rich playing a B...

**Pursue the alerts**
---------------------

Every so often, a red “alert” button will flash on the screen. Tapping that reveals some sort of story prompt—for example, a civilian ship is being attacked by raiders, or you’ve encountered a cluster of asteroids and meteors that could be mined. Take ‘em or leave ‘em.

Sometimes you’ll earn rewards from engaging with these—such as coins or augments. Sometimes you won’t earn anything. But there’s no apparent downside to engaging with these pop-up prompts. Even if the text says that the attempt went awry or that ships were destroyed in the process, we’ve never seen any tangible downside represented in the game. So even if they’re random and repetitive, you might as well engage with them and hope for rewards.

[You Can Earn Real Bitcoin for Playing This Crypto Mining Game—Here's How Much](https://decrypt.co/224183/you-can-earn-real-bitcoin-playing-crypto-mining-game-how-much)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve covered a lot of mobile games that pay players Bitcoin rewards, but Bitcoin Miner is the most literal interpretation we’ve seen to date: You’re mining fake cryptocurrency in this iOS and Android game, but can cash out real Bitcoin. As Decrypt’s GG recently reported, Bitcoin Miner first launched several years ago without real BTC earnings baked in, and it went nowhere. But once Fumb Games tried implementing the ability to earn and cash out satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,00...

**Watch the ads**
-----------------

Unlike in [Bitcoin Miner](https://decrypt.co/resources/bitcoin-miner-game-guide-earn-more-btc-ios-android), the ads in SpaceY are entirely optional—at least as of this writing. That’s much different than most of these play-to-earn Bitcoin games. But as with most free-to-play mobile games, there are real advantages to watching the video ads. And if you can stomach them, then you can make some serious progress here by watching them.

Why watch the video ads in SpaceY? Doing so can supercharge a boost that speeds up your mining capabilities, for example, or double the rewards you earn when logging in. Sometimes, watching an ad will also earn you VIP points, which can be spent to buy larger-scale game upgrades—such as boosting the number of coins earned while you’re offline, or extending how long the “x2 Speed” perks last.

![Image 3: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips3.png@webp)

Screenshots from SpaceY. Image: Decrypt

**Start over—no, really!**
--------------------------

This might not seem logical, but SpaceY gives you the option to essentially start the game over and go back to the first sector, keeping _some_ of the benefits you’ve amassed on your journey while significantly boosting your in-game coin earnings. It’s called a “Temporal Jump,” and is akin to a “New Game+” mode in some video games.

While it’s true that you’ll have to start the quest over again and replay past sectors, the truth is that every sector in the game (that we’ve played, at least) is more or less the same, aside from minor variables. You’re probably not going to be playing this game to explore the galaxy; you’re playing it because it’s a simple, fun diversion that pays you a bit of Bitcoin along the way. You’ll earn Bitcoin faster by triggering this Temporal Jump every so often.

*   **Ver’s journey reflects the tension between principles of decentralization and personal gain.**
*   **His involvement with Ripple and Bitcoin Cash sparked regulatory challenges and community discord.**
*   **The debate over Ver’s legacy underscores the complexities of navigating ideology and self-interest in crypto.**

Among the wild history of Bitcoin, there are few figures who had provoked as many debates and controversies as Roger Ver. David “JoelKatz” Schwartz, CTO at Ripple, has pointed that both he was both acclaim and censure. . 

From his early days as a vocal supporter bitcoins to the later controversies with Ripple and Bitcoin Cash, his journeys mirror the complexities and conflicts that lie in the journey of Digital currencies.

&gt; I happen to run into a bitcoin OG just a few weeks ago and we started talking about Roger Ver. I won't mention who, but they can out themselves in this thread if they want to.
&gt; 
&gt; I shared two things about Roger. He's one of the nicest and most genuine people I've ever met. And he…
&gt; 
&gt; — David "JoelKatz" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1785526223546007949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Ver’s backers describe him as a skilled visionary businessman and resolute protector of personal freedoms. They praise his early advocacy for Bitcoin, indicating that he was instrumental in its adoption, and his clear principles of decentralization and personal sovereignty.However, the critics draw a different picture, holding him responsible for promotion of divisive agendas and engaging in questionable practices which are breeding the unnecessary fractures within the community.

Central to the debate surrounding Ver is the perception of his moral compass and ethical conduct. Others hail him as a principled custodian of economic liberty, while others go to the extent of [criticizing](https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1785532239700517157) him as one who puts individual interest above those of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This contradiction therefore emphasizes the complexities of the intersection of ideology, self-interest, and the quest for technological innovations in the digital era.

One recurring point of contention is Ver’s involvement with Ripple, a venture that has drawn scrutiny from regulators and industry observers alike. While Ver’s support for Ripple may have been rooted in a genuine belief in its potential to revolutionize financial systems, critics argue that his association with the project contributed to early regulatory challenges for Bitcoin and fueled perceptions of opportunism.

In addition to that, Ver’s active participation in the contentious fork that resulted in the emergence of Bitcoin Cash has widened the gaps within the community. While some consider Bitcoin Cash as a real alternative with its own distinct value proposition, others see it as a ploy to seize control of the brand for [personal gains](https://x.com/topcointrader/status/1785530654102352187).The debate over Ver’s motivations and intentions continues to shape narratives surrounding his legacy within the cryptocurrency sphere.

**What Happened**: In a statement [shared](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?s=46) on the social platform X, Zhao thanked his supporters, saying, “I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong.”

The sentencing occurred in Seattle on Tuesday, where Zhao also agreed to a $50 million fine as part of his plea deal. Despite the setbacks, Zhao is turning his focus to education, initiating a project named **Giggle Academy**.

He stated, “I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important.”

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a significant drop, falling to $56,556 during Wednesday morning in Europe, marking the lowest point since late February. This downturn represents the sharpest monthly decline since November 2022, with BTC tumbling approximately 7.5% within the last 24 hours and breaching the previously stable $60,000 support late Tuesday.

#1 Derisking Before Today’s FOMC Meeting
----------------------------------------

Anticipation and anxiety are high in financial circles as the [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/) is set to announce its interest rate decision later today. This event is crucial as the crypto market, notably Bitcoin, has grown increasingly reactive to macroeconomic signals.

Recent data, reflecting a slowdown in GDP growth coupled with persistent inflation, has significantly reduced expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. “Bitcoin and other risk assets are currently feeling the pressure from a stagflationary environment, geopolitical tensions, and seasonal liquidity variations,” [remarked](https://talkingmacro.com/research/may-fomc-meeting-preview-2024-05-01) Ted from TalkingMacro.

Initially, up to seven rate cuts were anticipated by the end of 2024, a sentiment that has shifted dramatically with the market now pricing in only one potential cut by December 2024. This shift comes amidst an environment where inflation data is trending upwards, challenging the Federal Reserve’s position and potentially leading to a more cautious approach from Jerome Powell, the Fed Chairman.

“For the first time in recent memory, the market is calling the Fed’s bluff, quickly front-running the idea that the Fed may not cut at all in 2024,” noted Ted.

### #2 Cyclical Bitcoin Correction Phase

Following an exceptional rally since the year’s start, the market is undergoing a natural correction phase. Prior to the price crash, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, [noted](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/if-history-rhymes-bitcoin-price-next-6-months/): “We are a day short of breaking the record set in 2011 for days without a meaningful dip \[-25%\],” emphasizing the extraordinary nature of Bitcoin’s recent performance. [![Image 3: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=898067)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1897421&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=378944&amp;banID=519875620&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1827585&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714567974762437&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons%2F&amp;hc=4ca35a1e32b658464542fc6104ec9a6e31812059&amp;location=)

Scott Melker, known as “The Wolf Of All Streets,” highlighted technical indicators that suggested an impending correction. “Broke and retested range lows as resistance. \[…\] My biggest concern I have been discussing for months \[was\] that RSI never made the trip to oversold. Almost there now, all lower time frames oversold. This is still ONLY A 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.” &gt; [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Daily

### #3 Profit-Taking

Traditional finance markets and seasoned investors are seizing the opportunity to take profits following substantial gains. “TradFi/Boomers are taking profits: [CME Open Interest](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/cme-overtakes-binance-in-bitcoin-futures-crypto-investments/) is decreasing rapidly, April 29th 135,6k coins, April 30th 123,9k coins, topped around 170.4k coins (March 20th),” explained crypto analyst RunnerXBT.

[![Image 4: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374570&amp;setID=452519&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293220&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714567974999843&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons%2F&amp;hc=3f52ad1e25eead94acc7d3498f79cf6ca28b44cc&amp;location=)

This trend confirms a broader profit-taking strategy post significant events like the ETF approval and the anticipation around the [Bitcoin halving](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/). “That \[…\] confirms my thesis that a lot of these guys longed in October 2023 because of ETF approval and BTC halving, trade played out and now they are taking profits (yes they are still up a lot), because they longed BTC not dead altcoins.” &gt; TradFi/Boomers are taking profits ✅ &gt; &gt; CME Open Interest is decreasing rapidly &gt; April 29th 135,6k coins &gt; April 30th 123,9k coins &gt; &gt; Topped around 170.4k coins (March 20th) &gt; &gt; That at least for me confirms my thesis that a lot of these guys longed in October 2023 because of ETF approval… [pic.twitter.com/M8KY1NfCtK](https://t.co/M8KY1NfCtK)

### #4 US ETF Flows And Hong Kong Disappointment

The dynamics surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs have shown significant strains, evidenced by recent activities in both US and Hong Kong markets. In the United States, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced substantial outflows, indicating a cooling investor sentiment.

According to recent [data](https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1785534412383224038), the total outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $161.6 million. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced outflows of $93.2 million, while Fidelity and Bitwise registered outflows of $35.3 million and $34.3 million, respectively. BlackRock had zero net flows once again. These numbers suggest a retreat in institutional interest, which has traditionally been a bulwark against price volatility.

Parallel to the US, the debut of [Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/spot-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-approved-hong-kong/) also faltered significantly below expectations. Six newly launched ETFs, intended to capture both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, collectively reached just $11 million in trading volume, starkly underperforming against the anticipated $100 million. The spot Bitcoin ETFs accounted for $8.5 million in trading volume. This was markedly lower than the launch day volumes of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had reached $655 million on their first day.

### #5 Long Liquidations

The market has also been impacted by substantial long liquidations, with a total of $451.28 million liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. The largest single liquidation was an ETH-USDT-SWAP on OKX valued at $6.07 million, but Bitcoin-specific liquidations were significant as well, totaling $143.04 million, according to [data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from CoinGlass. These liquidations have amplified the selling pressure on Bitcoin.

At press time, BTC traded at $57,715.

Crypto market sinks ahead of Fed decision on interest rates
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the lead-up to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, investor pessimism has significantly impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

As of the time of writing, BTC has dropped 7.6%, and ETH is down 6% over the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin price is currently hovering around $57,000, while the Ethereum price is stuck at just under $2,900, according to data from CoinGecko.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The volatility has been particularly challenging for derivatives traders, with $457 million worth of crypto futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. Unsurprisingly, $392 million of those liquidations were long contracts, where traders had placed bets on future price increases.

The sagging prices have been widespread throughout the market, with few assets in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinGecko escaping the sea of red, aside from stablecoins that have managed to maintain their pegs, such as [Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC](https://cryptobriefing.com/usdc-overtakes-usdt-transaction-volume/).

The US Federal Open Markets Committee is set to publish its interest [rate decision](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) at 2 PM (Eastern Time) today, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 PM. In February, investors seemed certain that May would be the month the [FOMC finally cut interest rates](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-faces-key-resistance-fomc-meeting/), which is typically a bullish sign for risk assets like Bitcoin. Lower interest rates usually encourage traders to move out of US Treasuries and chase gains in riskier assets, such as equities and crypto assets.

However, the Fed’s key interest rate currently stands at a high of 5.25% to 5.5% and has been unchanged since July 2023 as the central bank aims to curb inflation. Policymakers have been closely monitoring inflation, which is currently at 3.5%, hoping to bring it closer to 2% before considering rate reductions. Last month, inflation increased to its highest level since September, making the prospect of rate cuts more distant.

In March, the Swiss Central Bank announced it was cutting interest rates, providing some hope for traders. However, this sentiment hasn’t spread to other major central banks. Months prior, traders [seemed certain](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-fomc-market-watch/) that the Fed might lower interest rates in June, according to the [CME Fed Watch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). Sentiment has since soured, with more expectation surrounding the Fed not easing out interest rates until at least the end of this year.

**Santiment** [data](https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1785183439286882449) suggests that traders should watch for a spike in volume as a potential turnaround signal for a market-wide rally heading into May. However, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped by 60%-65% since its peak in late February.

**InvestAnswers**, a popular trader, [pointed out](https://twitter.com/invest_answers/status/1785605068030660824) that despite the drop and massive ETF selling, a whale accumulated 1,200 BTC worth $68 million, which is three times the daily issuance. The trader also noted that a typical bull run has two 20-30% dips, and the current 23% retrace from all-time high levels is not unusual.

IntoTheBlock data highlights that transactions greater than 100,000 surged from 8,519 on April 29 to 11,160 on April 30, with large transaction volumes widening by 21.3% to 57.4 billion.

**Analyst Notes:** Technical analyst C**rypto Con** noted they are patiently waiting for Bitcoin to retest its 20-week EMA, now at $57,137, as the last retest was in January 2023. They point out that it is "good for price to revisit this moving average every few months so it is not parabolic" and that 2015 to 2017 saw eight such retests.

**Rekt Capital** [sees](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785590508288389203) this drop as "officially the deepest retrace in the cycle (-23.6%)." Another crypto trader, **Captain Faibik**, [sees](https://twitter.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1785512569546920310) Bitcoin moving inside the Bullish Flag Pattern while the daily RSI is below the multi-month trendline.

**Recent data highlights a significant downturn in the open interest of major cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), [Solana](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/) ([SOL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/)), and Ripple (XRP).**

With a combined drop of 51%, these altcoins spark debate over the implications for their future market positions.

Open Interest Declines Across the Crypto Market
-----------------------------------------------

Open interest, a crucial indicator of market sentiment and liquidity, reflects the total value of outstanding [futures](https://beincrypto.com/learn/cryptocurrency-futures-where-to-trade-them/) contracts yet settled. For cryptocurrencies, these metrics provide insights into investor behavior and market dynamics.

Dogecoin led the recent decline, with its open interest plummeting by 64% to $668.2 million since the start of April. Solana and XRP also witnessed considerable reductions, decreasing by 47% to $1.51 billion and 44% to $497.67 million, respectively.

This widespread decline compate with the open interest levels of Bitcoin, which has dropped to those observed during the FTX collapse, further intensifying concerns about the broader state of the crypto market.

&gt; “The Open Interest Oscillator has cooled down significantly from the peak of 73K, currently at -15%. Normally, a rally starts from the lower bounds, but in our case, it is hindered by the pressure from bearish market orders.” Axel, a verified analyst from CryptoQuant, [stated](https://twitter.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1785555494133735769).

The sharp drop in Dogecoin’s open interest suggests a pullback in trading activity and potentially diminished investor confidence. This is corroborated by Dogecoin’s market performance, where it continues to trade near the lower end of its short-term range.

Such trends often signal consolidation phases, which could precede further losses unless there is a significant uptick in buyer engagement.

Solana’s situation reveals similar challenges. Apart from its falling open interest, the network saw a drastic 95% decrease in its monthly transaction volume, falling to $7.32 trillion in April from much higher levels in March. The declining network activity and bearish technical patterns suggest that [Solana may struggle](https://beincrypto.com/sol-death-cross-decline/) to regain its previous highs.

XRP’s open interest scenario is slightly different, given [the recent whale activity](https://beincrypto.com/xrp-whales-initiating-recovery/) involving the transfer of 29 million XRP tokens from Bitstamp to an undisclosed [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/). While such movements have historically been precursors to price surges, reliance on a single event for market prediction is precarious.

Moreover, the ongoing legal tussle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission over XRP’s status as a [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) continues to loom over its market prospects, casting uncertainty on its potential recovery.

Despite these challenges, the possibility of a sudden reversal exists, particularly for XRP. Reduced leveraged positions might hint at short-term selling pressure. Still, the dominance of perpetual contracts in its open interest composition allows room for swift price changes if buying activity resumes.

The excitement surrounding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suffered a significant setback in April, coinciding with the decline in the cryptocurrency's price. New U.S. ETFs experienced net outflows of $343.5 million, ending a streak of three-month inflows.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness $344 Million Net Withdrawals in April
---------------------------------------------------------------

ETFs had previously experienced significant inflows, attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion and $4.6 billion in demand in January, February and March, respectively.

However, overall flows have slowed significantly since peaking at $1.05 billion in daily net inflows on March 12.

This slowdown was accompanied by an 18% decline in Bitcoin's value, which fell from its all-time high of $73,650 on March 14 by the end of April.

April's outflows were led by Grayscale's high-fee GBTC fund, which saw $2.5 billion in outflows during the month. Ark Invest's ARKB experienced monthly net outflows of $86.3 million, while Valkyrie's BRRR also recorded small net outflows of $0.3 million.

Although Fidelity's FBTC and Bitwise's BITB also saw their first daily outflows in April, the remaining funds recorded net inflows last month.

BlackRock's IBIT continued to dominate net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, taking in $1.5 billion through April.

This was followed by $556.1 million for Fidelity's FBTC and $125 million for Bitwise's BITB. However, the 71-day inflow streak that propelled IBIT into the top ten ETFs of all time ended on April 23. Since then, the fund has seen zero flows for five consecutive days.

Ark Invest's ARKB was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to record net inflows on Tuesday, adding $3.6 million.

Meanwhile, outflows from Grayscale's GBTC ($93.2 million), Fidelity's FBTC ($35.3 million) and Bitwise's BITB ($34.3 million) were at 161,000 for the day. It contributed to a net outflow of $6 million.

Total net inflows into the combined US spot Bitcoin ETFs were $11.8 billion, falling below $12 billion since trading began Jan. 11.

Daily trading volume for ETFs has also fallen significantly after hitting a record $9.9 billion on March 5, when Bitcoin surpassed its previous cycle peak of around $69,000 for the first time. The trading volume recorded on Tuesday was $2.9 billion.

Federal Judge Sentences Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao to Jail
--------------------------------------------------------------

Binance's founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao is sentenced to four months in jail by Federal Judge Richard Jones in the Western District Court of Washington. It's worth noting that the judge imposed this sentence for violating American money laundering laws.   

However, the prosecution had recommended a three-year sentence for CZ for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at the [crypto exchange](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-joins-hands-with-bouncebit-a-btc-restaking-chain"cryptoexchange"). Yet, in court, Judge Jones stated that there was no evidence that Changpeng Zhao was ever informed about any illicit activities taking place at Binance. Thus, dismissing the prosecutor's request to extend CZ's sentence to three years from the initial 18 months.

The prosecution argued that a jail sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense related to AML violations. Otherwise, it would only encourage further breaches of the law. Following this, CZ was sentenced to four months in jail.

### Changpeng Zhao Apologized Before Sentencing

Changpeng Zhao sought forgiveness for his actions, admitting that he had plenty of time to think and react. He acknowledged responsibility for [Binance's](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-is-back-in-india-after-paying-dollar2-million-fine"Binance's") failure to implement an effective AML program. It's noteworthy that after being sentenced to four months in jail, CZ stated that he would report to jail on the designated date. Currently, Changpeng Zhao is out on bail, amounting to $175 million, but with the court's decision to sentence him to four months in jail, he will be placed in police custody. This is where CZ will serve his jail term.

It's important to recall that on November 21, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was found guilty of failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws in his exchange. Consequently, he had to resign from his position as CEO of Binance. This settlement, part of the ongoing investigation into Binance by US regulators, involved a $4.3 billion payment made by Binance to resolve the probe.

In light of these developments, the cryptocurrency community is closely observing the implications of CZ's sentencing on Binance's operations and the broader crypto market. Some speculate that this could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny on other crypto exchanges and projects. Others are concerned about the impact on Binance's reputation and its ability to maintain its position as one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally.

#### Conclusion

According to Coin Gabbar, Changpeng Zhao's sentencing marks a significant event in the intersection of cryptocurrency and regulation. It underscores the importance of adhering to regulatory standards in the rapidly evolving crypto industry and the potential consequences for those who fail to do so. As the crypto market continues to mature, such legal actions are likely to become more common as regulators worldwide seek to ensure compliance and protect investors.

Efforts to push through [U.S. stablecoin legislation](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38431860/maxine-waters-says-stablecoin-bill-in-the-short-run-coming) by attaching it to an unrelated Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill have been halted by legislative leaders.

**What Happened**: The decision to seek a clean bill means the discussion between House Financial Services Committee Chair **Patrick McHenry** (R-N.C.) and Rep. **Maxine Waters** (D-Calif.) will revert to direct negotiations on a comprehensive agreement, the aide noted, preferring anonymity due to the private nature of the talks, Coindesk [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/stablecoin-bill-unlikely-to-get-pinned-to-faa-reauthorization-putting-effort-on-hold-again/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines).

This development underscores the seriousness of the legislative push for stablecoin oversight, with significant discussions involving key Senate members for the first time.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman **Sherrod Brown** (D-Ohio) has expressed willingness to combine stablecoin regulations with legislation facilitating financial services for the cannabis industry.

However, Senate Majority Leader **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.) supports this plan, while Minority Leader **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.) remains opposed.

The scenario suggests that stablecoin regulation may resurface in other crucial legislative processes, potentially linked with cannabis banking reforms.

“This push will demonstrate the level of Congressional support for these measures and identify the opposition,” **Jaret Seiberg**, a TD Cowen analyst, commented in a research note.

He anticipates that the real legislative efforts will intensify later in the year.

Previously, an infrastructure bill unexpectedly carried significant crypto regulations, illustrating that the legislative vehicle for stablecoin and potentially cannabis banking reforms might also be unconventional.

Yet, a final compromise on the stablecoin legislation that satisfies all parties has not been reached, causing industry insiders to remain cautious.

**Kristin Smith**, CEO of the **Blockchain Association**, emphasized the importance of the legislative details.

“We look forward to reviewing and providing feedback on any new compromise drafts that might emerge,” she said.

With several lawmakers having strong motivations to advance a stablecoin bill, the outcome could significantly impact their political careers.

“Brown is particularly motivated to advance the SAFER Banking Act before his challenging re-election bid, aiming for a legislative win on the popular issue of cannabis reform,”

**Beacon Policy Advisors** noted in their analysis, also highlighting that this is a defining issue for the retiring McHenry.

**What’s Next:** This legislative drama unfolds as the digital assets industry continues to gain prominence, a topic that will undoubtedly be a point of discussion at Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19, where the future of regulations and their impact on the industry will be key themes.

**BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has become the world’s largest treasury fund tokenized on a blockchain.**

This achievement follows its surpassing of Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (BENJI) in market cap. The milestone highlights a pivotal moment in integrating digital asset management with traditional financial systems.

BlackRock’s BUIDL Achieves 36.5% Monthly Growth
-----------------------------------------------

[Launched merely six weeks ago](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-crypto-giant-tokenized-fund/), BUIDL quickly captured the market’s attention, amassing a market cap of $375 million. In contrast, the BENJI fund, previously the leader in this space, currently holds a market cap of $368 million.

According to on-chain analyst Tom Wan, in April, BUIDL’s value [surged](https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1785242220922065377) 36.5%, increasing from $274 million to $375 million. In contrast, BENJI’s growth was modest, rising just 2.1% from $360 million to $368 million during the same period. Moreover, [BUIDL’s recent surge included $95 million from Ondo Finance’s](https://beincrypto.com/ondo-finance-blackrock-tokenized-fund/) OUSG token.

Despite BENJI’s innovative approach, BlackRock’s BUIDL has swiftly ascended to the top, highlighting the rapid adoption and potential of blockchain within mainstream financial services.

[BlackRock CEO Larry Fink advocates for tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-larry-fink-bitcoin-ethereum-tokenization/) of real-world assets. He believes that on-chain implementations can bring more efficiency to capital markets. This sentiment resonates with the broader trend of asset [tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-tokenization/), which now extends beyond government securities to include stocks and real estate.

Although the general demand for these tokenized products remains in its nascent stages, specific segments, as exemplified by BUIDL, show promising interest. Wan points out that liquidity remains a primary concern for potential investors in tokenized equities, funds, or bonds.

&gt; “Even if the end investors are crypto natives, they would be reluctant to invest in tokenized equities given the thin liquidity. As a result, creates a chicken and egg problem. Issuers don’t see a clear benefit in tokenizing their assets on-chain with low-demand,” Wan said.

URL Source: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-deaton-sec-gensler-infected-agency/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T07:30:52-05:00

Markdown Content:
In a searing critique, John E. Deaton, a prominent legal advocate for XRP, has issued a forceful condemnation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, accusing him of undermining ethical standards and fostering an environment of deceit at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Deaton’s allegations emerged following a statement by Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, asserting that Gensler had misled Congress during his testimonies, particularly concerning the regulatory status of Ether as a security. McHenry’s statement reflects a broader concern about potential misrepresentations and obfuscations by the SEC which, according to him, indicate a pattern of “regulation by enforcement.”

Deaton Details Gensler’s ‘Bad Faith’
------------------------------------

In a [statement](https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1785392734527778824) on X, Deaton directed public attention to his [amicus brief in the Coinbase litigation](https://bitcoinist.com/john-deaton-backs-coinbase-in-with-amicus-brief/), emphasizing its significance in illustrating Gensler’s questionable regulatory practices. “With all due respect, it’s time to serve multiple subpoenas on Gary Gensler and the SEC. I encourage everyone to read the Amicus Brief I filed in the Coinbase case. There’s a section in the brief proving Gensler is a bad faith regulator who has infected the entire agency,” Deaton asserted.

The amicus brief itself details accusations against Gensler, presenting a narrative of an SEC that manipulates legal outcomes to fit its agenda, often at the expense of innovation and transparency. Deaton cites multiple instances where federal judges have criticized the SEC for its “win at all costs” approach.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714568181097619&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fxrp-deaton-sec-gensler-infected-agency%2F&amp;hc=1a0b29f713563c1daf60441f925ee5d0c616bd75&amp;location=)

For example, Judge Netburn in a related XRP lawsuit remarked on the SEC’s strategy, stating, “Shielding the Court from indisputable truths is a win at all costs strategy and another example of the SEC adopting its litigation positions to further its desired goal, and not out of a faithful allegiance to the law.”

The brief goes further, pointing to specific comments by SEC Commissioner [Hester Peirce](https://bitcoinist.com/sec-commissioner-crypto-regulation-enforcement/), who criticized her own agency’s approach to regulation. Peirce noted, “Inviting people to come in and talk to us only to drag them through a difficult, lengthy, unproductive, and labyrinthine regulatory process casts the Commission in a bad light and thus makes us a less effective regulator.”

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714568181159269&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fxrp-deaton-sec-gensler-infected-agency%2F&amp;hc=13f316b1883a97647185633e99973e502e89ee25&amp;location=)

Highlighting the legal and financial ramifications of the SEC’s actions, Deaton’s brief references the agency’s alleged threats to bankrupt companies through litigation—a claim supported by a declaration from the founder of [LBRY](https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-blasts-sec-millions-wasted/). “The SEC’s objective of bankrupting us through the process, which they threatened privately three years ago, they succeeded,” stated the founder, whose experience was documented in court filings.

Moreover, the brief critically examines Gensler’s previous statements, which Deaton argues are contradictory and demonstrate bad faith. Before his tenure at the SEC, Gensler expressed concerns about the lack of regulatory clarity in digital asset markets.

However, as chairman, he has asserted that “the rules related to crypto assets are well-settled” and that “the test to determine whether a crypto asset is a security is clear,” remarks made during his speech at the Aspen Security Forum on August 3, 2021.

These contradictions are at the heart of Deaton’s critique, suggesting a pattern of behavior at the SEC where the truth is less important than the regulatory outcomes the agency seeks to achieve. The brief warns that such behavior not only damages the SEC’s credibility but also has significant implications for the future of digital asset regulation in the US.

### XRP Lawyer Community Reacts

Meanwhile, other lawyers from the XRP community have criticized McHenry’s empty words. Marc Fagel, a retired securities lawyer [commented](https://twitter.com/Marc_Fagel/status/1785398868970217817), “C’mon, John. As a lawyer, you know McHenry’s statement is bogus. The SEC has made no legal determination as to ETH, and GG made no misrepresentations at the hearing. You can disagree with and disdain the guy, but be honest about it.”

Fred Rispoli, founder of HODL Law [stated](https://twitter.com/freddyriz/status/1785404503262715968) with regards to McHenry, “This line from your release is inaccurate and/or misleading: “Committee Republicans will continue to hold Gary Gensler’s SEC accountable for its regulatory overreach….”Respectfully, sir: How have you held it accountable in the first place? Genuinely want to know.”

At press time, XRP traded at $0.4881.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-this-the-end-of-bitcoins-bull-run-peter-schiff-thinks-so/

Markdown Content:
Well known for his gold-positive viewpoint, [Peter Schiff](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/schiff-on-bitcoins-stability-as-gold-soars/) recently again underlined his negative viewpoint on Bitcoin. He characterized Bitcoin as entering the “danger zone,” a critical time because it has been marked down below $60,000. Meanwhile, the $60,000 price level, which was considered a heavy psychological and technical barrier during the 2024 bull run, has proved to be a strong support level. Schiff’s forecast states that the breach of this point would result in the market changing its current up-trending pattern.

Today, [Bitcoin](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brandts-clashing-bitcoin-predictions-divide/)‘s value stands at $57,501. It tends to maintain proximity with the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). As per Schiff’s interpretation, failure to sustain a level above the EMA could unfold an adverse trend. The underlying force ends the current rally, which has been taking place over the last year. The scenario is still liquid as the upcoming trading is believed to be of great significance.

The flip side of the coin is that a price fall is usually accompanied by a rise in the volume of trades, which in turn indicates selling pressure has risen. This channel is generally thought to express a bearish trend. This is in line with Schiff’s concept that supply and demand dynamics change. The behavior of Bitcoin in these times is being traced closely, with a focus on whether the asset can recapture its $60,000 worth.

**Bitcoin nears key $51,965 support level**
-------------------------------------------

Since the recent drop, the market has begun to take a position on the downside of Bitcoin with increased caution. Traders are rightly sizing the fact that it is possible the price has more room to drop. On the technical side, failure to reach the $60,000 level soon can be a precursor to further fall. Support number two will be located at $51,965, which is the range lower. The stock reaching this level of selling price would be a significant decline from the recent levels and may promote further selling.

On the contrary, if Bitcoin rebounds from its current troughs, it must hit the resistance levels at $60k above it to nullify the bearish inclination. If it successfully moves beyond this barrier, it could lead to further exploration of zones as high as $64,000. Such a case would motivate investors who are bullish about Bitcoin.

Among analyst tools are market evaluation instruments. They must watch close changes in the volume and cost direction, as well as the EMA level. These metrics are used to forecast future shifts, and once they have been realized, traders will be able to make sensible decisions in these unpredictable circumstances.

**Potential implications for the crypto market**
------------------------------------------------

Being the bear on Bitcoin, he has accrued a number of followers in discussions about its overall effect on the cryptocurrency market. If, however, this is the case, BTC might drastically have a negative impact on the whole crypto industry. Market players are keeping a close watch on this, with price changes sometimes affecting others quite dramatically.

Volatility is the word which describes the current cryptocurrency conditions and brings new people in because of the chance to make larger profits. As of now, there is a high chance that you might lose the money you invest, so be extremely careful when taking this route. It is recommended that they don’t lose sight of market moves and catching the technical signals. This is indispensable in order to ensure a smooth operation over obstacles that might show up.

At the end, the Bitcoin crisis and its fall past US$60,000 have increased concerns regarding whether or not BTC will still go upwards in the future. His statements have stressed hazards that in turn have made traders think over safety measures before making any move. The upcoming weeks will be key in assessing whether Bitcoin’s price is going to jump or fall and, consequently, the state of the global cryptocurrency industry.

The closure of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank marks the inaugural banking failure in the United States for 2024.

This event has ignited discussions within the crypto community, with Bitcoin, Ether, and various altcoins experiencing slight setbacks in the wake of the news.

Macro Taking 'Wind' Out of Crypto: Starkiller's Drogen

[Zesh Marius Martocsan](https://zesh.io/marius-martocsan-building-a-web3-powerhouse/), CEO of X, expressed skepticism towards traditional banking, stating, “Another bank just collapsed, the Republic First Bank. Yeah… I think I’ll stick to Bitcoin.”

Pillage Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader on X, viewed the failure of Republic First Bank as a significant narrative for crypto, stating, “Republic First Bank failure is worth a look since bank failures are the best possible narrative we can get for crypto.”

Randi Hipper, a crypto commentator, posed a thought-provoking question to her 87,100 X followers, asking, “How many more need to fail before people start to be their own bank?”

Following the seizure of Republic First by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities on April 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as its receiver.

The FDIC will absorb nearly all deposits and assets of Republic Bank, as outlined in an April 26 statement by the agency.

As of January 31, Republic First possessed approximately $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits.

Subsequently, its 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York will reopen under the umbrella of Fulton Bank on April 27.

The news of Republic First Bank’s closure follows a challenging year for the banking industry, with FDIC data reporting five banking failures in the U.S. in 2023.

Furthermore, recent history has shown that even rumors of potential banking failures can impact Bitcoin’s price.

However, in this instance, Bitcoin is down 1.16% and trading at $62,715, while Ether is down 0.58% and trading at $3,095, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Altcoins have experienced a slightly more significant decline, with Dogecoin down 2.88% and Solana down 1.79% in the past hour.

In 2023, the closure of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, among others, underscored the challenges faced by the banking industry.

The collective value of cryptocurrency compromised by hacking plummeted by 67% in April to $60.2 million. This marks a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline this year.

The fall of 67% marks a sharp decline from the $187.6 million hacked in March, which pales in comparison to the $360.8 million worth of hacked digital assets in April, according to a May 1 X [post](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1785631890470572421/photo/1) by on-chain security firm Peckshield.

_Source:_ [_PeckShield_](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1785631890470572421/photo/1)

The monthly total of $60.2 million was stolen from 40 individual hacking incidents. Hacks and exploits have been among the main issues plaguing trust in cryptocurrencies along with mainstream adoption.

The [$44.7 million hack on Hedgey Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedgey-protocol-44-million-exploit), a token infrastructure platform, represented the largest incident in April. The hackers exploited a vulnerability in Hedgey’s token claim contract on the Arbitrum Network on April 19.

The second-largest hacking incident saw $3 million worth of crypto stolen from the Fixed Float crypto exchange due to a vulnerability with a third-party service provider used by the exchange, according to FixedFloat’s April 2 X [post](https://twitter.com/FixedFloat/status/1775172224216875223).

The third-largest attack, on Grand Base, netted hackers $2.67 million worth of digital assets, while the fourth-largest [hack, on Pike Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pike-finance-exploited-1-6-million-second-exploit-3-days), resulted in a loss of $1.6 million worth of funds.

Fueling investor concerns, the $1.6 million attack was the second hack suffered by Pike Finance within three days, after a $300,000 exploit on April 26.

The two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract, [according](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to a May 1 X post by Pike Finance.

Crypto hacks down over 25% year-to-date compared to 2023
--------------------------------------------------------

The crypto space saw a total of over $401 million worth of hacks and rug pulls in 2024 year-to-date (YTD), which represents a 25.1% decrease compared to the same period last year, which saw over $536 million worth of hacked funds, according to a May 1 [report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/2FlKal41QbUO206gQAcNOr/43ccdf6d0aed156a5d22320d7ab702bb/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_In_April_2024.pdf) by crypto bounty platform Immunefi.

According to Immunefi’s figures, $53 million was lost to hacks and fraud across 21 incidents in April, representing a 46% decrease from April 2023, when attackers stole over $98 million worth of digital assets.

Hacks remained the main cause of losses, accounting for over 94.3% of the lost funds during the month.

**As Bitcoin prices continue to face intense [volatility](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/) after the halving, the stability of the entire crypto-mining industry could hinge on a critical support level.** 

Currently trading around $57,000, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop from its March 14 all-time high of $73,750. This downturn places immense pressure on Bitcoin miners, who grapple with the effects of the latest halving event that reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.

Will Bitcoin Miners Capitulate Following the Halving?
-----------------------------------------------------

Despite these challenges, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently [highlighted](https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1785171733454143633) that [Bitcoin miners](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-miner-revenue-runes-post-halving/) have yet to show signs of capitulation. Typically, capitulation occurs when miners, unable to cover operational costs due to falling Bitcoin prices, are forced to sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down further. 

However, Ju’s analysis suggests miners hold onto their assets, betting on a future price recovery.

&gt; “Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped to levels seen in early 2023 following the halving. Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in BTC price. There are no signs of capitulation for now,” Ju said.

This optimism is echoed by some analysts who foresee a potential recovery. Following the previous halvings, [Bitcoin usually undergoes price fluctuations,](https://beincrypto.com/bullish-altcoins-outshine-bitcoin-may/) historically leading to rallies due to increased asset scarcity. This pattern suggests a possible price uplift, aligning with the miners’ decision to hold.

However, Charles Edwards, Founder of Capriole Investments, [believes](https://x.com/caprioleio/status/1782268940397236432) the recent downward price action could soon wreak havoc on Bitcoin miners. The electricity cost to operate the Bitcoin network is currently an astonishing $77,400 per BTC mined. This figure represents the direct energy expenses associated with mining each Bitcoin.

When the price falls below the electrical cost, it typically lasts only a few days every four years. According to Edwards, this scenario can lead to one of three outcomes: 

1.  The price of Bitcoin could surge dramatically.
2.  Approximately 15% of miners might cease operations.
3.  Transaction fees could remain significantly higher than average.

For this reason, the market’s next movements are highly anticipated, with [analysts keenly watching the $57,000 level](https://beincrypto.com/microstrategy-buys-122-bitcoin-april/). If this support breaks, it could trigger a wave of sales from miners, fulfilling the capitulation scenario.

Short Announced the Altcoins He Closed!

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, spent April with declines. As the declines continued on the first day of May, BTC fell below $ 57,000.

While the decline in BTC is getting deeper, Capo of Crypto, who is known for his bearish views and is frequently criticized by investors with his bearish comments, made a new assessment after today's decline in Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market.

Stating that BTC reached its previous target of $57,000-59,000 and Ethereum reached $2,700-2,800, il Capo said that a local bottom could be seen at these levels.

However, the analyst stated that there is a strong demand below these levels and said that he will not enter any position until he sees a strong downward reaction or approval in BTC and altcoins and that he will be careful before taking a position.

Also adding that he closed CRO and BNB shorts profitably, il Capo added that there is a possibility of further decline.

&gt; “BTC reached its base level of $57k – $59k, while ETH reached $2700 – $2800. What should we expect now?
&gt; 
&gt; We can see a local bottom formation here, but for that we need a strong bullish PA.
&gt; 
&gt; There is significant demand below these levels, and that's a good thing. But I will be careful before entering any position until I see a strong reaction or confirmation.
&gt; 
&gt; I made a profit on my CRO and BNB shorts. They may fall further, but profits are already very good and we are currently at support level.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's see how prices react here. For now, I'm going to wait until we see a reversal.”

URL Source: https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/synfutures-v3-overtakes-uniswap-and-dydx-by-daily-trade-volume

Published Time: 2024-05-01T12:38:00.000Z

Markdown Content:
Points farmers have driven SynFutures v3's daily DEX dominance up to 12%.

SynFutures v3, the surging decentralized exchange for perpetual futures, has emerged as the top DEX by 24-hour trading volume with $1.47 billion.

According to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/), SynFutures v3 accounted for 12% dominance over decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in the last 24 hours. SynFutures beat out the top spot decentralized exchange, Uniswap, and incumbent perpetuals DEX, dYdX V4 — which boast market shares of 11.3% and 11.2% respectively.

SynFutures has risen to the top of the decentralized exchange rankings despite the platform managing a total value locked (TVL) of only $50.47 million, according to data from DefiLlama.

For comparison, GMX v2, a top decentralized perpetuals exchange, boasts a TVL of $325 million, while dYdX holds $320 million, and the Jupiter Perpetual Exchange hosts $291 million.

SynFutures is the latest example of web3 protocol quickly establishing impressive market share on the back of a successful [points campaign](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-to-drop-token-on-may-10).

The project launched its v3 iteration on the Blast Ethereum Layer 2 in February and [unveiled](https://medium.com/synfutures/introducing-synfutures-oyster-odyssey-program-2-0-trading-incentives-unlocked-e025bb5e6266) a points campaign dubbed “Oyster Odyssey” in March. Oyster Odyssey incentivizes users who contribute liquidity or refer other users onto the platform with points, which are expected to qualify holders for an airdrop in the future.

SynFutures said it onboarded more than 400,000 users within two weeks of launching the points campaign.

Oyster AMM
----------

SynFutures v3 also introduced a new exchange mechanism dubbed the Oyster AMM.

Oyster AMM combines elements from order book trading and automated market makers (AMMs) to increase capital efficiency compared to traditional AMM decentralized exchanges.

AMMs were pioneered by Uniswap v1, and allow users to execute trades by interacting with smart contract-based liquidity pools. Liquidity providers supply assets to the pools in exchange for earning trading fees, while price data is provided by third-party oracles, facilitating permissionless on-chain trading.

"Oyster AMM embraces two-sided liquidity but only requires a single token, eliminating the need to provide liquidity for both ends of a token pair and enhancing the overall efficiency of the trading ecosystem,” Synfutures [said](https://medium.com/synfutures/synfutures-v3-launches-on-blast-mainnet-offering-3x-points-through-oyster-odyssey-ahead-of-token-e528cbeb6212).

The first version of SynFutures launched in June 2021 on the Polygon PoS Sidechain and zkSync Era networks. The protocol offered a Synthetic AMM, requiring that liquidity providers only provide a single asset to pools rather than both sides of a pairing.

In December 2022, the project launched SynFutures v2, allowing users to list futures pairings permissionlessly.

SynFutures v3 is already outperforming its previous incarnations, with daily trade volume on v2 peaking at $30.1 million alongside a TVL of just $6.5 million, while v1’s TVL topped out at $7.85 million.

Collectively, v1 and v2 have processed roughly [$23 billion](https://messari.io/report/state-of-synfutures-q3-2023) in trade volume from more than 10,000 users, according to Messari. However, SynFutures v3 beat out its past incarnations during April alone, with the exchange hosting more than $30.1 billion worth of trades last month.

21Shares analyst predicts that tokenized government securities could reach 10% market share.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, has surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to become the world’s largest equity tokenized fund, with $375 million in assets under management (AUM) as of April 30, according to [data](https://dune.com/queries/3095612/5164331) from Dune Analytics.

As of April 28, Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX held the previous top position with $376 million in AUM while BlackRock’s BUIDL was close behind with $349 million in AUM.

The growth comes just six weeks after BUIDL’s debut. The AUM gap between BUIDL and FOBXX widened to $8 million, with BUIDL taking the lead.

[BlackRock launched BUIDL](https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-buidl-tokenized-fund-ethereum/) in partnership with Securitize in March 2024. The fund [captured over $240 million](https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-tokenized-fund-inflows/) in its first week. Last week, BUIDL attracted $70 million, including a significant $50 million from its OUSG token product, Ondo Finance. Meanwhile, FOBXX experienced a 3.7% decrease in its AUM.

The tokenization of real assets is heating up following BlackRock’s participation. Last week, Franklin Templeton announced that it has [enabled direct shareholder transfers](https://cryptobriefing.com/franklin-templeton-benji-token-peer-transfers/) of FOBXX shares on the public blockchain, a move seen as the fund’s efforts to hold its leading position in the market.

Tokenized government securities gain momentum in the asset market
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In a recent post on X, 21Shares analyst Tom Wan suggested that tokenized government securities could grow in their share of the total tokenized asset market, moving from about 1% currently to over 10%.

&gt; 4/ Prediction: Tokenized Government Securities will increase its dominance from 1% to 10%+
&gt; 
&gt; In Jan 2023, Tokenized government securities only accounted for 0.1% of the total tokenized value. Today, it represents ~1.4% of the total tokenized value.

According to Wan, the current demand for tokenized traditional financial assets is not strong. Even among investors who are familiar with crypto, there is a hesitancy to invest in tokenized equities due to low liquidity.

Despite these challenges, there’s a better outlook for tokenizing assets like US Treasuries because there’s already remarkable demand within the crypto space, Wan noted.

&gt; As mentioned, the key issue of tokenization is bootstrapping demand and liquidity. Given the crypto space has an existing demand for US Treasuries such as Ondo (~$350M), Stablecoin Issuers like Circle/Tether/Mountain protocol… [pic.twitter.com/l36z1gS8N7](https://t.co/l36z1gS8N7)

Tether Holdings, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)), reported a record net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

Tether also revealed its net equity for the first time, which stands at $11.37 billion as of March 31. This represents a significant increase from the $7.01 billion worth of equity recorded at the end of December 2023, [according](https://tether.io/news/tether-releases-q1-2024-attestation-reports-record-breaking-4-52-billion-profit-highest-treasury-bill-ownership-percentage-ever-total-group-equity-of-11-37-billion/) to Tether’s attestation report for the first quarter of 2024.

Approximately $1 billion stemmed from operating profits derived from United States Treasury holdings, while the remainder of $3.52 billion comprised the market-to-market gains in the firm’s Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and gold positions.

Tether’s USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin, worth over $110 billion, [according](https://coinmarketcap.com/) to CoinMarketCap data. The company issued $12.5 billion worth of USDT in the first quarter of 2024.

The report also revealed a $1 billion increase in excess reserves that are maintained as a buffer to support the company’s stablecoin offerings. Tether’s excess reserves stood just below $6.3 billion.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/azuki-nft-sales-surge-crypto-market-falls/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T12:20:56+00:00

Markdown Content:
**As the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging to its lowest since February, Ethereum-based Azuki soared to new heights in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector.**

Azuki’s sales reached a striking $1.13 million, marking it as the top-selling NFT collection of the day, according to CryptoSlam data.

Azuki NFT Sales Are Booming as Crypto Market Drops
--------------------------------------------------

The contrast between the declining crypto market and Azuki’s sales spike is stark. [Bitcoin fell about 6.3%](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-drops-57000-reversal/) over the past 24 hours, dropping below the critical $60,000 support level.

Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) saw a decrease of around 5%, falling under $3,000, with other major altcoins such as [Solana](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/) ([SOL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/)) and [Avalanche](https://beincrypto.com/learn/avalanche-avax/) (AVAX) also losing about 6%. The overall crypto market capitalization has dropped by over $20 billion, highlighted by the $540 million [outflow from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-zero-inflows/) since April 20.

According to 10x Research, the average entry price for US Bitcoin ETF holders is around $57,300, which may serve as a pivotal support point if the downtrend continues.

&gt; “There might have been a lot of ‘TradeFi’ tourists in crypto – pushing longs until the halving – this time is now over. We expect more unwinding as the average Bitcoin ETF buyer will be underwater when Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to our target levels and cause a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top – hence our price target of $52,000 to $55,000 during the last three weeks,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen [wrote](https://mail.10xresearch.co/p/bitcoin-miners-sell-5bn-btc-post-halving-altcoin-graveyard).

The cryptocurrency market’s instability contrasts with the thriving NFT sector. Azuki [emerged](https://www.cryptoslam.io/nfts) as the only collection to achieve over $1 million in sales. This surge has pushed Azuki’s total sales volume to approximately $1.12 billion. Subsequently, positioning it as the eighth-largest NFT collection in terms of sales.

Other NFT collections like DMarket and Dokyo also witnessed considerable sales but trailed behind Azuki. DMarket, featuring in-game items on the Mythos network, garnered nearly $887,880, while Avalanche-based Dokyo accumulated about $716,860 from 948 transactions.

Noteworthy, too, is the Bored [Ape](https://beincrypto.com/learn/apecoin/) Yacht Club ([BAYC](https://beincrypto.com/learn/bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc/)) and CryptoPunks, each recording just over $500,000 in sales, showing resilience amidst a challenging market. These figures reflect a growing divergence where select [NFT collections](https://beincrypto.com/learn/nft-marketing-agency/) continue to attract significant investment despite broader market challenges.

This trend suggests a robust, enduring interest in high-value NFTs like Azuki, even as traditional cryptocurrencies face [volatility](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/).

Dog-themed cryptocurrency [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://u.today/shiba-inu-might-be-on-verge-of-reversal-as-470-trillion-shib-support-looms) has experienced a significant price drop in the last 24 hours, shedding nearly 15% of its value. At the time of writing, SHIB had trimmed some of its intraday losses and was down 10.36% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002097. 

On-chain data suggests that the actions of short-term traders may have precipitated the SHIB price downturn. In this regard, [IntoTheBlock](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=all&amp;chart=all)'s holding time of transacted coins indicator seems to offer a clue to Shiba Inu's current investor sentiment. 

The holding time of transacted coins indicator often provides powerful insights into the level of investor confidence and market sentiment.

For SHIB, the holding time of transacted coins stays low, between two weeks and one month, suggesting investors are now more focused on short-term gains.

On April 30, when the SHIB price dropped considerably, the average time held of coins transacted was one month, indicating activity from short-term traders who had bought at the peak of Shiba Inu's rally in March.

[_SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XaNG1RUn/)

Shiba Inu rapidly surged to highs of $0.000045 in early March, which was followed by profit-taking. As buying pressure remained on the market, Shiba Inu managed to pan out highs of $0.00003285 on March 28 before steadily declining in the weeks that followed.

While the influence of short-term traders remains, it might be essential to consider the broader market context. 

The entire cryptocurrency market, driven by [Bitcoin](https://u.today/key-reason-why-bitcoin-btc-fell-to-one-week-low-details), is experiencing substantial losses. Bitcoin fell over 9% on Wednesday, posting its worst monthly performance in April since late 2022, as investors withdrew money from cryptocurrencies ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today.

However, the good news is that [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-at-crossroads-as-69-trillion-shib-hangs-in-balance) appears to be forming a bull flag on the daily chart. According to crypto analyst Ali, validating this pattern might trigger fresh highs for the Shiba Inu price.

A price rebound from about $0.000018343 might lead to a bullish breakout, sending SHIB prices to highs of $0.000072323.

Last Updated: May 1, 2024

*   **Over $479 million liquidated in 24 hours as Bitcoin plunges 9% to $56K.**
*   **The largest single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving $6 million.**
*   **Despite the massive sell-off, analysts remain optimistic about a bullish comeback.**

After the overly bearish April, the crypto market is again starting the new month of May on a red note, with crypto traders languishing in staggering capital losses. [Data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from market tracker Coinglass shows that 141,808 crypto traders faced liquidation over the last day. These traders have lost over $479 million in their investment across various assets. 

The most significant single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving an ETH-USDT-SWAP valued at $6.07 million. This nearly half-billion-dollar fortune wiped out of the crypto scene emerged following Bitcoin’s instability in the last 24 hours. 

As of yesterday, Bitcoin traded at a high of $62,121. However, at press time, it had already plummeted by 9% to trade at a low of $56,555. This sudden turn of events has left crypto bulls reeling from significant losses.

In particular, crypto bulls lost over $401 billion within the past day, while shorters lost only about $63 million. The losses were more pronounced for Bitcoin optimists than other assets, with $150 million liquidated at press time. 

On the other hand, Ethereum investors who bet for higher prices have incurred $107 million in liquidation. Significant liquidations were also recorded for other prominent assets like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Bitcoin’s retest of the $56K range comes about two weeks after the [Bitcoin network halved on April 19](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-sold-8k-last-halving-soared-721-after-will-history-repeat/). Prior to the halving event, there was similar intense selling pressure in the market, with Bitcoin crashing to $60K from the recently attained all-time high of $73,850.  
In his latest analysis, market watcher Rekt Capital has [highlighted](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785590508288389203) that Bitcoin’s revisit of $56K is officially the deepest retrace in this emerging bull cycle. Accordingly, market analysts continue to [maintain](https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1785564391141757222) confidence that the bullish comeback is around the corner.

Markdown Content:
Wormhole is one of the most widely used and known cross-chain bridges. The hub has proven resilient, despite going through one of the biggest exploits, losing $321M in 2022. Since then, Wormhole has grown its connection pairs and interchain features. 

Wormhole Targets Developers Again
---------------------------------

Developers are a scarce resource in the [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/) space. The best may create the next wave of successful projects. Wormhole and Borderless Capital are offering grants to developers who want to create cross-chain features and products. 

The grant program is open for application now and will distribute a total of $50M in locked liquidity. 

&gt; .[@borderless\_cap](https://twitter.com/borderless_cap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has launched a $50 million fund to onboard the next generation of Web3 applications.
&gt; 
&gt; All builders, founders, and developers innovating cutting-edge apps, infrastructure, or tools that span multiple ecosystems are invited to apply. [pic.twitter.com/G60JuSNtXI](https://t.co/G60JuSNtXI)
&gt; 
&gt; — Wormhole (@wormhole) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/wormhole/status/1785323250949771492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Wormhole aims to build a space where the end user can move seamlessly between any two chains, without extra steps or attention. Cross-chain tokens and identities also mean more opportunities for account abstraction, where a user does not need to create a new wallet for each chain.

Wormhole Introduces Native Cross-Chain Tokens
---------------------------------------------

The seamless Wormhole technology means there are now tokens that can exist on several networks, with seamless transfers and locked liquidity. Wormhole itself recently launched its W token, available on some of the most high-profile Web3 networks. 

Wormhole is also adding new tokens with cross-chain mechanisms. Some of the recent additions can move between Solana and Arbitrum, two of the most active chains for decentralized apps. 

The activity of Wormhole varies, but the protocol showed an inflow of transactions in Q1, 2024. In the past 90 days, Wormhole also went through activity spikes, with thousands of cross-chain transactions each day. At baseline, Wormhole handles around 2K transactions, based on DappRadar data.

![Image 1: a graph showing the historical volatility of ethereum](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QxViS0tRTxf5_yGm_x2Zi6E12izHfb16BvMisq2bc0vrMUOIx7Xgpg2B0TclCQiix7iwOcyZGcW5pw7rXsFa1wg12YuhlkImWYgQ2lq0bNEF4go4w0l_Vw_6W785GwbKBYD7yYYOtYvPXAV9mPEh_Ew)

The protocol retained its high credibility, especially after increasing security to avoid more exploits. As of May 1, the [Portal bridge by Wormhole](https://defillama.com/bridge/portal-by-wormhole) received more deposits than withdrawals and supports a reasonable level of baseline activity. Wormhole is used often to transfer different cross-chain versions of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD and others.

Wormhole Offers Staking for Native Token
----------------------------------------

One of the reasons for heightened activity is the launch of the W token. Wormhole partnered with DappRadar to further boost W token distribution. W token buyers can stake through DappRadar in a special program and receive passive returns. 

The W token has been trading for only about a month and is still at the stage of early price discovery. W peaked right after its launch, reaching highs of $1.54. Since then, it has slid to its current price of $0.64, trading sideways for the past two weeks. 

![Image 2: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

After the initial enthusiasm, W token’s trading volumes remain close to $200M per day, with $1.2M in liquidity for each 2% downward slippage. 

After its launch, the W token also managed to defy the market slide, which pushed down major assets. W climbed while Bitcoin (BTC) slid toward the $60,000 barrier. 

Wormhole’s W reached an all-time low at $0.46 and showed its capabilities to bounce and find a higher price range.

Extreme predictions see W breaking as high as $3 in the medium term, as more buyers redirect to the new asset.

&gt; [$W](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24W&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Expensive? Overpriced? Probably.
&gt; 
&gt; It is however showing quite a lot of strength the past 2 weeks while everything else has been getting rekt.
&gt; 
&gt; Good to keep an eye on as it could easily squeeze higher upon a breakout.

A further slide for W may put the token in the accumulation zone, preparing for new attempts at trading higher. Some predictions view W as almost done with the slide after the launch. W was intended as a utility token within the ecosystem.

Wormhole Invests Back into Crypto Space
---------------------------------------

Wormhole is a hub for money to enter and flow through crypto space. The project itself is well-funded, [raising $225M](https://icodrops.com/wormhole/) during a token sale in Q4, 2023. Wormhole is one of the projects to delay the creation of a token, surprising the markets with a late but very successful ICO. The bridge and cross-chain platform has been around for more than three years and is among the first tokenless projects to airdrop an asset.

On its side, Wormhole supported seven other projects like Curvance, NodeKit, Synonym Finance, Omega, Oyl, Zoth and Mayan.

Legendary trader [Peter Brandt](https://x.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1785472622542848389), renowned for his insights into financial markets, has suggested a potential pit stop for Bitcoin before its next rally. In the wake of Bitcoin's recent 9% price drop, Brandt's analysis points toward a scenario where the leading cryptocurrency could dip into the high $40,000s before resuming its bullish trajectory.

Brandt's assessment comes amid growing uncertainty following Bitcoin's significant loss since the beginning of the week, marking its largest drop of the year. With prices plummeting from $64,700 to $57,400, market participants have been gripped by panic and doubt regarding the future of [Bitcoin](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-at-end-of-correction-top-analyst-suggests) and the wider crypto market.

![Image 2: ""](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/btcprice_7.png)

_BTC to USD by_ [_CoinMarketCap_](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)

What's resolution?
------------------

Having witnessed numerous market cycles throughout his extensive career, Brandt highlights a crucial observation: despite past halving events and the launch of ETFs, Bitcoin has failed to surpass its highs from three years ago. 

This insight underscores the importance of resolving current market dynamics, especially as [BTC](https://u.today/its-do-or-die-for-bitcoin-btc-now-peter-schiff) struggles to maintain its upward momentum.

Despite acknowledging a 25% probability that Bitcoin had already reached its local peak at $74,000, Brandt remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing bull market. However, he suggests that corrections may accompany this upward trend, with the potential for the [Bitcoin price](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) to correct by more than 25% from current levels.

Notably, Bitcoin has not revisited the $40,000 mark in the past three months, underscoring the significance of Brandt's proposed pit stop.

**Riot Platforms Inc** RIOT shares are trading higher Wednesday on the heels of the **Bitcoin** BTC/USD mining company’s first-quarter results. Here’s a look at the [highlights from the quarter](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/05/g38547512/riot-platforms-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-high).

**What Happened:** Riot Platforms reported first-quarter revenue of $79.3 million, which missed the [consensus estimate](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings) of $94.859 million, per [Benzinga Pro](http://pro.benzinga.com/). The company reported positive earnings of 82 cents per share, beating estimates for a loss of 14 cents per share.

Riot said it produced 1,264 bitcoin during the quarter, down 36% year-over-year. The company said the decline was primarily due to a significant increase in bitcoin network difficulty. Riot anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 31 EH/s by the end of 2024.

“This quarter, Riot reported net income of $211.8 million and earnings per share of $0.82 which are new record highs for our quarterly results. Additionally, we reported $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, another record high for Riot, rounding out strong financial performance for the quarter,” said **Jason Les**, CEO of Riot.

Riot noted that it has placed three purchase orders with MicroBT for additional mining systems. Deployment of the miners is expected to begin in the second quarter and be completed in the third quarter. Riot expects that it will reach a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 41 EH/s in 2025 upon full deployment.

Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Published Time: 2024-05-01T08:30:28.000-04:00

Markdown Content:
In an escalation of tensions between Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), **Patrick McHenry** (R-N.C.), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has openly criticized [SEC Chair **Gary Gensler**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/03/37538468/sec-chair-gary-gensler-declines-to-say-whether-ethereum-is-a-commodity-its-about-circumsta) for his evasive responses during a congressional hearing.

**What Happened**: McHenry [alleged](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1785317163110130028) that Gensler knowingly avoided clarifying whether the SEC considers **Ethereum**‘s ETH/USD cryptocurrency, ether, as a security.

This accusation was spurred by revelations from court documents indicating the SEC was actively investigating ether’s status just before Gensler’s testimony.

“The refusal of Chair Gensler to address questions about the SEC's stance on ether during the hearing appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the agency’s position,” McHenry asserted on social media platform X, referring to evidence presented in a lawsuit filed by blockchain company **Consensys**.

The debate over whether ether should be classified as a security is not just a legal technicality; it carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Should ether be deemed a security, it could set a precedent for the regulation of numerous other digital tokens, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector.

In response to these developments, crypto attorney **Grant Gulovsen** offered a perspective that highlights the complexities of the SEC’s investigative processes.

“The initiation of an investigation by the SEC does not necessarily equate to an official stance or determination,” Gulovsen explained, indicating that the SEC's inquiry into ether does not confirm its classification as a security.

As these events unfold, the discussion around digital assets continues to evolve, emphasizing the [importance of regulatory clarity](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38461470/fbi-issues-warning-against-unregistered-crypto-services-amid-privacy-concerns).

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/anchorage-digital-tokenized-treasury-fund

Markdown Content:
Anchorage Digital is now custodying shares of a tokenized Treasury fund via a partnership with Arca Labs meant to advance institutional participation in the segment. 

The link-up comes as the tokenization of real-world assets is set to continue as a “defining trend” for institutional crypto in 2024, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Blockworks.

The innovation unit of crypto investment firm Arca first issued shares of its US Treasury Fund as digital asset securities, known as ArCoin, in 2021. The company has argued that ArCoin can replace US Treasurys in enterprise workflows while reducing costs and improving transparency.

The company has now turned to [Anchorage](https://blockworks.co/tag/anchorage-digital) — a crypto-focused bank chartered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — to custody the shares.

![Image 1: two men in business suits posing for a photo](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anchorage-Digital-Co-Founders-Nathan-McCauley-and-Diogo-Monica-3.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024)

_Anchorage Digital Co-Founders Nathan McCauley and Diogo Mónica_

The alliance allows Anchorage clients to keep ArCoin in custody at the bank. Institutions can now access the tokenized shares from the Anchorage platform as it would for the hundreds of assets the company supports. 

**Read more:** [Crypto-focused federal chartered bank intros settlement network](https://blockworks.co/news/federally-chartered-bank-intros-settlement-network)

McCauley has said Anchorage meets the Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition of a “qualified custodian.” The term was included in the regulator’s February 2023 [proposal](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-30) that would “entrust safekeeping of client assets” to such entities.

“Now that institutions have validated the benefits of blockchain technology, companies are seeking the most secure and seamless digital assets solutions that meet US regulatory standards,” Arca Labs president Jerald David said in a statement.

The Anchorage platform uses hardware security modules, which keeps assets offline in segregated, on-chain vaults while keeping them accessible. The model serves as a “major unlock” for institutional participation in [tokenization](https://blockworks.co/tag/tokenization), McCauley argued.

The world’s largest asset manager, [BlackRock](https://blockworks.co/tag/blackrock), launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in March, marking the firm’s first tokenized offering. 

Fellow fund behemoth Franklin Templeton, which debuted its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021, started allowing institutional investors to transfer shares of the fund — represented by BENJI tokens — to other shareholders last week.

Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, previously told Blockworks that BENJI essentially acts as a stablecoin while also generating income. 

“Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our custody support for tokenization projects to advance institutional participation in the ecosystem for the long term,” McCauley said.

*   The Elliptic2 dataset is orders of magnitude bigger than the one used when the team began using machine learning to detect money laundering with bitcoin back in 2019.

*   The research made use of 122,000 groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions called "subgraphs" with known links to illicit activity.


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said it detected potential money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin blockchain after training an artificial intelligence (AI) model using a record 200 million transactions.

The work is an extension of a program carried out [back in 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02591) that used a dataset of only 200,000 transactions. The much larger "Elliptic2" dataset made use of 122,000 labeled "subgraphs," groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions known to have links to illicit activity.

AI becomes more insightful the larger the dataset available to train the machine-learning algorithms, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer a plentiful supply of transparent transaction data on the blockchain. Elliptic used the transactions for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity, [Elliptic said in a paper](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai) co-authored with researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.

"The money laundering techniques identified by the model have been identified because they are prevalent in bitcoin," Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an email. "Crypto laundering practices will evolve over time as they cease being effective, but an advantage of an AI/deep learning approach is that new money laundering patterns are identified automatically as they emerge."

Many of the suspicious subgraphs were found to contain what are known as "peeling chains," where a user sends or "peels" cryptocurrency to a destination address, while the remainder is sent to another address under the user's control. This happens repeatedly to form a peeling chain.

"In traditional finance this is known as 'smurfing,' where large amounts of cash are structured into multiple small transactions, to keep them under regulatory reporting limits and avoid detection," Elliptic said in the paper.

Another commonly occurring technique was the use of so-called "nested services," businesses that move funds through accounts at larger cryptocurrency exchanges, sometimes without the awareness or approval of the exchange. A nested service might receive a deposit from one of their customers into a cryptocurrency address, and then forward the funds to their deposit address at an exchange.

"Nested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering - potentially causing them to feature in subgraphs deemed by the model as suspicious," said Elliptic.
