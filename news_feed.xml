**On early Wednesday morning, blockchain [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) firm Cyvers identified several anomalous transactions on the cross-chain lending protocol of Pike Finance. Cyvers further revealed that this suspicious transaction resulted in a substantial financial loss of approximately $1.6 million.**

The illicit activity was primarily conducted across Ethereum (ETH), [Arbitrum](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-arbitrum/) (ARB), and Optimism (OP) blockchains. The intruder leveraged a privacy-focused tool, Railgun, on Arbitrum for their cyberattack.

Pike Finance Suffered Exploitations Twice in Three Days
-------------------------------------------------------

On-chain surveillance platform CertiK quickly traced the attack‚Äôs origins to April 30. It reveals that the attacker used a method to insert a malicious code by invoking the initialize function, which manipulated Pike Finance‚Äôs smart contract system.

&gt; ‚Äú\[The\] attacker was able to initialize Pike Finance‚Äôs contract, during which the \_isActive variable is set to the attacker‚Äôs address. The attacker could then use this privilege to call the contracts upgradeToAndCall function and change the implementation to one that they had created. They were then able to drain the contract‚Äôs assets,‚Äù CertiK‚Äôs representative told BeInCrypto. **Read more: [Top 5 Flaws in Crypto Security and How To Avoid Them](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-security/)**

According to the detailed breakdown provided by Pike Finance, the attacker upgraded the spoke contracts under a previously compromised framework. They then exploited the smart contract‚Äôs misaligned storage mapping.

&gt; ‚ÄúAs a result, attackers were then able to upgrade the spoke contracts, bypassing admin access, and withdraw funds,‚Äù the Pike Finance team [wrote](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644).

Pike Finance also highlighted its commitment to investigating the breach further. Additionally, it offers a 20% reward for any information leading to recovering the stolen assets. It will also discuss and announce plans to compensate affected users.

The recent exploit has a connection to a vulnerability in its USD Coin (USDC) withdrawal on April 26. Pike Finance acknowledged that the vulnerability is ‚Äúdue to weak security measures in functions managing USDC transfers via CCTP protocol. A critical flaw was found in the functions meant for burning USDC on a source chain and minting on a target chain, which was automated by Gelato‚Äôs services.

The exploitation saw the loss of 299,127 USDC, affecting three networks ‚Äî Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, Pike Finance claimed that the incident only affected USDC assets, and all other assets are safe.

*   **Binance CZ stresses compliance‚Äôs significance in crypto amid a four-month sentence.**
*   **He expressed gratitude for community support, vowing to focus on education post-prison.**
*   **Prominent figures laud CZ‚Äôs contributions to crypto innovation and entrepreneurship.**

Former CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has asserted that ‚Äúcompliance is super important‚Äù for the crypto industry after being sentenced to four months imprisonment. In his latest statement on X after his sentencing, Zhao expressed heartfelt gratitude to the crypto community for their care and support during his trying times.

He noted that those efforts have been pivotal in keeping him strong while he battled the U.S. authorities. ‚ÄúI will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life,‚Äù CZ remarked.¬†

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).

Notably, on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones sentenced the Binance founder to four months in prison. This sentencing comes after CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money-laundering laws with the Binance exchange.

Last November, Zhao admitted guilt to neglecting mandated AML protocols and resigned from his CEO position. On the other hand, Binance settled associated accusations by [paying $4.3 billion.](https://coinedition.com/prosecutors-urge-court-to-accept-binances-4-3-billion-plea-deal/)

Before the Tuesday court pronouncement, the prosecutor contended that Zhao willfully disregarded illegal transactions, thus seeking a prison term of over three years for him. However, the judge disagreed with their recommended sentence.

Following the court judgment, CZ took to X to emphasize that the industry has transitioned into a new phase. He highlighted that compliance is now super crucial for the industry to grow and mature. Also, CZ pointed out that a silver lining of the entire process is that it has put Binance under scrutiny, giving more assurance that ‚ÄúFunds are SAFU.‚Äù¬†

Meanwhile, Zhao disclosed his intention to wrap up the challenging phase and shift his focus to education. Furthermore, he affirmed his commitment to remaining a passive crypto investor.  
Prominent figures in the crypto space, like Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant, [expressed](https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1785520510555820220) gratitude to CZ for his contributions to advancing the space and building entrepreneurs and innovators.

Chinese authorities have captured a person suspected of identity forgery related to the StarkNet (STRK) airdrop.

The suspect has assumed other people‚Äôs identities and submitted over 40 false Early Community Member Program (ECMP)¬†airdrop forms, claiming over 40,000 STRK tokens that initially belonged to the victims.

Following the airdrop, the suspect transferred over 40,000 STRK tokens to an OKX wallet, which were converted to over $91,000 worth of Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)), according to an April 30 local media [report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572).

The suspect, identified as Lan Mou, was captured by the police in the Guangdong Province on April 25, along with a computer and two mobile phones.

While scams and phishing attacks are widespread in the cryptocurrency space, identity theft for claiming other users‚Äô airdrops on such a large scale seems to be a first.

A crypto airdrop is a way of distributing new cryptocurrency, generally for early users who interacted with a certain protocol.

The StarkNet Foundation ‚Äî the organization supporting the Ethereum layer-2 Starknet network ‚Äî launched a [700 million STRK token airdrop](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-airdrop-largely-successful-despite-controversies) on Feb. 20. The airdrop aimed to reward Ethereum solo and liquid stakes, Starknet developers and users, as well as projects and developers outside the Web3 ecosystem.

The airdrop saw significant interest as the first 45 million STRK tokens were claimed in less than 90 minutes.

STRK airdrop was filled with airdrop squatters
----------------------------------------------

On Feb. 20, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg [warned](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1759923340737716287) that the StarkNet‚Äôs eligibility list mainly included airdrop squatters, or professional airdrop hunters, who only farm protocols with an incoming airdrop in hopes of financial gains.

According to the developer, approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were¬†[allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-populated-airdrop-hunters-ahead-token-launch-report) controlled by airdrop squatters who usually farm the same airdrop with multiple addresses to compound the rewards.

In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters [consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-airdrop-sees-1-500-addresses-consolidate-3-3m-into-two-wallets) from the then Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.

![Image 1: Will Bitcoin's 10% tumble in 7 days pull these altcoins down 30% as well?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _AGIX, GRT, and APE, face potential crashes due to Bitcoin‚Äôs bearish chart patterns._
*   _Major altcoins like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana have dropped significantly as well._

In recent developments within the cryptocurrency markets, a significant downturn has been observed, with leading digital currencies including [Bitcoin \[BTC\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction) struggling to maintain their foothold.

As reported by analyst Kyledoops in a video on the [‚ÄúCrypto Banter‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MANczvfQtgA)¬†channel, Bitcoin is facing an inability to break through critical resistance levels.¬†

This has become increasingly apparent over the past week, with the asset seeing a notable drop of over 10% in this period, pushing Bitcoin down to a monthly low in the $58,000 range.

#### **Predictions of a 30% crash**

The downturn is not isolated to Bitcoin alone; the broader altcoin market has also experienced a substantial decline.

From a high of over $1 trillion just last week, the total market capitalization of altcoins has plummeted to $952 billion.¬†

Within this volatile environment, specific altcoins are under the spotlight for potential further losses, according to Kyledoops.

[SingularityNET \[AGIX\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/agix-price-prediction), for example, has already seen a 24% decline over the past week, with a further 10% drop just in the last day.

Technical analysis suggests that AGIX, along with other tokens like [The Graph \[GRT\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/grt-price-prediction) and [Apecoin \[APE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/apecoin-price-prediction), could see an additional 30% fall due to their bearish chart patterns.

Tokens associated with artificial intelligence and gaming are particularly vulnerable.

AGIX‚Äôs daily chart analysis, for instance, shows that the altcoin has shown a clear shift to a bearish trend after breaking its support structure.

Recently, it formed a bearish doji candlestick, followed by a close below this level with an engulfing bearish candlestick, signaling potential for further declines.

Source: TradingView

As for [Fetch AI \[FET\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/fetch-ai-price-prediction), the ‚ÄúCrypto Banter‚Äù analyst anticipated a potential 15% decline. This projection seems plausible, given that Fetch AI‚Äôs chart pattern closely mirrors that of AGIX, which has already signaled further downward movement.

APE, on the other hand, might see its value drop to around $1, marking a potential 20% decrease or even setting new lows.

This prediction is supported by its daily chart, which shows a crucial swing low liquidity level around the $1 mark that could be tested before any potential reversal.

[![Image 3](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201383'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ape-tv.png)

Source: TradingView

Similarly, AXS is poised for a possible 47% drop due to the same reason, further stressing the bearish outlook.

#### Bitcoin: Far-reaching effects

Amidst these projections, the three major altcoins‚Äî[Ethereum \[ETH\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/ethereum-price-prediction), [Binance Coin \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/binancecoin-price-prediction), and [Solana \[SOL\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/solana-price-prediction) ‚Äîhave experienced declines of approximately 8.8%, 8.8%, and 10.9% respectively over the past 24 hours.¬†

An analysis from AMBCrypto highlighted [Solana‚Äôs current technical setup](https://ambcrypto.com/solana-as-key-indicator-slips-47-will-sol-plunge-below-130/): a descending triangle pattern on the 3-day chart, with a support level at $128.

Should market sentiment deteriorate further, there‚Äôs a risk that Solana could breach this support and drop below $130.

ED Introduced its Crypto Wallet To Transfer The Proceeds of Crime
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, the Enforcement Directorate has launched its own Crypto wallet to tackle and transfer the proceeds of financial crime that are in the crypto denomination.  

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is a law enforcement and Economic Intelligence agency in India focusing on enforcing laws related to money laundering, foreign exchange violations, and financial crimes. The ED investigates, prosecutes, and confiscates assets to combat economic offenses.

The move by ED to have its crypto wallet came after a Big Fraud by a gaming app of Kolkata named ‚ÄúE Nugget app‚Äù. This app showcased itself as one the most rewarding gaming app. It promises real cash to its users but has made a big scam. ED unearthed this case in 2022 and till now has recovered 19 crores as cash and 90 Crores in Cryptocurrency in 70 different accounts maintained with [Binance](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-is-back-in-india-after-paying-dollar2-million-fine"Binance"), Zebpay and WazirX.  

### Technological Advancement by Enforcement Directorate¬†

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is leveraging advanced technology to combat financial fraud, focusing on crimes involving cryptocurrencies. With over 900 crores seized in various crypto-related cases, the ED recognized the need to upgrade its tech capabilities to keep up with criminals' evolving tactics.

To do this, the ED has partnered with a digital firm that specializes in iPhone cracking to boost its cyber forensics capabilities. This partnership allows the ED to investigate digital evidence more effectively and catch cybercriminals in the act. Additionally, they're developing software called CEDOS, which stands for Core ED Operations System. This software connects ED officers with data from other agencies, helping them detect financial irregularities more quickly.

The ED is also collaborating with fintech companies to ensure compliance and organize workshops on cybersecurity and digital fraud. They're creating a registry to track suspicious banking correspondents and are using geotagging technology to trace the flow of money. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of data infringement helps detect unauthorized access, while regular audits of digital KYC processes ensure accountability. Through these technological advancements, the ED is equipped to stay ahead in the fight against financial crime.

#### Enforcement Directorate and the use of Crypto Wallet

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has ventured into the crypto world by adopting crypto wallets for its operations. This move has the potential to reshape the crypto market and create a ripple effect on the broader financial landscape. As ED gets more comfortable with this technology, it could lead to reduced crypto-related fraud, fostering a safer environment for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.

With ED embracing this advanced technology, there's a good chance we'll see increased confidence in cryptocurrencies across India. This could even pave the way for more extensive adoption, not just among individual users but also across various government agencies. If the agency's experience with crypto proves successful, it could trigger a new wave of digital innovation, positioning India as a leader in the global crypto space.¬†

Ultimately, ED's engagement with crypto might open doors for broader public acceptance and government endorsement, making cryptocurrencies a more integral part of India's financial ecosystem.

However, only $64.67 million were from [short-sellers](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-short-bitcoin/), while $399.88 million were from [bullish](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) traders with long positions.

Of these, $168.22 million in losses occurred in the last four hours, with $153.17 million coming from the bulls. Finbold retrieved this [data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from _CoinGlass_ on May 1 at 09:30 a.m. UTC.

### Picks for you

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) and Ethereum ([ETH](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/ethereum/)) dominated the 24-hour liquidations with $165.77 million and $120.76 million, respectively. In particular, long-position traders of the two leading [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) lost $145 million and $100 million, with a 61% dominance.

$250 billion erased from crypto as long-position traders got ‚Äòrekt‚Äô
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On April 30, the cryptocurrency market started with a $2.29 trillion capitalization, according to _TradingView_‚Äòs total crypto cap index. On May 1, the index dropped to as low as $2.04 trillion, with nearly $250 billion (10.87%) in losses from the whole ecosystem.

Fear, uncertainty, and doubt ([FUD](https://finbold.com/guide/what-is-hodl/#h-fud)) surged as the dominating sentiments, with long-position traders accumulating massive losses.

Bitcoin led the crash of the month‚Äôs turn, accumulating over 7.5% in daily losses. As of this writing, [BTC trades in the $57,000 zone](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-plummets-under-57000-as-crypto-market-faces-bear-market-reality/).

Meanwhile, long-position traders are concerned as the leading cryptocurrency lost a key [support](https://finbold.com/guide/support-and-resistance/#h-support-definition) level of $60,000. Analysts‚Äô projections vary from a bounce back to previous levels to further long squeezes at $54,000 and $50,000. Interestingly, the former is a key [psychological support](https://finbold.com/guide/support-and-resistance/#h-psychological-support-and-resistance-levels), increasing the likelihood of it becoming a target.

Now, [Investors eye the Federal Reserve interest rate decision](https://finbold.com/investors-adjust-their-bets-on-feds-interest-rate-cut-for-2024/). Essentially, 99.5% of the market expects rates to continue between 525 and 550 basis points. A hawkish approach could bring further turmoil as traders would opt to diminish their exposure to risky assets.

Last week, [Bitcoin ETF investors took a hit from DTCC‚Äôs decision](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-sell-off-alert-as-etfs-take-a-hit-and-money-outflows/) not to recognize collateral value from these funds. Both developments in the United States could have mined [cryptocurrency traders](https://finbold.com/guide/cryptocurrency-trading/)‚Äò confidence, contributing to today‚Äôs $400 million worth of liquidations.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roger-ver-tax-fraud-case/

Markdown Content:
Yesterday, a formal accusation was unsealed, charging Roger Ver, who is a renowned Bitcoin early investor, with several crimes. According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350116/dl?inline), ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus‚Äù will be facing charges of mail fraud, filing false tax returns, and tax evasion crimes.¬†

This weekend, in Spain, Roger Ver was arrested based on these charges, and the US government will initiate his extradition to the US to face charges on US soil.¬†¬†

Roger Ver was a resident of Santa Clara and owned two US corporations that primarily sold networking and general computer equipment. The two corporations, Agilestar.com Inc. and MemoryDealers.com Inc., and Roger Ver allegedly began aggressively stacking up Bitocin back in 2011. According to the allegations, Roger Ver was also an avid promoter of Bitcoins, earning him the alias ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus.‚Äù

Dissecting Roger Ver‚Äôs alleged tax fraud
----------------------------------------

It‚Äôs alleged that on February 4th, 2014, Roger got citizenship in St Kitts and Nevis and quickly renounced his US citizenship thereafter through an expatriation process. As it appears now, this allegedly was Ver‚Äôs master plan to avoid the IRS. According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud), the IRS required Ver to pay tax returns according to US law, covering his capital gains from the sale of his assets, including Bitcoin.

Apparently, when he renounced his US citizenship, Ver was required to pay some tax, referred to as an ‚Äúexit tax.‚Äù The exit tax should have covered all capital gains Roger Ver earned from the sale of his Bitcoins and other assets.¬†

In perspective, it‚Äôs alleged that by Feb 2014, Roger Ver and his companies owned close to 131,000 Bitcoins; among those, his two corporations, Agilestar and MemoryDealers, accounted for nearly 73,000 Bitcoins. These Bitcoins were reportedly traded on various crypto exchange platforms at the time. Notably, as of Feb 2014, each Bitcoin traded at an average market price of $871.

In the process of expatriation, Roger Ver allegedly consulted a particular law firm to help him handle tax returns related to his expatriation. In the process, he also reportedly got a valuator for the valuation of his two companies.¬†

Ver allegedly provided a false account of the number of Bitcoins he owned, which reportedly led to grave undervaluation of his assets, misleading the law firm and the appraiser into filing incorrect returns to the IRS.¬†

According to the indictment, Roger Ver‚Äôs two companies still held onto approximately 70,000 Bitcoins. During that time, Ver allegedly took control of the Bitcoins and consequently sold most of them for almost $240 million in cash on various exchange platforms.¬†

Roger Ver, although not a US citizen at the time, should have reported to the IRS his earnings from dividends and other gains from Agilestar and MemoryDealers, according to the indictment.¬†

The IRS Criminal Investigation‚Äôs Cybercrime is already on the case. Allegedly, Ver caused an estimated loss of $48 million to the IRS.

Markdown Content:
Amidst the challenging circumstances of a prison sentence, Binance founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Changpeng CZ Zhao has [taken](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488) to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to express his gratitude to those who supported him during these trying times.

Binance Founder Promises Resilience
-----------------------------------

On Tuesday, Binance founder [Changpeng CZ Zhao](https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/) was sentenced to 4 months in prison for not putting in place sufficient safeguards against money laundering. As a result, Zhao was charged with several counts of crimes such as money laundering and non-compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.¬†

[![Image 1: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639599248&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=18e26d6e5869861245c0046d78d6875d15f35cee&amp;location=)

During these tough times, the Binance founder received noteworthy support from those who love him. Zhao acknowledged the several types of support he received, including messages and letters, as a way to show his appreciation. An overall of 161 letters of support were sent to Zhao from friends, family, leaders in the business, Binance volunteers, and some community members, among others.

‚ÄúI would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form,‚Äù he stated. According to the [Binance](https://bitcoinist.com/binance-clamps-down-a-new-strategy-to-exclude-us/) founder, everyone who supported him was the reason he never gave up and they all meant so much to him. ‚ÄúI will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life (education),‚Äù he added.

Furthermore, Zhao has underlined his promise to remain resilient by emphasizing his pledge to continue owning and making passive cryptocurrency investments. He then highlighted the significance of adhering to laws and guidelines in the cryptocurrency sector, noting that a new phase has emerged in the industry, and it is crucial to comply with these laws.

[![Image 2: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368621&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287403&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639597255&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=dcbd06eb8fdb0135607795d4ef04845f7b6b0f18&amp;location=)

One bright spot Zhao considers throughout the case‚Äôs entire process is that Binance has been closely watched. Thus, he continues to advocate the crypto platform, affirming that users‚Äô funds are safe and secured.¬†

The Sentence Was Less Than Initial Request
------------------------------------------

It is worth noting that Zhao‚Äôs 4-month prison sentence was far from the 36 months the Department of Justice (DOJ) had [requested](https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-binance-founder-zhao-3-years-in-jail/), and it is only marginally worse than CZ‚Äôs counsel‚Äôs probation-only suggestion. The Justice Department had requested a 36-month term for Zhao, claiming that his legal violations were unprecedented in scope.

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639738072&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=429dbf142554bf83f030d5d735f30819291a37ae&amp;location=)

While prosecutors contended that the sentence ought to correspond with the seriousness of the offenses committed, Zhao‚Äôs defense attorneys countered that their client ought to merely get probation.

[US Judge Richard Jones](https://bitcoinist.com/apologetic-letter-former-binance-ceo-cz-unveiled/) argued that the DOJ‚Äôs request exceeded the guidelines for punishment during the sentencing hearing. Rather, citing no evidence that the defendant was ever informed that Binance was assisting illicit operations, Jones sentenced CZ to four months in prison.

In November 2023, the Binance founder entered a guilty plea for the multiple allegations against him and resigned as CEO of the company. Meanwhile, he was fined $50 million, and Binance was forced to pay an astounding $4.3 billion in fines.

![Image 1: Memecoin mayhem: DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI face $20.54M wipeout, now what?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _DOGE, WIF, and PEPE saw price declines in the last 24 hours._
*   _This resulted in significant long liquidations in their futures markets._¬†

Leading meme assets [Dogecoin \[DOGE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/dogecoin-news/), [Pepe \[PEPE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/pepe-news/), and [dogwifhat \[WIF\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/dogwifhat-news/) witnessed a surge in long liquidations following the general market decline on the 30th of April, [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) data showed.¬†

Liquidations occur in an asset‚Äôs derivatives market when a trader‚Äôs position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it.¬†

Long liquidations happen when the value of an asset suddenly drops, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price rally are forced to exit their positions.¬†

Per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/), the prices of DOGE, PEPE, and WIF have declined by 9%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.¬†¬†

DOGE liquidations totaled $12.48 million during that period, with long liquidations amounting to $12 million.

For PEPE, out of the $6 million worth of closed positions, long positions accounted for over $4 million. WIF experienced total liquidations of $2.06 million, with long liquidations reaching $1.8 million.

#### **The meme assets are at risk of further price declines**

The decline in DOGE‚Äôs price in the last 24 hours and the ensuing long liquidations have led to a spike in short trades opened.

The coin‚Äôs Funding Rate has returned a negative value for the first time since the year began, according to Coinglass.

[![Image 2: DOGE Funding Rate](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%20745'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-01-at-08.08.40.png)

Funding Rates are a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that the contract price stays close to the spot price.¬†

An asset‚Äôs Funding Rate is positive when its contract price is higher than its spot price, and traders who hold long positions pay a fee to traders shorting the asset.

On the other hand, when the Funding Rate is negative, it means the asset‚Äôs contract price is lower than the spot price, and short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions,

DOGE‚Äôs negative Funding Rate showed that there are more traders in its derivatives market expecting its price to fall than there are traders buying the meme coin with the expectation of selling at a higher price.

WIF‚Äôs Futures Open Interest has declined to a multi-month low. At press time, it was $249 million, having fallen by 60% since the 1st of April.¬†

The decline in the meme coin‚Äôs Futures Open Interest showed a rise in the number of traders who have exited their positions without opening new ones.¬†

As for PEPE, despite a similar trend of price decline, the token‚Äôs Futures Open Interest has rallied by 79% in the last ten days, per Coinglass.¬†

However, its negative Funding Rate showed that more people are placing their bets in favor of a decline in the price of the frog-themed meme asset.

Blockchain oracle project Chainlink has partnered with Financial Information eXchange (FIX) connectivity solutions provider Rapid Addition to develop a FIX-native adapter for institutional digital asset trading.¬†

In an announcement, Chainlink said the adapter would be powered by its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), an interoperability protocol with use cases across token transfers, gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi).

![Image 2](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/34978ad9-7ea1-4417-8a33-c25574c47ac7.jpg)

_Source:_ [_Chainlink_](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1783195962430611643)

According to Chainlink, the collaboration will let banks and financial institutions send messages and engage with a ‚Äúbroad spectrum of tokenized assets.‚Äù

The organization believes this is an ‚Äúuntapped market opportunity‚Äù that could have applications across renewable energy products, carbon credits and real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, infrastructure and collectibles.

Vince Turcotte, Chainlink Labs‚Äô business development lead for Asia Pacific, told Cointelegraph banks and financial institutions could do many things with the adapter. Like the company‚Äôs work with the [interbank messaging system SWIFT](https://cointelegraph.com/news/swift-partners-with-chainlink-for-cross-chain-crypto-transfer-project), Turcotte said that financial organizations can encode smart contracts with FIX tags and instructions. The executive explained:

&gt; ‚ÄúWe expect this will be particularly useful for the post-trade environment, as it will allow a single source of truth for trade allocations, which can be shared simultaneously and without duplication between asset managers, brokers, and custodians.‚Äù

Turcotte added that this information can be fed into downstream legacy systems, lowering settlement error and rejection rates.

He added that the integration between Chainlink and FIX ensures existing risk and execution platforms will ‚Äúinteroperate‚Äù with new blockchain-based asset types.

**_Related:_** [**_Tokenization‚Äôs next phase requires real-world data integration ‚Äî Chainlink_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-next-phase-real-world-data-integration)

When asked about how the new adapter may influence institutional adoption for blockchain or crypto, Turcotte expects digitally native institutions to be the first in line to adopt the integration. He explained:

&gt; ‚ÄúWe expect that digitally native institutions will be the early adopters of this integration. These institutions recognize the value of using the FIX protocol to engage with the broader TradFi ecosystem and the value of permanence and truth via blockchain.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the Turcotte believes that asset managers and their clients could benefit from the infrastructure in terms of costs.

"Asset managers and their clients can save costs by having a single source of truth for settlement instructions available to all counterparties to a trade and constantly updated 24/7,‚Äù Turcotte added.

URL Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/reason-bitcoin-price-down-11-since-halving

Markdown Content:
The Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) price has sharply declined over the past few days, which might have triggered some concerns from those who thought Bitcoin would surge after its fourth halving.

The price of Bitcoin has dropped 11% since the fourth Bitcoin halving, which [occurred on April 20](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-completion-confirmed), at 12:09 am UTC.

On the halving date, Bitcoin traded around $64,000. In the immediate aftermath of halving, Bitcoin saw a short rally, topping above $67,000 on April 22. But since then, Bitcoin has been gradually selling off, tumbling below $57,000 on May 1, [according](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) to CoinGecko data.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $57,362, down around 7% over the past 24 hours and more than 17% over the past 30 days.

The sharp decline of the Bitcoin price post-halving might have surprised someone who expected BTC to start rising in the aftermath of halving in line with some of the previous halving-linked cycles.

As previously mentioned, Bitcoin halvings have been historically associated with [post-halving rallies](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter), usually coming in about a year or more. For example, Bitcoin skyrocketed about 3,000% in 17 months after halving in 2016, [reaching a milestone of $20,000](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-20-000-for-the-first-time-in-history) in December 2017.

![Image 2: bitcoin having cycle phases](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/060d243c-e40d-46ee-a299-89c418765a28.jpg)

However, the ongoing cycle has been very [different from the past](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-institutional-impact-price-surge) in terms of Bitcoin halving¬†characteristics. One such difference is that Bitcoin experienced an extraordinary bull run before the fourth halving, [reaching a new all-time high](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-new-73-6-k-all-time-high-etfs-eat) right before the halving event. Such a price trajectory has never been seen before in the history of Bitcoin.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs unique about this latest Bitcoin halving is the incredible bull run and price action leading up to it. Even considering this recent pullback, Bitcoin has still been up 35% since the start of the year,‚Äù Quantum Economics founder [Mati Greenspan](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2021/mati-greenspan) told Cointelegraph.

Greenspan noted that the current drop in the price of BTC was somewhat expected in the context of a decline in the stock market and economic circumstances, stating:

&gt; ‚ÄúConsidering the expectation of yet another Fed pivot and what‚Äôs happening in the stock market, Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action is hardly a surprise. We‚Äôll be a lot smarter about that later today, though.‚Äù

Some crypto analysts have previously predicted that Bitcoin will drop following the fourth halving. In March 2024, Bitcoin analysts from JPMorgan [predicted](https://www.theblock.co/post/279833/jpmorgan-bitcoin-price-april-halving) that Bitcoin could drop toward $42,000 after the halving.

**_Related: ‚Äã_**[**_BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF daily inflow on halt for 4 days_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-inflow-halt-4-days)

According to 10x Research CEO and head analyst Markus Thielen, Bitcoin may fall to $52,000 following the halving. The analyst [believes](https://x.com/thielen10x/status/1785454835191701566) that the primary driver for the recent Bitcoin rally was the inflow of funds into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which has dramatically slowed down in the past month.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/changpeng-zhao-foresees-new-phase-for-crypto/

Markdown Content:
Following the sentencing of [Changpeng ‚ÄúC.Z.‚Äù Zhao](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-founders-fate-hangs-in-the-balance/), founder of [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), to a four-month prison term. The sentence occurred on Wednesday in a Seattle courtroom after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering. These fees that prosecutors claim Binance is guilty of pertain to their practices that encourage expansion at the sale of guardianship.

He tweeted after three years in prison to thank his loyal followers and clarify what he had been through in the legal system. Changpeng Zhao stated that he would responsibly serve his remaining days while working to acquire new knowledge for his education. Furthermore, he informed me that he has a Giggle Academy, a stand-alone online educational platform, in the pipeline.

However, even after Changpeng Zhao, he persistently believes that crypto has a bright future and that he will eventually still make it. He reiterated his intentions to be a silent player in the sector, quietly supporting the chosen path with his investments. In his tweets, he also highlighted the significance of conformance and users‚Äô underhanded maintenance, which might be a silver lining of Binance being under the scanner during his trial.

**Changpeng Zhao unveils online learning hub Giggle Academy**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Changpeng Zhao, in his second attempt, has targeted education more seriously with the establishment of the [Giggle Academy](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-founder-launches-giggle-academy/). Established on a need-to-know basis in early March while in custody, Giggle Academy intends to offer free educational content over the Internet to all students. The delivery of educational topics using this platform presents students from grades one to twelve, emphasizing the teaching process that is interesting and simple to comprehend.

Among the things that will be needed are educators who can design powerful digital material. Unlike other faculty members who schedule consultation hours, Changpeng Zhao views himself as a functional unit who is an active contributor and a learner at the same time. This educational initiative is an outlook on his far-reaching sense of social good that goes beyond his main business of cryptocurrency.

Giggle Academy, a noun phrase, was officially opened and brought on a flashy logo, which was unveiled the week before Zhao‚Äôs sentencing. This logo, done with bright colors and a cheering symbol, represents the initiative‚Äôs core aspirations of bringing positivity and a way of stepping up in the domain of education.

**DOJ seeks harsh sentence, judge disagrees**
---------------------------------------------

Indeed, Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs legal arguments are ample ammunition that Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, is constantly in the headlines. He created an example in this respect, and his case brought attention to problems concerning compliance and regulatory rules within the industry. Zhao cited that exhaustive investigations would have a positive result in reassuring that user funds remain secure (SAFU) and pursuing compliance reasons; this is a case of how crypto space rewards react and adapt.

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).
&gt; 
&gt; I will remain a‚Ä¶
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî CZ üî∂ BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The DOJ, at first, called for a three-year jail term for Zhao with the aim that this case could be a deterrent to other actors who will commit the same crime in the future. Nevertheless, Judge Richard Jones of the U.S. District Court remanded to a more lenient term that likewise echoed what the federal probation office had suggested. Changpeng Zhao will be given credit for the time he has spent there. This can lead to his sentence being reduced significantly, and he will have to spend less time in prison.

The above matter and Zhao‚Äôs follow-up remarks hold the key to a fundamental change in the crypto business ecosystem for high levels of regulatory compliance and transparency. In addition to that, these developments are to cause the modification of future operations for Binance as well as for the whole industry because the partners will attempt to abide by the regulations and protect the interests of their customers.

URL Source: https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium

Published Time: 2024-05-01T10:52:00+0000

Markdown Content:
According to the latest data, Shibarium, the Llayer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu, experienced a surge in transaction fees over the past 24 hours. Thus,¬†[Shibariumscan](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats) reveals that gas commissions paid in BONE, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, skyrocketed by a whopping 500%, soaring from 12 BONE to an astounding 61.47 BONE.

Shibarium facilitates transfers of Shiba Inu tokens, utilizing BONE tokens to cover transaction fees. Notably, each transaction contributes to the burning of¬†[SHIB](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-outshines-doge-and-pepe-in-this-key-metric) tokens, with a portion of the BONE transaction fee being converted into SHIB tokens and sent to the dead wallet.

The surge in fees on¬†[Shibarium](https://u.today/crucial-ethereum-shib-warning-sent-to-community-by-shiba-inu-rep) can be attributed to several factors - primarily heightened network activity. With the recent surge in popularity of Shiba Inu tokens amid market volatility and heightened investor interest, the demand for transactions on the Shibarium network has surged.

![Image 1: ""](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/shibar_2.png)

_Source:_ [_Shibariumscan_](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats)

Further validating this surge in online activity is the remarkable uptick in active accounts, which soared by a staggering 211%, catapulting from 1,724 to 3,650 within the same 24-hour window.

Intriguingly, while the number of new accounts did not witness a surge, it rather experienced a decline. This suggests that the surge in activity predominantly emerged from existing accounts, rather than newbies onboarding into the ecosystem.

What's next for Shiba Inu?
--------------------------

This surge in transaction fees and network activity raises important questions about the future trajectory of Shiba Inu's network and tokens.

Will this surge in fees foretell a further activity boost within the¬†[Shiba Inu](https://u.today/billions-of-shiba-inu-shib-by-coinbase-in-24-hours-whats-happening) ecosystem? How will Shibarium adapt to accommodate the growing demand while maintaining efficiency and scalability? Moreover, what implications does this surge have for SHIB and BONE, especially considering the chaos on the general crypto market, with bearish investors seeming to prevail?

In his statement on the X platform today, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shed light on the importance of decentralized security when it comes to managing cryptocurrency assets.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Advocates Decentralized Security in Cryptocurrency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He highlighted the use of multisig wallets, a method he personally uses to protect over 90% of his own digital funds.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds üôÇ
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Multisig, short for multi-signature, refers to a wallet that requires more than one key to authorize a transaction.

In Buterin's case, he uses an M-of-N setup in which he has some of the keys, but not enough to prevent the funds from being recovered. The remaining keys are entrusted to other people he trusts.

Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining confidentiality in this installation. He recommended that the identities of those holding other keys not be revealed, even to each other. He believes this approach is a way to ‚Äúdecentralize your own security.‚Äù

This advice comes at a time when the use of hardware wallets and the risks associated with them are under scrutiny. Buterin's method offers an alternative approach, emphasizing the importance of decentralization and trust in increasing security in the cryptocurrency space.

As digital currencies continue to gain worldwide attention, such insights from industry leaders like Buterin are invaluable in guiding users on how to safely manage their digital assets.

*   **Azuki led Tuesday‚Äôs NFT market with $1.13 million in sales.**
*   **BAYC and CryptoPunks each secured over $500,000 in sales.**
*   **Ethereum leads the intraday trading volume at around $8.5 million.**

Recent data from the NFT market shows that Ethereum‚Äôs Azuki topped Tuesday‚Äôs trading chart, printing US$1.13 million. This surge increased Azuki‚Äôs total sales volume to US$1.12 billion, making it the eighth-largest NFT collection.

According to data from [CryptoSlam](https://www.cryptoslam.io/), Azuki was the only NFT to hit the $1 million mark on Tuesday, as sales fell to a low of $2 million for the first time since April 12.

Moreover, DMarket, a provider of in-game assets on the Mythos network, accumulated the second-most sales, reaching US$887,880. In addition, the Avalanche-based Dokyo collection took third place, generating US$716,860 from 948 transactions.

Meanwhile, collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks saw impressive outings, each securing just over US$500,000 in sales. Yuga Labs‚Äô recent restructuring news has triggered an uptick in BAYC‚Äôs market performance, with its trading volume soaring by 80% to 1,300 ETH ($4.2 million) on Tuesday.¬†

Along the same lines, BAYC NFTs sales numbers have seen over 52% jump, reaching 96. The estimated market cap also increased to 147,139 ETH ($466 million), representing roughly 11% of the total NFT market capitalization of $4.23 billion.¬†

Furthermore, the Bitcoin-based $WZRD BRC-20 NFTs wrapped up its most successful month, with April sales totaling US$36 million. Despite the launch of new Bitcoin-based projects like Runes on the network‚Äôs halving day, its total monthly sales dropped to US$598 million in April, down from March‚Äôs US$622 million.

Similarly, Ethereum-based NFTs saw a decrease in performance, recording sales of US$241.5 million in April, marking the lowest monthly sales since last October.

Nonetheless, the NFT market has hit an uptrend recently, prompting various blockchains and projects to witness significant rallies in value and sales. At the time of writing, Ethereum recorded the highest sales volume over the last intraday trading session, hitting about $8.5 million.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-tokenless-protocols-one-hottest-in-may/

Markdown Content:
Tokens in crypto are often a dime a dozen, quite literally. Generating a token is almost trivial; new ones are minted every minute. To counteract this glut of new assets, a group of protocols has decided to build their economy first, consolidate a community, and add the token later; hence, tokenless protocols have broken onto the scene.

The appeal of no-token projects is the potential to receive an airdrop with no requirement to make an initial investment.¬†

Among high-profile no-token protocols was the EigenLayer platform, which awarded ‚ÄúEigen points‚Äù for re-staking LST-ETH. Currently, EigenLayer is going through an airdrop process, though immediate movement of the tokens may not be possible and the tokens are unavailable for all regions.

New Tokenless Protocols Gain Visibility in May
----------------------------------------------

Bitcoin‚Äôs RGB is a no-token protocol, which does not sell a native asset. Games and Web3 projects have also launched without a token, aiming to build up a reputation first.¬†

In May 2024, a long list of projects is either continuing without a token or planning an airdrop phase.¬†

Most protocols offer infrastructure for trading or [DeFi](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/), including exchanges, bridges, swap mechanisms or prediction markets. Despite the lack of a token, those protocols are already locking in value.¬†

Based on DeFi Llama statistics, more than 400 protocols are locked in above $1M, and about 140 projects with liquidity above $20M. When working on smaller projects, developers often incorporate DeFi, liquidity, and other Web3 infrastructure into their products. The biggest projects are dominated by various restaking platforms, trying to copy the success of EigenLayer.

Which Tokenless Protocol to Choose in May
-----------------------------------------

Joining a tokenless protocol may still require some form of initial deposit, such as staking, or another investment to start farming points. Protocols also go through boom and bust cycles, and not all guarantee that the points earned will be eligible for a token. The token itself would also try to survive in the market. Despite this, farming a tokenless protocol is one of the crypto opportunities in May.¬†

&gt; Good airdrop farming opportunities are becoming increasingly rare at this point in the cycle
&gt; 
&gt; I went through 64 of the more well-known tokenless protocols and put them in tiers based on how/if I would farm them [pic.twitter.com/CYP1i9lVAo](https://t.co/CYP1i9lVAo)
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî Blur (@BlurCrypto) [April 27, 2024](https://twitter.com/BlurCrypto/status/1784290860928012539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Tokenless protocols also require activity on the side of the user. Points or eligibility are earned in exchange for using bridges, trading, staking, providing liquidity, trade NFTs, complete tasks and milestones or for holding other assets. For crypto insiders, tokenless protocols may be a tool to gain additional value from activities they are doing anyway.

Tokenless Farming: Be Early, Avoid Scams
----------------------------------------

Tokenless protocols appeared in late 2023, and gathered speed in Q1 2024. User awareness means the competition is even tougher, and being early is the key to getting the highest rewards.¬†

The game in May 2024 is to look for underfarmed protocols, where even a few small tasks can bring rewards, which can become valuable later on.¬†

&gt; if you still did not farming Zora, remember: 60MI funding + probably one of the few ACTUALLY underfarmed tokenless projectsüß†

Tokenless protocols are also aggregated for more convenient farming. It is not unusual for power users to engage with as many as 100 protocols. This is possible on networks like Solana, Sui, Arbitrum and [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/) Smart Chain, which have periods of extremely low fees.¬†

Farming a [tokenless protocol](https://guild.xyz/explorer) is also a matter of choosing a role and techniques that are known and comfortable for the end user. Most tokenless protocols require a wallet to engage, but may hold risks. Not all projects are audited, so getting exposed to a role in their ecosystem may be risky. Reward points also do not guarantee a favorable conversion to tokens.¬†

Not all tokenless protocol farming is going smoothly. One of the high-profile projects, IO.net, issued points for running a user‚Äôs GPU for security and computation. Malicious users faked their GPU data to receive points without real work.¬†

After the incident, IO.net resolved the bug and increased transparency, to make point distribution more fair. The project is now preparing for an imminent airdrop, while entering another reward cycle.¬†

What are the Risks of Tokenless Protocols?
------------------------------------------

Like all crypto trends, tokenless protocols have reached hype status. The risks range from a waste of time to a loss of assets. Other risks include Sybil attacks and exploits from malicious farmers, who may find loops in the protocol and receive outsized rewards.

It is also unknown if the tokenless protocols will continue to be successful once the farming stops. The incentives to interact with the protocols may still depend on receiving rewards. The success of tokenless protocols also depends on the viability of the underlying technology and its use cases as part of the DeFi ecosystem.

The International Criminal Police Organization for Africa (INTERPOL Africa) has confirmed the completion of extradition paperwork for Binance Holdings Limited executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who fled the jurisdiction.

INTERPOL Africa‚Äôs Vice-President, Garba Umar, [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIaM_Z_v2Y) this information during an appearance on the April 30 edition of Sunrise Daily program on local news agency Channels Television.

In the interview, Umar added that the organization is actively working with the governments of different countries by serving a red notice against Anjarwalla and presenting necessary treaties, a Memorandum of Understanding, and other documentation to facilitate his extradition to Nigeria for trial.

The Interpol official did not confirm that Anjarwalla is currently held in Kenya but noted that the fleeing crypto executive was last seen there. Umar said:

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware but what I can tell you is that the last destination I know on my record of this guy when he fled (Nigeria) was Kenya. That I can confirm to you.‚Äù

Umar added that Interpol had contacted all countries where Anjarwalla was believed to have transited, and ‚Äúwe got some certain information which is not possible to share on this platform.‚Äù

Anjarwalla, who was detained with his colleague Tigran Gambaryan on [charges of money laundering](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-detained-us-exec-more-charges-nigeria) and tax evasion, [escaped custody under the National Security Adviser](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-executive-escapes-detention-nigeria) on March 22 and fled to Kenya.

**_Related:_** [**_Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs 4-month sentence a ‚Äògeneral deterrence,‚Äô says lawyer_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-prison-sentence-general-deterrence-says-lawyer)

Anjarwalla reportedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East airline. However, it is unclear how he managed to board the international flight, as his United Kingdom passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remains in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.

While Anjarwalla remained out of the country, Gambaryan pleaded not guilty to the charges.

After several weeks in detention, his wife and others are calling for his release. Gambaryan‚Äôs wife¬†[launched](https://www.change.org/p/help-bring-former-us-federal-agent-tigran-gambaryan-home-from-unjust-detention-in-nigeria) a petition to bring him back to the United States, which had 4,161 signatures at the time of publication. Gambaryan's next [bail hearing is on May 17.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-exec-nigeria-bail-hearing)

On March 5, Binance announced that it intended to [cease all naira transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-cease-all-naira-services), effectively exiting the market. Binance also mentioned that Binance‚Äôs peer-to-peer platform [delisted all naira trading pairs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-drops-naira-government-scrutiny) in late February.

On Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were [handling illicit transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-central-bank-head-criticizes-binance-execs-reportedly-arrested)¬†and¬†pointed to ‚Äúsuspicious flows‚Äù of funds at Binance.

Published Time: 2024-05-01T10:42:39+00:00

Markdown Content:
Less than four weeks ago, Roger Ver published his version of Bitcoin‚Äôs 2015-2017 blocksize wars. In Ver‚Äôs first full-length book, _Hijacking Bitcoin,_ he attempted to question the Blockstream-led narrative of the user-activated soft fork that ostensibly saved Bitcoin from the miner-activated soft fork proposal of big blockers like Ver, [Gavin](https://protos.com/did-craig-wright-use-staged-laptop-at-satoshi-key-signing-ceremony/) [Andresen](https://protos.com/did-craig-wright-use-staged-laptop-at-satoshi-key-signing-ceremony/), Mike Hearn, [Calvin](https://protos.com/calvin-ayre-leaves-x-after-court-finds-craig-wright-is-not-satoshi/) [Ayre](https://protos.com/calvin-ayre-leaves-x-after-court-finds-craig-wright-is-not-satoshi/), Jihan Wu, and [Craig Wright](https://protos.com/craig-wright-is-not-satoshi-nakamoto-judge-rules/).

A few days later, authorities arrested Ver in Spain for unrelated tax fraud.

The unfortunate sequence of events continues something of a trend in Ver‚Äôs life. His idealism has frequently led to encounters with law enforcement. In 2002, for example, he spent 10 months in prison for selling prohibited items (mainly firecrackers) via eBay.

Another detention center stay for Roger Ver
-------------------------------------------

According to a newly unsealed indictment this month, Ver allegedly **defrauded the US out of more than [$48 million](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud)**. According to the IRS, ‚Äúhe concealed and provided false information to his various advisors regarding the number and value of bitcoins he owned and controlled both personally and through his companies.‚Äù

Spanish authorities arrested Ver this month and are detaining him pending extradition proceedings to the US court system.

The US Justice Department (DoJ) will seek to try him in a federal courthouse for his criminal charges. In addition to demanding payment of overdue taxes plus penalties, authorities will seek a prison sentence. In national criminal proceedings, discretion is given to a federal judge to decide the ultimate terms of punishment.

As the predecessor of modern-day celebrities like Michael Saylor, **Ver was Bitcoin‚Äôs most prominent spokesperson** prior to 2017.

The Gospel of Bitcoin Jesus
---------------------------

For Ver (a.k.a. Bitcoin Jesus), Bitcoin was primarily a freedom technology ‚Äî a tool in his arsenal of other self-sovereign tools like privacy tools, crisis gear, home fortifications, and guns.

Ver wanted Bitcoin‚Äôs blocksize to increase so that data storage for everyday commerce transactions would be affordable and fast. In his new book, he argues that he doesn‚Äôt regret championing the Bitcoin Cash version of Bitcoin, even though he‚Äôs widely viewed as the loser of the blocksize war.

Eventually, Ver began arguing that Bitcoin should fork its consensus node software to increase its block data storage size. Specifically, he advocated for a large data version of Bitcoin that still operates today, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Fast forward to today, and **BCH has a 99.3% smaller market capitalization than bitcoin (BTC)**.¬†

Defeated, he retired from his media career and lived a quieter life in the Caribbean. ‚ÄúI absolutely made a deliberate decision to do less media stuff,‚Äù he [admitted](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/roger-vers-next-life-cryonics-meets-crypto/). ‚ÄúThat civil war is kind of over now.‚Äù

This month, he was traveling in Spain. Law enforcement arrested him and are holding him in a Spanish detention center.

&gt; I have no love for Roger Ver, but I won‚Äôt celebrate his misfortune.

Ver‚Äôs alleged tax fraud
-----------------------

According to the DoJ, Ver illegally reduced his tax liability by transferring ownership of his bitcoin to several companies in order to evade an ‚Äòexit tax‚Äô requirement prior to renouncing his US citizenship. That scheme failed. Simply shuffling assets to one‚Äôs own companies and claiming not to own those assets as of a snapshot date for tax purposes is classic tax fraud. Worse, Ver wrote down his plans for this type of scheme in an email, which law enforcement obtained as evidence against him.

The DoJ also alleges that Ver provided or caused to be provided false and misleading tax information to his attorney.

On Ver‚Äôs expatriation-related tax returns (IRS forms 1040NR and 8854), his attorney didn‚Äôt report that Ver owned any bitcoin personally as of March 2, 2014 when Ver furnished his statement of voluntary relinquishment of US Citizenship to a US consulate.¬†

To make things even worse, Ver‚Äôs attorney **incorrectly dated his expatriation** to February 3 rather than the true March 2 date.

It‚Äôs fine to legally avoid taxes, but evading taxes is a crime. Once again, Roger Ver is arrested and unless he strikes a plea deal, a jury will determine whether he is guilty of tax evasion.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/venom-foundation-launched-scam-nft-project/

Markdown Content:
Here we go again. Another day, another negative report that further exposes Venom Foundation‚Äôs utter shadiness. If you remember, last year, we wrote two exclusive [reports](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-fall-of-venom-foundation-cautionary-tale/) on the company that [detailed](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/murders-fraud-venom-networks-owner-exposed/) its inside operations and the alleged notorious secret founder, Alibek Issaev.

And now, we have been approached by [Venom Punks](https://twitter.com/venom_punks), the first-ever [NFT](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/nft/) project on the Venom network with yet another inside look at Venom Foundation, its centralization and fraud, the team that initially founded the project, and why the current team wants nothing to do with the foundation anymore.

The beginning
-------------

The journey of Venom Punks began with high hopes in late 2022, when the team behind the project first explored the potential of the Venom [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/). Envisioned as a platform that supported fair competition and innovation, Venom initially attracted Venom Punks with its promise of decentralization and support for developers. However, the reality they encountered was starkly different because Venom Foundation operates in a very centralized manner.

As Venom Punks set out to develop their project, which included launching several dApps like VenomSea and Wrapped Venom Station, they noticed a troubling pattern. Another project, venom-punks.com, not only mirrored their initiatives but also seemed to receive undue support from the Venom Foundation. This copycat project was reportedly backed by the foundation to the extent that it overshadowed the original efforts of Venom Punks.

&gt; ‚Äú**_Venom Foundation seems more like a centralized chain, run like a family business. This setup could favor family, friends, and relatives, giving them advantages over other builders. For builders not close to the Venom Team, this means limited success chances._**‚Äú
&gt; 
&gt; Venom Punks

Venom Punks set up accounts on Discord, Twitter, and launched its domain in January of 2023. Venom Punks said they reported the scam collection in May of the same year after thorough research, and decided to take a stand and expose what they described as fraudulent activities by the Venom Foundation.

They revealed that venom-punks.com, despite its lack of originality, thrived with direct foundation support, overshadowing Venom Punks‚Äô genuine efforts. The climax of their accusations pointed to a possible collusion between the foundation and venom-punks.com to clone Venom Punks‚Äô original NFT designs and concepts. Venom Foundation‚Äôs current CEO Christopher Louis Tsu even went on Twitter to publicly endorse the scam collection.

A major turning point occurred when Slava Semenchuk, known by his Discord username Venominator, joined the Venom Punks Discord server on March 30 this year. His alleged intention was to defend venom-punks.com.

Semenchuk tried to portray the project as legitimate and gain from the original Venom Punks‚Äô popularity, presenting himself as an innocent party caught in a misunderstanding. However, his presence and actions quickly raised suspicions among the vigilant Venom Punks community.

The Venom Punks team, equipped with solid evidence of the deceptive practices of venom-punks.com, confronted Semenchuk, who found himself unable to substantiate his claims and eventually left the server. His departure was not quiet, though.

He inadvertently confirmed the suspicions of many by exposing a direct link between the scam project and the Venom Foundation.

The clone war
-------------

The association between the scam project and Venom Foundation was confirmed by Venom Punks through multiple channels, including public discussions and promotional materials where the foundation‚Äôs support for the clone project was openly acknowledged.

These actions raised serious ethical questions. Was the foundation‚Äôs involvement a calculated move to push out the original innovators in favor of a controlled, less threatening project that they could manipulate? After all, they‚Äôre not really decentralized.

The extent of the foundation‚Äôs duplicity became clearer through the actions of the clone project‚Äôs founder. Not only did he launch a project with the same name, but he also engaged in misleading marketing tactics and false advertising, including offering nonexistent features and promotions to attract users.

When these deceitful strategies were brought to light, rather than retracting or apologizing, he doubled down, attempting to cover his tracks and continue his deceptive practices. These practices included the abrupt removal of outrageous offers, like a supposed trip to Dubai, from their website when they were called out for being unrealistic.

Moreover, the clone project‚Äôs readiness to launch on the same day as the original Venom Punks‚Äô minting phase, as revealed by their conflicting mint date announcements, was a direct attack aimed at diverting traffic and sales from the original to the clone.

![Image 1: a screenshot of a message from the venom team](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.jpg)

A tense moment came when CEO Christopher unintentionally acknowledged the legitimate VenomPunks.com in a public response. This slip triggered a strong reaction from the venom-punks.com team, particularly their leader, who seemed visibly upset and even threatened to undermine the Venom Foundation. This reaction raises a serious question. What secret agreements are at play behind the scenes?

Despite the ongoing support from the Venom Foundation, venom-punks.com has openly criticized the foundation, accusing it of being disorganized. The irony of this situation is striking. Here is a project that, despite its questionable legitimacy and the foundation‚Äôs backing, publicly denounces the very organization that supports it. Kind of disturbing.

Then came the involvement of Oasis Gallery. Official statements from the foundation described Oasis Gallery as an independent third-party dApp. However, contradicting this claim, the venom-punks.com team indicated that the gallery was closely linked to the Venom Foundation, suggesting the foundation had major influence or even control over Oasis operations.

The legitimacy of VenomPunks.com was further compromised when Oasis Gallery listed their collection without consent and initially marked it as verified, potentially to boost its visibility and sales. However, just minutes after realizing the implications of their actions, the foundation requested the removal of the listing from the homepage.

This rapid sequence of actions demonstrated a deliberate attempt to manipulate market visibility to favor the scam project over the legitimate creators. When Venom Punks requested the removal of their collection from Oasis Gallery to maintain control over their project‚Äôs presentation and sales, their requests were blatantly ignored.

Internal struggles
------------------

The Venom Foundation has been facing some serious internal and financial challenges, starting with the departure of former CEO Mustafa Kheriba. The reasons behind the delayed launch of its mainnet are deeply tied to the organizational shake-up and the parting ways of Kheriba‚Äôs financial investment company with the foundation.

Post-Kheriba, the Venom Foundation experienced operational difficulties, primarily because it outsourced most tasks and its team worked remotely. The setup began to crumble as financial constraints became apparent. The lack of adequate compensation led to a mass exodus of professionals who were essential to the foundation‚Äôs operations, leaving the foundation struggling with an underqualified and understaffed team.

Further complicating matters, VenomPunks.com claimed to have uncovered troubling inconsistencies within the Venom ecosystem, particularly with how certain data was being handled and displayed. For instance, VenomArt and VenomScan were found displaying the total supply of the ‚ÄúDrunk Soda‚Äù collection as 2,750, despite the smart contract showing a total of zero.

![Image 2: a screen shot of a website showing a cartoon character](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png)

This discrepancy raises serious questions about the reliability of the foundation‚Äôs technology and its adherence to blockchain standards, specifically the TIP4 protocol mandated by RFC2119. Finally, the VenomPunks.com team decided to confront the foundation with evidence of misconduct involving the scam project, venom-punks.com.

Initially, there was hope that presenting this evidence would prompt the foundation to take corrective actions. However, instead of addressing the issues, the foundation alerted the scam project, leading to an attempt by both parties to erase the evidence.

Venom-punks.com‚Äôs response to the exposure was to distance itself from the foundation, claiming that it was not an official project of the Venom Foundation. This claim came too late and seemed like a desperate attempt to salvage whatever was left of its reputation.

The culmination of these issues has led VenomPunks.com to make a difficult but necessary decision ‚Äî to leave the Venom chain. The foundation‚Äôs inability to maintain a fair and competitive environment, combined with its failure to support and protect genuine developers, has forced VenomPunks.com to seek a new platform where integrity and equal opportunities are valued.

A security researcher was rewarded $250,000 for discovering a vulnerability that has historically allowed hackers to pull out millions of dollars from cryptocurrency protocols.¬†

Pseudonymous cybersecurity researcher Marco Croc from Kupia Security identified a reentrancy vulnerability in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance.

In an X thread, he [explained](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675) how the bug could be exploited to manipulate balances and withdraw funds from liquidity pools.

Curve Finance acknowledged potential security flaws and ‚Äúrecognized the severity of the vulnerability,‚Äù Marco Croc explained. After a thorough investigation, Curve Finance awarded Marco Croc its maximum bug bounty award of $250,000.

According to Curve Finance, the threat was classified as ‚Äúnot as dangerous,‚Äù and they believed they could recover the stolen funds in such a case.¬†

However, the protocol said a security incident of any scale ‚Äúcould have caused serious panic if it had happened.‚Äù

Curve Finance recently recovered from a $62 million hack in July. As part of returning to normalcy, the DeFi protocol voted to reimburse $49.2 million worth of assets to the liquidity providers (LPs).

_Source: [Curve Finance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1737998103188553846)_

On-chain data confirms that 94% of tokenholders approved the disbursement of tokens worth over $49.2 million to cover the losses of the Curve, JPEG‚Äôd (JPEG), Alchemix (ALCX) and Metronome (MET) pools.

According to Curve‚Äôs proposal, the community fund will supply the Curve DAO (CRV) tokens. The final amount also includes a deduction for the tokens recovered since the incident.

‚ÄúThe overall ETH ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) to recover was calculated as 5919.2226 ETH, the CRV to recover was calculated as 34,733,171.51 CRV and the total to distribute was calculated as 55‚Äô544‚Äô782.73 CRV,‚Äù reads the proposal.

The attacker exploited a vulnerability on stable pools using some versions of the Vyper programming language. The bug made Vyper‚Äôs 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 versions vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

[Bitcoin](https://qz.com/bitcoin-history-creation-origin-price-1851347621) has continued its April wipeout into May, falling almost all the way to $57,000 on Wednesday morning and technically entering into a bear market after [its worst month in almost a year-and-a-half](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-on-pace-for-its-worst-month-since-november-2022-heres-whats-driving-the-decline-e168ddad?&amp;mod=home-page).

**TL;DR**

*   Despite recent price drops in the cryptocurrency market, including bitcoin, some investors seem interested in potential purchasing opportunities, reflected by increased searches for ‚Äúbuy the dip crypto.‚Äù
*   On-chain metrics like the MVRV ratio and shifts in open interest suggest a potential turnaround, indicating it might be a good time to invest in the primary digital asset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Viewing the Crypto Crash as a Buying Opportunity
------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency sector has been in¬†a state of¬†severe correction in the past few weeks, with the situation intensifying today (May 1).

The global crypto market capitalization plunged to approximately $2.2 billion, while bitcoin‚Äôs price [tumbled](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) below $57,000 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data) for the first time since late February. Popular altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have performed even worse, witnessing double-digit declines on a daily scale.

However, one¬†important indicator hints that some investors remain unfazed, viewing the current grim reality as a great chance to enter the crypto ecosystem at a discount. According to Google Trends, searches for the phrase ‚Äúbuy the dip crypto‚Äù [spiked](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en)¬†[](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en)to a level unseen since May 2022. The overall sentiment in the crypto market has turned neutral for the first time in three months, which it spent in ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù territory. This could be another sign that the market is done cooling off as participants‚Äô greed has been reduced. After all, people should be ‚Äúfearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful,‚Äù as stated by Warren Buffett.

Optimistic Metrics for Bitcoin (BTC) Amid the Crash
---------------------------------------------------

As¬†_CryptoPotato_¬†recently¬†[reported](https://cryptopotato.com/these-metrics-suggest-it-is-time-to-buy-bitcoin-amid-btcs-price-drop-bitfinex/), several on-chain metrics signal that hopping on the BTC bandwagon¬†at the moment¬†might be the right choice. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator, which has been experiencing a downfall since the beginning of April, is one example.

A score above 3.5 hints that the Bitcoin price is close to its peak, whereas a result below one warns about a bottom.¬†The MVRV ratio dipped to 2.21 at the end of February, flashing the¬†buy signal for the leading digital asset.

Another major metric is the¬†open interest (OI) weighted funding rate, which experienced a positive shift on April 24. According to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, the move shows rising interest in long BTC positions and a change in market sentiment from bearish to bullish.

Last but not least, we will touch upon the Bitcoin exchange¬†netflow. The indicator has been predominantly negative in the past week, [pinpointing](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-netflow-total?exchange=spot_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=column) a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods.¬†This¬†is considered¬†bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

[Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) recently shared some insightful tips on securing [cryptocurrency](https://u.today/dogecoin-doge-founder-comments-on-crypto-market-crash) holdings, highlighting unconventional but highly effective methods. While hardware wallets are widely recommended for their robust security, Buterin points out the risks they carry, notably due to human error. Common pitfalls include misplacing the recovery seed, hiding it so well that it is eventually forgotten, or unforeseen situations like needing to move, leaving the seed in a bank safety deposit box.

To counteract these risks, Buterin adopts a sophisticated approach known as multisignature for over 90% of his personal funds. This method is not just about diversifying security measures ‚Äî it is about decentralizing them. In a multisig setup, a transaction requires the approval of multiple, separately held keys to proceed, which significantly mitigates the risk of loss or theft.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds üôÇ
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Buterin recommends an M-of-N scheme, where "M" represents the minimum number of approvals needed from a total of "N" possible keys. Importantly, not all keys are held by one person, and the identity of the holders is kept confidential, even from each other.

This technique enhances security by not relying on a single point of failure. If one key is compromised, the funds remain secure as long as the other required keys are safe. However, it does depend on the trustworthiness and reliability of those who hold the other keys.

[Buterin](https://u.today/vitalik-buterin-delivers-sobering-verdict-on-proof-of-work-ethereum) also critiqued the Shamir Backup, another method that splits a seed into multiple parts. While it sounds secure, Buterin argues that it is easier to mishandle compared to a multisig setup. The complexity and risk of error in reassembling the seed parts can outweigh its security benefits.

One way or another, if you are willing to feel safe when using digital assets, avoid some red flags like storing large amounts of cryptocurrency on exchanges, in decentralized applications or a custodial crypto storing service.

Published: May 1, 2024

Last Updated: May 1, 2024

*   **Saylor‚Äôs strategic stock sales capitalize on MicroStrategy‚Äôs soaring value, showcasing astute financial planning.**
*   **Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility spotlights the evolving dynamics between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets.**
*   **MicroStrategy‚Äôs premium over Bitcoin raises questions about investor sentiment versus fundamentals.**

[Reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSTR:US) assert that MicroStrategy‚Äôs executive chairman and co-founder, Michael Saylor, has devised a brilliant financial scheme that involves leveraging [Bitcoin](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-market-sees-sell-off-before-fomc-meeting/) investments to transform a $1 income into a whopping $400 million profit. Saylor‚Äôs planned buying binge of 2020 has proven to be incredibly beneficial, yielding significant gains for both the company and himself.

Saylor‚Äôs astute maneuvering involves the pre-planned daily sales of MicroStrategy shares, totaling approximately 5,000 shares. These sales, stemming from options granted in 2014, coincide with MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock surge, which has doubled this year, hitting an all-time high of $1,195. This surge has outpaced even Bitcoin‚Äôs record gains, reflecting investors‚Äô confidence in Saylor‚Äôs leadership and MicroStrategy‚Äôs trajectory.

Investors were concerned that Saylor may sell at the peak, but the performance of MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has calmed their concerns. Saylor has a sizable stake in MicroStrategy, which is evidence of his unshakable commitment to the company‚Äôs long-term success.

Nonetheless, the investment world has expressed dismay over MicroStrategy‚Äôs premium over Bitcoin since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ([ETFs](https://coinedition.com/chinaamcs-bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-excel-iop-totals-142-million/)). Some analysts, including TD Cowen‚Äôs Lance Vitanza, contend that investors‚Äô viewpoints may be obscured by media attention, highlighting Saylor‚Äôs decision to hold onto MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock.

Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wonders why investors would pay a premium for MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock when there are easily accessible Bitcoin ETFs. His comparison of MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock to a ‚Äúretail magical believing stock‚Äù suggests that the company‚Äôs valuation may be more influenced by sentiment than by fundamentals.

Acquired as a hedge against inflation, MicroStrategy now has more than $13.5 billion in Bitcoin assets. Still, despite the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin, the company lost $53 million in the first quarter of operations. This loss, which is the outcome of accounting standards, emphasizes the difficulties involved in valuing digital assets on financial accounts.

Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer of Arca, sums up Saylor‚Äôs strategy for MicroStrategy this way: employing loan or equity to buy Bitcoin, which increases MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock price and permits future acquisitions.

With Bitcoin, which is currently trading [$56,959.62](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) with a decrease of 8.62% in the last 24 hours, its price volatility has brought attention to MicroStrategy‚Äôs investment method and the ways that the relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets is changing.

*   **Pike Finance has suffered a second attack in three days.**
*   **The first attack happened on April 26.**
*   **Both attacks are related to the same vulnerability.**

Pike Finance has suffered a second exploit in under a week, losing over a million in assorted cryptos across the [Ethereum](https://dailycoin.com/ethereum-eth/), Arbitrum, and Optimism chains.

The Circle-backed [decentralized finance](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-defi-mysteries-of-decentralized-finance/) (DeFi) protocol suffered the first attack on April 26, two days after it enabled USDC withdrawals via the CCTP protocol. Acknowledging that it lost 299,127 USDC in the aftermath, Pike Finance said the attack was due to a ‚ÄúUSDC withdrawal vulnerability.‚Äù

**Hackers Exploit ‚ÄòUSDC Vulnerability‚Äô for the Second Time**
------------------------------------------------------------

On May 1, Pike Finance [alerted](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) the X (Twitter) crypto community to the second attack, noting that ‚Äúthis exploit is related to the initial USDC vulnerability reported last week on the 26th of April.‚Äù

Per the alert, Pike Finance upgraded the spoke contracts and included an additional dependency within the smart contract code to pause the protocol following the first exploit. The dependency introduced new variables, resulting in the position occupied by the \*initialized\* variable being taken by other variables.

The protocol said this led to a ‚Äúmisalignment in storage mapping.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis misalignment caused the contract to behave as if it was uninitialized, since the \*initialized\* variable could no longer be accessed. As a result, attackers were then able to upgrade the spoke contracts, bypassing admin access, and as a result, withdraw funds,‚Äù the protocol wrote.

The exploit resulted in the theft of over $1.6 million cryptos, including 99,970.48 ARB, 64,126 OP, and 479.39 ETH. Pike Finance offered a 20% reward for the return of the funds as it pursues an investigation.

Suspect stole 40,000 STRK tokens before cashing out to USDT
-----------------------------------------------------------

Chinese authorities have apprehended a suspect, identified as Lan Mou, for alleged identity forgery related to the StarkNet (STRK) airdrop. The suspect was arrested in the Guangdong Province on April 25, along with a computer and two mobile phones.

According to an April 30 [local media report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572), Lan Mou assumed other people‚Äôs identities and submitted over 40 false Early Community Member Program (ECMP) airdrop forms, claiming more than 40,000 STRK tokens that initially belonged to the victims. Following the airdrop, the suspect transferred the stolen STRK tokens to an OKX wallet and converted them to over $91,000 worth of Tether (USDT).

While scams and phishing attacks are common in the cryptocurrency space, identity theft on such a large scale for claiming other users‚Äô airdrops appears to be an unprecedented occurrence.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The [StarkNet Foundation](https://cryptobriefing.com/starknet-foundation-confirms-1-8-billion-strk-token-rollout/), the organization supporting the Ethereum layer-2 Starknet network, launched a 700 million STRK token airdrop on Feb. 20 to reward Ethereum solo and liquid stakers, Starknet developers and users, as well as projects and developers outside the Web3 ecosystem. The airdrop generated significant interest, with the first 45 million STRK tokens being claimed in less than 90 minutes.

However, the STRK airdrop was not without controversy. On Feb. 20, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg warned that the StarkNet‚Äôs eligibility list primarily included airdrop squatters, or professional airdrop hunters, who only farm protocols with an incoming airdrop in hopes of financial gains.

Banteg alleged that approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop squatters seeking to compound their rewards.

This incident is not the first time airdrop hunters have exploited token distributions. In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from the [Arbitrum](https://cryptobriefing.com/arbitrum-atlas-upgrade/) (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets under their control.

Markdown Content:
In Guangdong province, China‚Äôs authorities have arrested a person who manipulated the process of identity verification to claim StarkNet (STRK) airdrop rewards illegally.¬†

The suspect, Lan Mou, employed false identities to enroll in StarkNet‚Äôs Early Community Member Program (ECMP) more than forty times and illegally collected over 40,000 STRK tokens, according to a [local report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572).

Subsequently, these tokens were moved to an OKX wallet and changed to Tether for an aggregate sum exceeding $91,000. The arrest was made on April 25, and a computer and two mobile phones supposedly employed in the scheme were taken by the police.

StarkNet‚Äôs Airdrop and Eligibility Issues
-----------------------------------------

StarkNet, an [Ethereum](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/ethereum-eth/) layer-2 scaling solution, [started an airdrop of 700 million](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/starknet-fixes-immutable-ethereum-stakers/) STRK tokens on February 20 towards Ethereum stakers, developers, and other contributors within the Web3 space. The project sought to recognize the active part of the community and to strengthen the network development. However, the distribution was fraught with several obstacles as it became interesting to airdrop squatters‚Äîpeople who create many accounts to claim a huge amount of tokens. Banteg, a developer from Yearn.Finance pointed out these problems a few days after the airdrop, including the fact that many of the 1.3 million eligible addresses are associated with suspicious Github profiles.

Precedents of Airdrop Misuse
----------------------------

The misuse of airdrops has been around in the cryptocurrency industry for quite some time. [In March](https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1639165562663358466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), the same tactics were seen in the case of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop. The airdrop hunters moved tokens of value $3.3 million from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets. Such events represent persisting weaknesses in digital token airdrops in the areas of identity verification and the prevention of fraudulent claims.

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/resources/spacey-game-guide-7-tips-earn-more-bitcoin-ios-android

Markdown Content:
If you're looking to bank a little bit of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) while playing fun mobile games, there are loads of free [play-to-earn iOS and Android games](https://decrypt.co/205392/bitcoin-booming-you-earn-more-playing-free-games) that pay satoshis (1/100,000,000 BTC) while you play and view ads. Not all of them are worth the hassle, but we‚Äôve [recommended some that we like](https://decrypt.co/226248/play-games-earn-bitcoin-best-ios-android-games-pay-btc).

One of them is [SpaceY](https://decrypt.co/222699/earn-bitcoin-asteroid-mining-game), an amusing asteroid-mining game from Fumb Games that pays out Bitcoin as you skip across the galaxy to harvest resources. It‚Äôs simple and straightforward, but there‚Äôs a bit of strategy in the mix‚Äîways to boost your earnings by taking advantage of every opportunity that pops up along the way.

Unlike Fumb‚Äôs own [Bitcoin Miner](https://decrypt.co/224183/you-can-earn-real-bitcoin-playing-crypto-mining-game-how-much), SpaceY doesn‚Äôt provide as many direct opportunities to earn more Bitcoin. But if you play smart, you‚Äôll be able to stack up more satoshis without spending any real money. Here are seven tips to help you do just that.

**Tap those satoshis**
----------------------

This is the easiest tip on the list. Every so often, while mining an asteroid, an alert will flash on the screen, and an orange satoshi icon will slowly float along the path between your mining outposts and your space cruiser. You‚Äôll typically have several seconds or more to claim it, so just tap the icon and grab that satoshi.

It might be worth a fraction of a penny‚Äôs worth of Bitcoin, but hey, those satoshis add up over time‚Äîa lot of time.

![Image 1: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips1.png@webp)

Screenshots from SpaceY. Image: Decrypt

**Upgrade your ships**
----------------------

You‚Äôll earn in-game coins for opening the game each day, for mining asteroids, for randomized events that pop up along the way, and for completing other tasks. Those coins will pile up, but there‚Äôs really no reason to sit on them. Instead, use them to upgrade your mining outposts. That will enable your outposts to mine asteroids faster, and each mined asteroid earns you a single satoshi. In other words, better outposts equals more Bitcoin earnings.

There‚Äôs a little bit of strategy to consider here. If you‚Äôre actively playing a lot‚Äîthat is, keeping the game on your screen and playing for more than a moment at a time‚Äîthen you might want a balanced fleet of mining outposts that all pull resources from asteroids at roughly the same rate. But if you‚Äôre someone who will hop in and play for a minute and then come back later, then you may just want to focus on upgrading one or two outposts and making them super efficient.

[You Can Earn Bitcoin for Playing This Asteroid Mining Game‚ÄîHere's How Much](https://decrypt.co/222699/earn-bitcoin-asteroid-mining-game)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asteroid mining could be big business in the future, if anyone figures out how to make it economically feasible. For now, at least, you can mine Bitcoin from digital space rocks in the mobile game SpaceY. And yes, you really can cash out the BTC that you earn. SpaceY‚Äîno, not SpaceX‚Äî is a simple, straightforward idle mining game in which you‚Äôll guide the adventures of a crew aboard a space freighter as it hops across the galaxy, looking for Bitcoin, and sucking dry whatever resources you can find...

**Claim the daily reward**
--------------------------

Playing daily is the best way to maintain earning momentum in SpaceY, as there‚Äôs a daily login reward‚Äîand the rewards get better with each consecutive day you play. While you won‚Äôt directly get any free Bitcoin from these rewards, you can get a huge stash of in-game coins, purple ‚Äúcredits‚Äù that you can use to buy coins and other boosts, as well as boxes that contain powerful augments to improve your mining outposts. These will all help you earn more BTC.

![Image 2: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips2.png@webp)

**Use your augments**
---------------------

Augments are upgrades that can supercharge your mining outposts, improving their mining speed and efficiency along with other stats. And there are multiple levels of augments, ranging from a puny 2% improvement to a massive 1,000% boost. Make sure that you not only use the augments you have to improve your ships but also actively try to gain more.

You can unlock more augments by spending the purple credits you amass over time to buy boxes of augments in the shop. You can also trade up multiple lesser augments to unlock more powerful ones. The advantages can be huge, so don‚Äôt overlook this feature.

[Play Games, Earn Bitcoin: The Best iOS and Android Games That Pay You BTC](https://decrypt.co/226248/play-games-earn-bitcoin-best-ios-android-games-pay-btc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that there are mobile games that pay real Bitcoin for playing? These are legit games that you can download from the iOS App Store or Android Play Store, and as you play the game and watch ads between rounds or levels, you‚Äôll stack up satoshis (aka the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin). Granted, you‚Äôll need to keep your expectations in check‚Äîmost of these games pay out something in the ballpark of a few cents worth of Bitcoin per hour of play. Nobody‚Äôs going to get rich playing a B...

**Pursue the alerts**
---------------------

Every so often, a red ‚Äúalert‚Äù button will flash on the screen. Tapping that reveals some sort of story prompt‚Äîfor example, a civilian ship is being attacked by raiders, or you‚Äôve encountered a cluster of asteroids and meteors that could be mined. Take ‚Äòem or leave ‚Äòem.

Sometimes you‚Äôll earn rewards from engaging with these‚Äîsuch as coins or augments. Sometimes you won‚Äôt earn anything. But there‚Äôs no apparent downside to engaging with these pop-up prompts. Even if the text says that the attempt went awry or that ships were destroyed in the process, we‚Äôve never seen any tangible downside represented in the game. So even if they‚Äôre random and repetitive, you might as well engage with them and hope for rewards.

[You Can Earn Real Bitcoin for Playing This Crypto Mining Game‚ÄîHere's How Much](https://decrypt.co/224183/you-can-earn-real-bitcoin-playing-crypto-mining-game-how-much)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve covered a lot of mobile games that pay players Bitcoin rewards, but Bitcoin Miner is the most literal interpretation we‚Äôve seen to date: You‚Äôre mining fake cryptocurrency in this iOS and Android game, but can cash out real Bitcoin. As Decrypt‚Äôs GG recently reported, Bitcoin Miner first launched several years ago without real BTC earnings baked in, and it went nowhere. But once Fumb Games tried implementing the ability to earn and cash out satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,00...

**Watch the ads**
-----------------

Unlike in [Bitcoin Miner](https://decrypt.co/resources/bitcoin-miner-game-guide-earn-more-btc-ios-android), the ads in SpaceY are entirely optional‚Äîat least as of this writing. That‚Äôs much different than most of these play-to-earn Bitcoin games. But as with most free-to-play mobile games, there are real advantages to watching the video ads. And if you can stomach them, then you can make some serious progress here by watching them.

Why watch the video ads in SpaceY? Doing so can supercharge a boost that speeds up your mining capabilities, for example, or double the rewards you earn when logging in. Sometimes, watching an ad will also earn you VIP points, which can be spent to buy larger-scale game upgrades‚Äîsuch as boosting the number of coins earned while you‚Äôre offline, or extending how long the ‚Äúx2 Speed‚Äù perks last.

![Image 3: Screenshots from SpaceY](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spacey-tips3.png@webp)

**Start over‚Äîno, really!**
--------------------------

This might not seem logical, but SpaceY gives you the option to essentially start the game over and go back to the first sector, keeping _some_ of the benefits you‚Äôve amassed on your journey while significantly boosting your in-game coin earnings. It‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúTemporal Jump,‚Äù and is akin to a ‚ÄúNew Game+‚Äù mode in some video games.

While it‚Äôs true that you‚Äôll have to start the quest over again and replay past sectors, the truth is that every sector in the game (that we‚Äôve played, at least) is more or less the same, aside from minor variables. You‚Äôre probably not going to be playing this game to explore the galaxy; you‚Äôre playing it because it‚Äôs a simple, fun diversion that pays you a bit of Bitcoin along the way. You‚Äôll earn Bitcoin faster by triggering this Temporal Jump every so often.

*   **Ver‚Äôs journey reflects the tension between principles of decentralization and personal gain.**
*   **His involvement with Ripple and Bitcoin Cash sparked regulatory challenges and community discord.**

Among the wild history of Bitcoin, there are few figures who had provoked as many debates and controversies as Roger Ver. David ‚ÄúJoelKatz‚Äù Schwartz, CTO at Ripple, has pointed that both he was both acclaim and censure. .¬†

From his early days as a vocal supporter bitcoins to the later controversies with Ripple and Bitcoin Cash, his journeys mirror the complexities and conflicts that lie in the journey of Digital currencies.

&gt; I happen to run into a bitcoin OG just a few weeks ago and we started talking about Roger Ver. I won't mention who, but they can out themselves in this thread if they want to.
&gt; 
&gt; I shared two things about Roger. He's one of the nicest and most genuine people I've ever met. And he‚Ä¶

Ver‚Äôs backers describe him as a skilled visionary businessman and resolute protector of personal freedoms. They praise his early advocacy for Bitcoin, indicating that he was instrumental in its adoption, and his clear principles of decentralization and personal sovereignty.However, the critics draw a different picture, holding him responsible for promotion of divisive agendas and engaging in questionable practices which are breeding the unnecessary fractures within the community.

Central to the debate surrounding Ver is the perception of his moral compass and ethical conduct. Others hail him as a principled custodian of economic liberty, while others go to the extent of [criticizing](https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1785532239700517157) him as one who puts individual interest above those of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This contradiction therefore emphasizes the complexities of the intersection of ideology, self-interest, and the quest for technological innovations in the digital era.

One recurring point of contention is Ver‚Äôs involvement with Ripple, a venture that has drawn scrutiny from regulators and industry observers alike. While Ver‚Äôs support for Ripple may have been rooted in a genuine belief in its potential to revolutionize financial systems, critics argue that his association with the project contributed to early regulatory challenges for Bitcoin and fueled perceptions of opportunism.

In addition to that, Ver‚Äôs active participation in the contentious fork that resulted in the emergence of Bitcoin Cash has widened the gaps within the community. While some consider Bitcoin Cash as a real alternative with its own distinct value proposition, others see it as a ploy to seize control of the brand for [personal gains](https://x.com/topcointrader/status/1785530654102352187).The debate over Ver‚Äôs motivations and intentions continues to shape narratives surrounding his legacy within the cryptocurrency sphere.

URL Source: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T11:42:48Z

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a significant drop, falling to $56,556 during Wednesday morning in Europe, marking the lowest point since late February. This downturn represents the sharpest monthly decline since November 2022, with BTC tumbling approximately 7.5% within the last 24 hours and breaching the previously stable $60,000 support late Tuesday.

#1 Derisking Before Today‚Äôs FOMC Meeting
----------------------------------------

Anticipation and anxiety are high in financial circles as the [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/) is set to announce its interest rate decision later today. This event is crucial as the crypto market, notably Bitcoin, has grown increasingly reactive to macroeconomic signals.

Recent data, reflecting a slowdown in GDP growth coupled with persistent inflation, has significantly reduced expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. ‚ÄúBitcoin and other risk assets are currently feeling the pressure from a stagflationary environment, geopolitical tensions, and seasonal liquidity variations,‚Äù [remarked](https://talkingmacro.com/research/may-fomc-meeting-preview-2024-05-01) Ted from TalkingMacro.

Initially, up to seven rate cuts were anticipated by the end of 2024, a sentiment that has shifted dramatically with the market now pricing in only one potential cut by December 2024. This shift comes amidst an environment where inflation data is trending upwards, challenging the Federal Reserve‚Äôs position and potentially leading to a more cautious approach from Jerome Powell, the Fed Chairman.

‚ÄúFor the first time in recent memory, the market is calling the Fed‚Äôs bluff, quickly front-running the idea that the Fed may not cut at all in 2024,‚Äù noted Ted.

### #2 Cyclical Bitcoin Correction Phase

Following an exceptional rally since the year‚Äôs start, the market is undergoing a natural correction phase. Prior to the price crash, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, [noted](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/if-history-rhymes-bitcoin-price-next-6-months/): ‚ÄúWe are a day short of breaking the record set in 2011 for days without a meaningful dip \[-25%\],‚Äù emphasizing the extraordinary nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance. [![Image 3: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=898067)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1897421&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=378944&amp;banID=519875620&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1827585&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714567974762437&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons%2F&amp;hc=4ca35a1e32b658464542fc6104ec9a6e31812059&amp;location=)

Scott Melker, known as ‚ÄúThe Wolf Of All Streets,‚Äù highlighted technical indicators that suggested an impending correction. ‚ÄúBroke and retested range lows as resistance. \[‚Ä¶\] My biggest concern I have been discussing for months \[was\] that RSI never made the trip to oversold. Almost there now, all lower time frames oversold. This is still ONLY A 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.‚Äù &gt; [$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Daily

### #3 Profit-Taking

Traditional finance markets and seasoned investors are seizing the opportunity to take profits following substantial gains. ‚ÄúTradFi/Boomers are taking profits: [CME Open Interest](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/cme-overtakes-binance-in-bitcoin-futures-crypto-investments/) is decreasing rapidly, April 29th 135,6k coins, April 30th 123,9k coins, topped around 170.4k coins (March 20th),‚Äù explained crypto analyst RunnerXBT.

[![Image 4: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374570&amp;setID=452519&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293220&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714567974999843&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-price-dips-below-57000-4-key-reasons%2F&amp;hc=3f52ad1e25eead94acc7d3498f79cf6ca28b44cc&amp;location=)

This trend confirms a broader profit-taking strategy post significant events like the ETF approval and the anticipation around the [Bitcoin halving](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/). ‚ÄúThat \[‚Ä¶\] confirms my thesis that a lot of these guys longed in October 2023 because of ETF approval and BTC halving, trade played out and now they are taking profits (yes they are still up a lot), because they longed BTC not dead altcoins.‚Äù &gt; TradFi/Boomers are taking profits ‚úÖ &gt; &gt; CME Open Interest is decreasing rapidly &gt; April 29th 135,6k coins &gt; April 30th 123,9k coins &gt; &gt; Topped around 170.4k coins (March 20th) &gt; &gt; That at least for me confirms my thesis that a lot of these guys longed in October 2023 because of ETF approval‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/M8KY1NfCtK](https://t.co/M8KY1NfCtK)

### #4 US ETF Flows And Hong Kong Disappointment

The dynamics surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs have shown significant strains, evidenced by recent activities in both US and Hong Kong markets. In the United States, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced substantial outflows, indicating a cooling investor sentiment.

According to recent [data](https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1785534412383224038), the total outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $161.6 million. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced outflows of $93.2 million, while Fidelity and Bitwise registered outflows of $35.3 million and $34.3 million, respectively. BlackRock had zero net flows once again. These numbers suggest a retreat in institutional interest, which has traditionally been a bulwark against price volatility.

Parallel to the US, the debut of [Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/spot-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-approved-hong-kong/) also faltered significantly below expectations. Six newly launched ETFs, intended to capture both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, collectively reached just $11 million in trading volume, starkly underperforming against the anticipated $100 million. The spot Bitcoin ETFs accounted for $8.5 million in trading volume. This was markedly lower than the launch day volumes of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had reached $655 million on their first day.

### #5 Long Liquidations

The market has also been impacted by substantial long liquidations, with a total of $451.28 million liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. The largest single liquidation was an ETH-USDT-SWAP on OKX valued at $6.07 million, but Bitcoin-specific liquidations were significant as well, totaling $143.04 million, according to [data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from CoinGlass. These liquidations have amplified the selling pressure on Bitcoin.

At press time, BTC traded at $57,715.

Crypto market sinks ahead of Fed decision on interest rates
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the lead-up to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, investor pessimism has significantly impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

As of the time of writing, BTC has dropped 7.6%, and ETH is down 6% over the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin price is currently hovering around $57,000, while the Ethereum price is stuck at just under $2,900, according to data from CoinGecko.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The volatility has been particularly challenging for derivatives traders, with $457 million worth of crypto futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. Unsurprisingly, $392 million of those liquidations were long contracts, where traders had placed bets on future price increases.

The sagging prices have been widespread throughout the market, with few assets in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinGecko escaping the sea of red, aside from stablecoins that have managed to maintain their pegs, such as [Tether (USDT) and Circle‚Äôs USDC](https://cryptobriefing.com/usdc-overtakes-usdt-transaction-volume/).

The US Federal Open Markets Committee is set to publish its interest [rate decision](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) at 2 PM (Eastern Time) today, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 PM. In February, investors seemed certain that May would be the month the [FOMC finally cut interest rates](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-faces-key-resistance-fomc-meeting/), which is typically a bullish sign for risk assets like Bitcoin. Lower interest rates usually encourage traders to move out of US Treasuries and chase gains in riskier assets, such as equities and crypto assets.

However, the Fed‚Äôs key interest rate currently stands at a high of 5.25% to 5.5% and has been unchanged since July 2023 as the central bank aims to curb inflation. Policymakers have been closely monitoring inflation, which is currently at 3.5%, hoping to bring it closer to 2% before considering rate reductions. Last month, inflation increased to its highest level since September, making the prospect of rate cuts more distant.

In March, the Swiss Central Bank announced it was cutting interest rates, providing some hope for traders. However, this sentiment hasn‚Äôt spread to other major central banks. Months prior, traders [seemed certain](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-fomc-market-watch/) that the Fed might lower interest rates in June, according to the [CME Fed Watch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). Sentiment has since soured, with more expectation surrounding the Fed not easing out interest rates until at least the end of this year.

At the time of writing, total crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours stand at $447.3 million, with $377 million worth of long positions liquidated. $142.5 million worth of long positions on Bitcoin were liquidated.

Total trading volumes in the past 24 hours increased by 49.6% to $103.6 billion, while¬†Bitcoin trading volumes in the past 24 hours increased by 61.3%.

**Santiment** [data](https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1785183439286882449) suggests that traders should watch for a spike in volume as a potential turnaround signal for a market-wide rally heading into May. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs trading volume has dropped by 60%-65% since its peak in late February.

**InvestAnswers**, a popular trader, [pointed out](https://twitter.com/invest_answers/status/1785605068030660824) that despite the drop and massive ETF selling, a whale accumulated 1,200 BTC worth $68 million, which is three times the daily issuance. The trader also noted that a typical bull run has two 20-30% dips, and the current 23% retrace from all-time high levels is not unusual.

IntoTheBlock data highlights that transactions greater than¬†100,000 surged from 8,519 on April 29 to 11,160 on April 30, with large transaction volumes widening by 21.3% to¬†57.4 billion.

**Recent data highlights a significant downturn in the open interest of major cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), [Solana](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/) ([SOL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/)), and Ripple (XRP).**

With a combined drop of 51%, these altcoins spark debate over the implications for their future market positions.

Open Interest Declines Across the Crypto Market
-----------------------------------------------

Open interest, a crucial indicator of market sentiment and liquidity, reflects the total value of outstanding [futures](https://beincrypto.com/learn/cryptocurrency-futures-where-to-trade-them/) contracts yet settled. For cryptocurrencies, these metrics provide insights into investor behavior and market dynamics.

Dogecoin led the recent decline, with its open interest plummeting by 64% to $668.2 million since the start of April. Solana and XRP also witnessed considerable reductions, decreasing by 47% to $1.51 billion and 44% to $497.67 million, respectively.

This widespread decline compate with the open interest levels of Bitcoin, which has dropped to those observed during the FTX collapse, further intensifying concerns about the broader state of the crypto market.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe Open Interest Oscillator has cooled down significantly from the peak of 73K, currently at -15%. Normally, a rally starts from the lower bounds, but in our case, it is hindered by the pressure from bearish market orders.‚Äù Axel, a verified analyst from CryptoQuant,¬†[stated](https://twitter.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1785555494133735769).

The sharp drop in Dogecoin‚Äôs open interest suggests a pullback in trading activity and potentially diminished investor confidence. This is corroborated by Dogecoin‚Äôs market performance, where it continues to trade near the lower end of its short-term range.

Such trends often signal consolidation phases, which could precede further losses unless there is a significant uptick in buyer engagement.

Solana‚Äôs situation reveals similar challenges. Apart from its falling open interest, the network saw a drastic 95% decrease in its monthly transaction volume, falling to $7.32 trillion in April from much higher levels in March. The declining network activity and bearish technical patterns suggest that [Solana may struggle](https://beincrypto.com/sol-death-cross-decline/) to regain its previous highs.

XRP‚Äôs open interest scenario is slightly different, given [the recent whale activity](https://beincrypto.com/xrp-whales-initiating-recovery/) involving the transfer of 29 million XRP tokens from Bitstamp to an undisclosed [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/). While such movements have historically been precursors to price surges, reliance on a single event for market prediction is precarious.

Moreover, the ongoing legal tussle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission over XRP‚Äôs status as a [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) continues to loom over its market prospects, casting uncertainty on its potential recovery.

Despite these challenges, the possibility of a sudden reversal exists, particularly for XRP. Reduced leveraged positions might hint at short-term selling pressure. Still, the dominance of perpetual contracts in its open interest composition allows room for swift price changes if buying activity resumes.

The excitement surrounding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suffered a significant setback in April, coinciding with the decline in the cryptocurrency's price. New U.S. ETFs experienced net outflows of $343.5 million, ending a streak of three-month inflows.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness $344 Million Net Withdrawals in April
---------------------------------------------------------------

ETFs had previously experienced significant inflows, attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion and $4.6 billion in demand in January, February and March, respectively.

However, overall flows have slowed significantly since peaking at $1.05 billion in daily net inflows on March 12.

This slowdown was accompanied by an 18% decline in Bitcoin's value, which fell from its all-time high of $73,650 on March 14 by the end of April.

April's outflows were led by Grayscale's high-fee GBTC fund, which saw $2.5 billion in outflows during the month. Ark Invest's ARKB experienced monthly net outflows of $86.3 million, while Valkyrie's BRRR also recorded small net outflows of $0.3 million.

Although Fidelity's FBTC and Bitwise's BITB also saw their first daily outflows in April, the remaining funds recorded net inflows last month.

BlackRock's IBIT continued to dominate net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, taking in $1.5 billion through April.

This was followed by $556.1 million for Fidelity's FBTC and $125 million for Bitwise's BITB. However, the 71-day inflow streak that propelled IBIT into the top ten ETFs of all time ended on April 23. Since then, the fund has seen zero flows for five consecutive days.

Ark Invest's ARKB was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to record net inflows on Tuesday, adding $3.6 million.

Meanwhile, outflows from Grayscale's GBTC ($93.2 million), Fidelity's FBTC ($35.3 million) and Bitwise's BITB ($34.3 million) were at 161,000 for the day. It contributed to a net outflow of $6 million.

Total net inflows into the combined US spot Bitcoin ETFs were $11.8 billion, falling below $12 billion since trading began Jan. 11.

Daily trading volume for ETFs has also fallen significantly after hitting a record $9.9 billion on March 5, when Bitcoin surpassed its previous cycle peak of around $69,000 for the first time. The trading volume recorded on Tuesday was $2.9 billion.

Federal Judge Sentences Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao to Jail
--------------------------------------------------------------

Binance's founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao is sentenced to four months in jail by Federal Judge Richard Jones in the Western District Court of Washington. It's worth noting that the judge imposed this sentence for violating American money laundering laws.¬†  

However, the prosecution had recommended a three-year sentence for CZ for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at the [crypto exchange](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-joins-hands-with-bouncebit-a-btc-restaking-chain"cryptoexchange"). Yet, in court, Judge Jones stated that there was no evidence that Changpeng Zhao was ever informed about any illicit activities taking place at Binance. Thus, dismissing the prosecutor's request to extend CZ's sentence to three years from the initial 18 months.

The prosecution argued that a jail sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense related to AML violations. Otherwise, it would only encourage further breaches of the law. Following this, CZ was sentenced to four months in jail.

### Changpeng Zhao Apologized Before Sentencing

Changpeng Zhao sought forgiveness for his actions, admitting that he had plenty of time to think and react. He acknowledged responsibility for [Binance's](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-is-back-in-india-after-paying-dollar2-million-fine"Binance's") failure to implement an effective AML program. It's noteworthy that after being sentenced to four months in jail, CZ stated that he would report to jail on the designated date. Currently, Changpeng Zhao is out on bail, amounting to $175 million, but with the court's decision to sentence him to four months in jail, he will be placed in police custody. This is where CZ will serve his jail term.

It's important to recall that on November 21, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was found guilty of failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws in his exchange. Consequently, he had to resign from his position as CEO of Binance. This settlement, part of the ongoing investigation into Binance by US regulators, involved a $4.3 billion payment made by Binance to resolve the probe.

In light of these developments, the cryptocurrency community is closely observing the implications of CZ's sentencing on Binance's operations and the broader crypto market. Some speculate that this could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny on other crypto exchanges and projects. Others are concerned about the impact on Binance's reputation and its ability to maintain its position as one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally.

#### Conclusion

According to Coin Gabbar, Changpeng Zhao's sentencing marks a significant event in the intersection of cryptocurrency and regulation. It underscores the importance of adhering to regulatory standards in the rapidly evolving crypto industry and the potential consequences for those who fail to do so. As the crypto market continues to mature, such legal actions are likely to become more common as regulators worldwide seek to ensure compliance and protect investors.

Efforts to push through [U.S. stablecoin legislation](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38431860/maxine-waters-says-stablecoin-bill-in-the-short-run-coming) by attaching it to an unrelated Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill have been halted by legislative leaders.

**What Happened**: The decision to seek a clean bill means the discussion between House Financial Services Committee Chair **Patrick McHenry** (R-N.C.) and Rep. **Maxine Waters** (D-Calif.) will revert to direct negotiations on a comprehensive agreement, the aide noted, preferring anonymity due to the private nature of the talks, Coindesk [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/stablecoin-bill-unlikely-to-get-pinned-to-faa-reauthorization-putting-effort-on-hold-again/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines).

This development underscores the seriousness of the legislative push for stablecoin oversight, with significant discussions involving key Senate members for the first time.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman **Sherrod Brown** (D-Ohio) has expressed willingness to combine stablecoin regulations with legislation facilitating financial services for the cannabis industry.

However, Senate Majority Leader **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.) supports this plan, while Minority Leader **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.) remains opposed.

The scenario suggests that stablecoin regulation may resurface in other crucial legislative processes, potentially linked with cannabis banking reforms.

‚ÄúThis push will demonstrate the level of Congressional support for these measures and identify the opposition,‚Äù **Jaret Seiberg**, a TD Cowen analyst, commented in a research note.

He anticipates that the real legislative efforts will intensify later in the year.

Previously, an infrastructure bill unexpectedly carried significant crypto regulations, illustrating that the legislative vehicle for stablecoin and potentially cannabis banking reforms might also be unconventional.

Yet, a final compromise on the stablecoin legislation that satisfies all parties has not been reached, causing industry insiders to remain cautious.

**Kristin Smith**, CEO of the **Blockchain Association**, emphasized the importance of the legislative details.

‚ÄúWe look forward to reviewing and providing feedback on any new compromise drafts that might emerge,‚Äù she said.

With several lawmakers having strong motivations to advance a stablecoin bill, the outcome could significantly impact their political careers.

‚ÄúBrown is particularly motivated to advance the SAFER Banking Act before his challenging re-election bid, aiming for a legislative win on the popular issue of cannabis reform,‚Äù

**Beacon Policy Advisors** noted in their analysis, also highlighting that this is a defining issue for the retiring McHenry.

**What‚Äôs Next:** This legislative drama unfolds as the digital assets industry continues to gain prominence, a topic that will undoubtedly be a point of discussion at Benzinga‚Äôs upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19, where the future of regulations and their impact on the industry will be key themes.

Despite BENJI‚Äôs innovative approach, BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL has swiftly ascended to the top, highlighting the rapid adoption and potential of blockchain within mainstream financial services.

[BlackRock CEO Larry Fink advocates for tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-larry-fink-bitcoin-ethereum-tokenization/) of real-world assets. He believes that on-chain implementations can bring more efficiency to capital markets. This sentiment resonates with the broader trend of asset [tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-tokenization/), which now extends beyond government securities to include stocks and real estate.

Although the general demand for these tokenized products remains in its nascent stages, specific segments, as exemplified by BUIDL, show promising interest. Wan points out that liquidity remains a primary concern for potential investors in tokenized equities, funds, or bonds.

&gt; ‚ÄúEven if the end investors are crypto natives, they would be reluctant to invest in tokenized equities given the thin liquidity. As a result, creates a chicken and egg problem. Issuers don‚Äôt see a clear benefit in tokenizing their assets on-chain with low-demand,‚Äù Wan said.

Published Time: 2024-05-01T07:30:52-05:00

Markdown Content:
In a searing critique, John E. Deaton, a prominent legal advocate for XRP, has issued a forceful condemnation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, accusing him of undermining ethical standards and fostering an environment of deceit at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Deaton‚Äôs allegations emerged following a statement by Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, asserting that Gensler had misled Congress during his testimonies, particularly concerning the regulatory status of Ether as a security. McHenry‚Äôs statement reflects a broader concern about potential misrepresentations and obfuscations by the SEC which, according to him, indicate a pattern of ‚Äúregulation by enforcement.‚Äù

Deaton Details Gensler‚Äôs ‚ÄòBad Faith‚Äô
------------------------------------

In a [statement](https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1785392734527778824) on X, Deaton directed public attention to his [amicus brief in the Coinbase litigation](https://bitcoinist.com/john-deaton-backs-coinbase-in-with-amicus-brief/), emphasizing its significance in illustrating Gensler‚Äôs questionable regulatory practices. ‚ÄúWith all due respect, it‚Äôs time to serve multiple subpoenas on Gary Gensler and the SEC. I encourage everyone to read the Amicus Brief I filed in the Coinbase case. There‚Äôs a section in the brief proving Gensler is a bad faith regulator who has infected the entire agency,‚Äù Deaton asserted.

The amicus brief itself details accusations against Gensler, presenting a narrative of an SEC that manipulates legal outcomes to fit its agenda, often at the expense of innovation and transparency. Deaton cites multiple instances where federal judges have criticized the SEC for its ‚Äúwin at all costs‚Äù approach.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714568181097619&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fxrp-deaton-sec-gensler-infected-agency%2F&amp;hc=1a0b29f713563c1daf60441f925ee5d0c616bd75&amp;location=)

For example, Judge Netburn in a related XRP lawsuit remarked on the SEC‚Äôs strategy, stating, ‚ÄúShielding the Court from indisputable truths is a win at all costs strategy and another example of the SEC adopting its litigation positions to further its desired goal, and not out of a faithful allegiance to the law.‚Äù

The brief goes further, pointing to specific comments by SEC Commissioner [Hester Peirce](https://bitcoinist.com/sec-commissioner-crypto-regulation-enforcement/), who criticized her own agency‚Äôs approach to regulation. Peirce noted, ‚ÄúInviting people to come in and talk to us only to drag them through a difficult, lengthy, unproductive, and labyrinthine regulatory process casts the Commission in a bad light and thus makes us a less effective regulator.‚Äù

Highlighting the legal and financial ramifications of the SEC‚Äôs actions, Deaton‚Äôs brief references the agency‚Äôs alleged threats to bankrupt companies through litigation‚Äîa claim supported by a declaration from the founder of [LBRY](https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-blasts-sec-millions-wasted/). ‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs objective of bankrupting us through the process, which they threatened privately three years ago, they succeeded,‚Äù stated the founder, whose experience was documented in court filings.

Moreover, the brief critically examines Gensler‚Äôs previous statements, which Deaton argues are contradictory and demonstrate bad faith. Before his tenure at the SEC, Gensler expressed concerns about the lack of regulatory clarity in digital asset markets.

However, as chairman, he has asserted that ‚Äúthe rules related to crypto assets are well-settled‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe test to determine whether a crypto asset is a security is clear,‚Äù remarks made during his speech at the Aspen Security Forum on August 3, 2021.

These contradictions are at the heart of Deaton‚Äôs critique, suggesting a pattern of behavior at the SEC where the truth is less important than the regulatory outcomes the agency seeks to achieve. The brief warns that such behavior not only damages the SEC‚Äôs credibility but also has significant implications for the future of digital asset regulation in the US.

### XRP Lawyer Community Reacts

Meanwhile, other lawyers from the XRP community have criticized McHenry‚Äôs empty words. Marc Fagel, a retired securities lawyer [commented](https://twitter.com/Marc_Fagel/status/1785398868970217817), ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, John. As a lawyer, you know McHenry‚Äôs statement is bogus. The SEC has made no legal determination as to ETH, and GG made no misrepresentations at the hearing. You can disagree with and disdain the guy, but be honest about it.‚Äù

Fred Rispoli, founder of HODL Law [stated](https://twitter.com/freddyriz/status/1785404503262715968) with regards to McHenry, ‚ÄúThis line from your release is inaccurate and/or misleading: ‚ÄúCommittee Republicans will continue to hold Gary Gensler‚Äôs SEC accountable for its regulatory overreach‚Ä¶.‚ÄùRespectfully, sir: How have you held it accountable in the first place? Genuinely want to know.‚Äù

At press time, XRP traded at $0.4881.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-this-the-end-of-bitcoins-bull-run-peter-schiff-thinks-so/

Markdown Content:
Well known for his gold-positive viewpoint, [Peter Schiff](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/schiff-on-bitcoins-stability-as-gold-soars/) recently again underlined his negative viewpoint on Bitcoin. He characterized Bitcoin as entering the ‚Äúdanger zone,‚Äù a critical time because it has been marked down below $60,000. Meanwhile, the $60,000 price level, which was considered a heavy psychological and technical barrier during the 2024 bull run, has proved to be a strong support level. Schiff‚Äôs forecast states that the breach of this point would result in the market changing its current up-trending pattern.

Today, [Bitcoin](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brandts-clashing-bitcoin-predictions-divide/)‚Äòs value stands at $57,501. It tends to maintain proximity with the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). As per Schiff‚Äôs interpretation, failure to sustain a level above the EMA could unfold an adverse trend. The underlying force ends the current rally, which has been taking place over the last year. The scenario is still liquid as the upcoming trading is believed to be of great significance.

![Image 1: a chart showing the price of a stock](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ttc3u1v_KPtugQsHKEwYUUxjjBnypvjDHxwZGaIH3Gx3mQEtPPy7aSgM4_MTevJeiYV_rx16MX6cDm4mvvgIy1X9eL1tJFwlxh-sGUguA1Bl7ia75bVAL3XIbSI-rTjTXMIwFY6SZQcTNPxNvgQoyNs)

The flip side of the coin is that a price fall is usually accompanied by a rise in the volume of trades, which in turn indicates selling pressure has risen. This channel is generally thought to express a bearish trend. This is in line with Schiff‚Äôs concept that supply and demand dynamics change. The behavior of Bitcoin in these times is being traced closely, with a focus on whether the asset can recapture its $60,000 worth.

**Bitcoin nears key $51,965 support level**
-------------------------------------------

Since the recent drop, the market has begun to take a position on the downside of Bitcoin with increased caution. Traders are rightly sizing the fact that it is possible the price has more room to drop. On the technical side, failure to reach the $60,000 level soon can be a precursor to further fall. Support number two will be located at $51,965, which is the range lower. The stock reaching this level of selling price would be a significant decline from the recent levels and may promote further selling.

On the contrary, if Bitcoin rebounds from its current troughs, it must hit the resistance levels at $60k above it to nullify the bearish inclination. If it successfully moves beyond this barrier, it could lead to further exploration of zones as high as $64,000. Such a case would motivate investors who are bullish about Bitcoin.

Among analyst tools are market evaluation instruments. They must watch close changes in the volume and cost direction, as well as the EMA level. These metrics are used to forecast future shifts, and once they have been realized, traders will be able to make sensible decisions in these unpredictable circumstances.

**Potential implications for the crypto market**
------------------------------------------------

Being the bear on Bitcoin, he has accrued a number of followers in discussions about its overall effect on the cryptocurrency market. If, however, this is the case, BTC might drastically have a negative impact on the whole crypto industry. Market players are keeping a close watch on this, with price changes sometimes affecting others quite dramatically.

Volatility is the word which describes the current cryptocurrency conditions and brings new people in because of the chance to make larger profits. As of now, there is a high chance that you might lose the money you invest, so be extremely careful when taking this route. It is recommended that they don‚Äôt lose sight of market moves and catching the technical signals. This is indispensable in order to ensure a smooth operation over obstacles that might show up.

At the end, the Bitcoin crisis and its fall past US$60,000 have increased concerns regarding whether or not BTC will still go upwards in the future. His statements have stressed hazards that in turn have made traders think over safety measures before making any move. The upcoming weeks will be key in assessing whether Bitcoin‚Äôs price is going to jump or fall and, consequently, the state of the global cryptocurrency industry.

The closure of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank marks the inaugural banking failure in the United States for 2024.

This event has ignited discussions within the crypto community, with Bitcoin, Ether, and various altcoins experiencing slight setbacks in the wake of the news.

Macro Taking 'Wind' Out of Crypto: Starkiller's Drogen

[Zesh Marius Martocsan](https://zesh.io/marius-martocsan-building-a-web3-powerhouse/), CEO of X, expressed skepticism towards traditional banking, stating, ‚ÄúAnother bank just collapsed, the Republic First Bank. Yeah‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll stick to Bitcoin.‚Äù

Pillage Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader on X, viewed the failure of Republic First Bank as a significant narrative for crypto, stating, ‚ÄúRepublic First Bank failure is worth a look since bank failures are the best possible narrative we can get for crypto.‚Äù

Randi Hipper, a crypto commentator, posed a thought-provoking question to her 87,100 X followers, asking, ‚ÄúHow many more need to fail before people start to be their own bank?‚Äù

Following the seizure of Republic First by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities on April 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as its receiver.

The FDIC will absorb nearly all deposits and assets of Republic Bank, as outlined in an April 26 statement by the agency.

As of January 31, Republic First possessed approximately $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits.

Subsequently, its 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York will reopen under the umbrella of Fulton Bank on April 27.

The news of Republic First Bank‚Äôs closure follows a challenging year for the banking industry, with FDIC data reporting five banking failures in the U.S. in 2023.

Furthermore, recent history has shown that even rumors of potential banking failures can impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price.

However, in this instance, Bitcoin is down 1.16% and trading at $62,715, while Ether is down 0.58% and trading at $3,095, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Altcoins have experienced a slightly more significant decline, with Dogecoin down 2.88% and Solana down 1.79% in the past hour.

In 2023, the closure of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, among others, underscored the challenges faced by the banking industry.

The collective value of cryptocurrency compromised by hacking plummeted by 67% in April to $60.2 million. This marks a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline this year.

The fall of 67% marks a sharp decline from the $187.6 million hacked in March, which pales in comparison to the $360.8 million worth of hacked digital assets in April, according to a May 1 X [post](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1785631890470572421/photo/1) by on-chain security firm Peckshield.

The monthly total of $60.2 million was stolen from 40 individual hacking incidents. Hacks and exploits have been among the main issues plaguing trust in cryptocurrencies along with mainstream adoption.

The [$44.7 million hack on Hedgey Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedgey-protocol-44-million-exploit), a token infrastructure platform, represented the largest incident in April. The hackers exploited a vulnerability in Hedgey‚Äôs token claim contract on the Arbitrum Network on April 19.

The second-largest hacking incident saw $3 million worth of crypto stolen from the Fixed Float crypto exchange due to a vulnerability with a third-party service provider used by the exchange, according to FixedFloat‚Äôs April 2 X [post](https://twitter.com/FixedFloat/status/1775172224216875223).

The third-largest attack, on Grand Base, netted hackers $2.67 million worth of digital assets, while the fourth-largest [hack, on Pike Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pike-finance-exploited-1-6-million-second-exploit-3-days), resulted in a loss of $1.6 million worth of funds.

Fueling investor concerns, the $1.6 million attack was the second hack suffered by Pike Finance within three days, after a $300,000 exploit on April 26.

The two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract, [according](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to a May 1 X post by Pike Finance.
