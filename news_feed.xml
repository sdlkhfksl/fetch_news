EigenLayer — the largest Ethereum restaking protocol — has received over 12,412 withdrawal requests following widespread disappointment surrounding its planned EIGEN airdrop.

Mass withdrawal requests started on April 29, when EigenLayer saw over 4,336 daily withdrawals, rising to 6,496 on April 30, [according](https://dune.com/queries/3636372/6124104) to Dune data.

The restaking protocol amassed over 12,412 withdrawals in the past three days, which started on April 29 after EigenLayer [released a white paper](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eigenlayer-eigen-whitepaper-bans-airdrop-us-users) on its EIGEN token. However, several jurisdictions were excluded from the airdrop, including the United States, Canada and several African and Asian countries.

EigenLayer has over 107,000 unique depositors, [according](https://dune.com/queries/3592801/6052719) to Dune. In the past three days, the 12,412 withdrawals suggest that 11.6% of unique depositors have withdrawn from the protocol.

While the size of the individual withdrawals can’t yet be traced, the 11.6% of queued withdrawals would reduce EigenLayer’s current $14.8 billion total value locked (TVL) to just above $13 billion.

Since EigenLayer has a seven-day withdrawal processing period, the effects of the mass withdrawals will only become visible in the following weeks.

The ban of key economic jurisdictions from the EigenLayer airdrop has caused widespread disappointment that will affect the protocol’s TVL, according to Anndy Lian, intergovernmental blockchain expert and author of _NFT: From Zero to Hero_. He told Cointelegraph:

&gt; “Participants from these regions might have contributed significantly to EigenLayer’s TVL. Their exclusion could lead to a decrease in the overall TVL, especially if they were actively restaking their assets.”

Airdrop farmers are searching for new restaking protocols
---------------------------------------------------------

EigenLayer’s TVL fell over 4% during the past week, while Karak’s TVL rose 20.5% to $439 million, making it the second-biggest restaking protocol on Ethereum, [according](https://defillama.com/protocols/Restaking) to DefiLlama.

The new restaking protocol’s rapid growth led to speculation that Karak has a “good chance” of [becoming the next EigenLayer](https://cointelegraph.com/news/karak-good-chance-becoming-next-eigenlayer), following the EIGEN airdrop debacle.

Beyond the disappointing airdrop, Karak also introduces technical benefits to users while offering more flexible restaking tokens, according to Lian:

&gt; “Karak introduces unique technical features such as multi-asset restaking and a plug-and-play development environment. These could provide Karak with an edge in attracting developers and users seeking a more versatile restaking platform.”

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) hit fresh multi-month lows on May 1 as market nerves cost traders half a billion dollars.

BTC price rout approaches $57,000
---------------------------------

Data from [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://subscription.cointelegraph.com/) and [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCGBP/?exchange=BINANCE) showed BTC price losses mounting during the Asia session, with BTC/USD hitting $57,082 on Bitstamp.

This marked the pair’s lowest levels since February and took second quarter losses to more than 20%.

Hawkish fiscal policy moves from United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, combined with a [](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-sentence-binance)[legal judgment against crypto exchange Binance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-sentence-binance) and founder Changpeng Zhao, contributed to worsening sentiment across crypto.

Previously, Cointelegraph reported on assumptions that [liquidity would be boosted by Yellen](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bull-market-may-return-after-1-4t-us-liquidity-spike-prediction), who ultimately took steps to achieve the opposite — a setback for risk assets across the board.

“Yellen deciding to pull liquidity from the market, instead of drawing down on reserves to fuel liquidity higher,” financial commentator Tedtalksmacro wrote in part of a [reaction](https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1785463287825735908) on X.

&gt; “Risk appetite takes a hit.”

Even before the downside gathered speed, [warnings were in place](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sub-60k-after-daily-crypto-liquidations-near-300m) for Bitcoin and altcoins, with markets treading water since BTC/USD hitting all-time highs in mid-March.

Now, key support levels were fading, with neither $60,000 nor [short-term holder realized price](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-1-week-lows-us-gdp-stagflation) offering bulls consolation any longer.

“If you must panic, at least wait for the almost two-month old support to breakdown first,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital [told](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785296501708591196) X subscribers the day prior.

Examining the latest events, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, described what he considered to be two paths forward for BTC price trajectory.

“‘Sell in May and go away.’ This looks like distribution to me,” he summarized in an X post.

&gt; “As long as we trade below $61.5K, scenario (1) is technically more likely. A strong reclaim of $61.5K would give some hopes to the bulls for scenario (2). A flush would also be good for the sustaining continuation of the bull market, the sooner we get one, the better the long opportunities are.”

Bitcoin liquidates $160 million in 24 hours
-------------------------------------------

The latest live data from monitoring resource [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) meanwhile put 24-hour crypto liquidations at $470 million at the time of writing.

Bitcoin accounted for $160 million of the total, with Ethereum ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) at $120 million.

The April monthly close, despite coming prior to BTC/USD dipping below $60,000, nonetheless meant that April 2024 was the pair’s worst month since the pit of the [2022 bear market](https://cointelegraph.com/news/worst-month-since-2022-bear-market-5-things-bitcoin-this-week).

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-drops-57000-reversal/

Markdown Content:
**The recent downturn in Bitcoin (BTC) prices has captured the attention of crypto investors, as it currently hovers around $57,000.**

The low is fueled by a sharp reduction in demand, signaling potential shifts in the market sentiments.

Why Bitcoin Price Has Been Falling?
-----------------------------------

Traditionally driven by robust demand from permanent holders and large investors, Bitcoin has seen a stark reversal in this trend. According to a CrytoQuant report shared with BeInCrypto, there has been a dramatic 50% drop in monthly growth from permanent holders.

The demand decreased from over 200,000 BTC in late March to 96,000 BTC currently. Permanent holders are investors who buy to hold and never sell. They are pivotal in maintaining Bitcoin’s market stability.

Similarly, large investors, often called ‘crypto whales,’ have also shown a slowdown in demand. These investors, who typically hold between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, saw their demand growth rate peak at 12% in March. However, the rate has since halved to 6%.

Experts like Matteo Greco, a Research Analyst at Fineqia International, suggest that increased selling pressure, particularly from long-term holders, usually signals a broader market anticipation of a downturn.

Moreover, the decrease in demand is further evident in the sharp reduction of Bitcoin purchases from [spot exchange-traded Funds (ETFs)](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-gold-rival/) in the United States. Following a peak in mid-March, where daily purchases exceeded $1 billion, the current buying rate from these ETFs has dwindled to virtually zero.

[BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-new-board-member-bitcoin-etf/) (IBIT) has reported [no new inflow](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-zero-inflows/) in the past five days, highlighting broader market hesitancy.

Adding to the pressure is an increase in Bitcoin selling by miners. Over the last month, there has been a noticeable rise in daily sales by miners, reaching the highest levels since early January.

This selling activity often indicates [Bitcoin miners’ need to cover operational costs](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-miners-survive-cut/) or take profits, which can exacerbate downward price movements.

Can Bitcoin Find Support at $57,000?
------------------------------------

From a valuation perspective, the immediate future could see Bitcoin prices reversing from the $55,000 to $57,000 range. This projection is based on the short-term holders’ realized price, which falls around $63,000.

&gt; “$55,000 to $57,000 level is 10% below the current realized price of short term holders, which has been the ultimate support for prices during bull markets. Current Bitcoin price is already below short-term holders realized price,” CryptoQuant explained.

Bitcoin’s price movements have historically shown resilience, with reversals occurring around key realized price levels. For instance, in January 2024, [Bitcoin’s price bottomed](https://beincrypto.com/factors-suggest-bitcoin-bottom/) after declining to the short-term holders’ realized price levels, which was around $38,500.

&gt; “During bear markets, the realized price acts as a ceiling, and as a floor in bull markets,” the firm noted.

Thus, investors might anticipate price reversals from the $55,000 to $57,000. Otherwise, the market might enter into a broader downtrend.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/xrp-whales-initiating-recovery/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T08:02:27+00:00

Markdown Content:
**Ripple (XRP) is holding above a critical psychological support level that has been barely invalidated in the last 11 months. At present, it seems like the whales are pushing to prevent this from happening.**

This could be the key to reinitiating a recovery and breaking free from the bearishness XRP has been facing.

Ripple Whales to the Rescue?
----------------------------

Over the past week, the price of XRP has declined from $0.54 to $0.50. This drop has caused the altcoin to lose its support level at $0.51, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level that extends from a high of $0.82 to a low of $0.42. As a result, XRP is now on the brink of falling below the $0.50 mark.

However, the whales seem to have recognized this issue and are likely jumping to prevent this. In the last two days, addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have added over 70 million XRP to their wallets. This supply worth more than $35 million is the largest bout of buying noted in the last three months.

XRP Whale Accumulation. Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/)

Another reason for this accumulation lies in the whales’ intention to make profits. The chances of the XRP price falling below $0.50 are bleak, and the altcoin will likely bounce back. The whales could be making the most of this by buying low and potentially booking profits later.

But this attempt could have a market-wide impact, potentially pushing retail XRP holders to load up as well. Presently, [the Ripple native token](https://beincrypto.com/ripple-cardano-fantom-forbes-zombie-tokens/) is among the few altcoins that have less than 75% of its supply in profit. This is only the second time in nearly a year that the profitable supply has declined to this extent.

Generally, a market top is formed when more than 95% of the circulating supply is noting gains. This means that [XRP still has room for growth](https://beincrypto.com/ripple-hashkey-xrpl-japan-sbi-holdings/), which could serve as a solid incentive for investors to add the token to their wallets.

XRP Price Prediction: Reclaiming Key Support Is Likely
------------------------------------------------------

[XRP price is trading at $0.50](https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-is-primed-for-correction/), just under the resistance of $0.51, coinciding with the 23.6% Fib line. Reclaiming this support is likely given the whales’ bullishness, and it would also support further recovery.

The altcoin has been facing a death cross since mid-April, and to invalidate this, a rise to $0.57 is essential. This price is in confluence with the 38.2% Fib, and reclaiming it would confirm a recovery rally.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/fintopio-ceo-steve-milton-transforming-crypto-payments/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T08:00:00+00:00

Markdown Content:
**In a recent insightful interview with BeInCrypto, Steve Milton, the co-founder and CEO of Fintopio, shared his ambitious plans to revolutionize the cryptocurrency payment industry by focusing on simplicity and user experience.** 

As a seasoned professional with a rich background in Web3, tech, and finance, Milton discussed the unique challenges and opportunities [Fintopio](https://fintopio.com/) is encountering on its innovative journey.

The interview covered a range of topics, from user accessibility to competitive positioning, emphasizing Fintopio’s strategic deployment on Telegram and its aspirations to simplify and democratize crypto payments for the masses.

Fintopio’s DeFi Wallet: Simplifying Crypto for Mass Adoption
------------------------------------------------------------

Fintopio’s introduction of its [DeFi Wallet](https://t.me/fintopio) marks a big milestone in its mission to simplify the [crypto payment](https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-accept-crypto-payments/) process. 

This innovative [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/) allows users to send and receive digital assets directly through Telegram chats, leveraging the app’s massive user base of 900 million monthly active members. [Steve Milton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonsteve/) emphasized the strategic integration, stating, 

&gt; _“We are committed to adopting the straightforward standards common in Web 2.0 payments, which is exactly what we’ve designed Fintopio to offer. Our platform provides easy access and simplifies sending money through chat messaging, significantly lowering the barriers for those who aren’t as technically savvy.”_ 

This approach aligns with Fintopio’s strategy to simplify crypto payments and make access to crypto more accessible, aiming to reach a broader audience beyond the tech-savvy early adopters. Steve Milton articulates this mission clearly: 

&gt; _“Our main goal at Fintopio is democratization of access. We are focused on simplifying and democratizing crypto to foster mass adoption by simplifying the user experience for non-crypto folks,”_ he explains_._ 

By integrating crypto transactions into Telegram, a platform already familiar to millions, Fintopio removes several layers of complexity typically associated with blockchain and digital wallets. The design philosophy behind Fintopio’s wallet focuses on intuitive interfaces that users can navigate with ease, mirroring the simplicity of sending a chat message. 

The unique chat message style UI feature is vital for promoting broad adoption because it removes the substantial entry barriers that have previously discouraged everyday consumers from using blockchain technologies.

Building on Telegram and Strategic Market Positioning
-----------------------------------------------------

Choosing Telegram as the launch platform for the Fintopio [DeFi](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/) Wallet was a strategic decision that leverages the messaging app’s wide reach and technological abilities. 

Telegram is not only one of the most downloaded apps globally but also has a young and technologically adept demographic, which aligns perfectly with Fintopio’s target audience. 

&gt; _“We chose to build on Telegram because it is still growing rapidly and is technologically advanced compared to other platforms,”_ Steve Milton commented on the decision. 

This foundational choice sets the stage for Fintopio to integrate deeply into the daily routines of millions, making the transition to using crypto for payments as smooth as possible.

However, integrating Fintopio’s wallet into Telegram also places it directly in competition not just with Telegram’s primary existing wallet, developed by the TON team, but also with several smaller crypto wallets. 

Despite this competition, Fintopio takes pride in its comprehensive, holistic approach to [financial freedom](https://beincrypto.com/learn/financial-freedom-definition/) via the Fintopio app, which is currently available as a Telegram mini-app and a web-based app, with mobile apps slated for future release. 

Nevertheless, Milton sees this competition as an opportunity rather than a setback. Fintopio’s entry into a market dominated by a well-established competitor drives the company to enhance and innovate its products in order to deliver exceptional value. 

&gt; _“We don’t need to be first to the market; we just need to be better. Our advantage lies in superior technology and user experience, which are crucial for outcompeting others,”_ says Milton. 

This mindset reflects a strategic focus on quality and user satisfaction, which are critical in winning over users who may already be familiar with Telegram’s native wallet.

Moreover, the fact that Fintopio is one of the two wallets [verified](https://t.me/fintopionews) on Telegram adds a layer of trust and legitimacy, setting it apart from numerous unverified alternatives. This verification is vital as it assures users of the safety and reliability of using Fintopio over other options, providing a significant competitive edge. 

By focusing on these strengths, Fintopio aims not only to coexist with existing solutions like Telegram’s wallet but to outperform them by enhancing the user experience and building a strong, secure platform that resonates with the needs and preferences of today’s crypto users.

Steve Milton’s Role at Fintopio
-------------------------------

Thanks to Steve Milton’s strategic direction, Fintopio is well-positioned to disrupt the cryptocurrency payment industry. Milton’s leadership style at Fintopio is influenced by his extensive background in global corporations and his in-depth understanding of Web3 and e-commerce. 

His previous roles at Binance and Shopify gave him a deep understanding of the digital marketplace and consumer behavior, driving Fintopio to prioritize [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/), user experience, and market adaptability.

&gt; _“I’m really keen on disrupting technology, but I’m even more focused on mass adoption of technology. From what I’ve learned in my career, the sweet spot is bringing together great technology, simplicity, and market opportunity. That’s what we aim to achieve at Fintopio,”_ Milton states_._

This philosophy is evident in how Fintopio approaches its product development and market strategy, emphasizing the importance of building a strong and scalable platform. 

Achieving such ambitious goals requires not just good leadership but also a dedicated team that resonates with the company’s mission. 

Milton believes that building such projects demands a special kind of team, one that is as innovative and flexible as the technology they are working with. He emphasizes the importance of diversity in skills and mindset among his team members.

&gt; _“To build something truly revolutionary, you need team members who are not just experienced in the crypto space but who are also ready to challenge norms and think independently. Our team’s ability to adapt and embrace a fluid working environment is crucial,”_ Milton elaborates_._

Vision and Future Directions of Fintopio
----------------------------------------

As Fintopio continues to innovate within the cryptocurrency payment sector, its long-term ambitions extend beyond the current functionalities of its [DeFi](https://beincrypto.com/learn/decentralized-finance-and-use-cases/) Wallet. Steve Milton envisions a broad expansion of services that will integrate more seamlessly with various messaging and social media platforms. 

&gt; _“Fintopio is not just targeting to be a Telegram bot; we’re already working on Android and iOS apps and have a web app. Our aim is to make sending payments as simple as sending a chat message, which will appeal broadly to users accustomed to mobile communication.”_

Beyond this, Fintopio is setting its sights on expanding into Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Fiat payments, aiming to become a comprehensive financial infrastructure that bridges various payment methodologies.

The drive towards integrating payment features into major social media and messaging platforms recognizes the shifting dynamics of the fintech and crypto solutions sectors. 

With the global volume of cashless payment services expected to surge in the coming years, Fintopio is well-positioned to tap into this growth by providing innovative solutions that cater to an increasingly digital and mobile-first consumer base.

URL Source: https://cryptopotato.com/best-solana-dex/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T09:00:43+00:00

Markdown Content:
The Solana blockchain is home to hundreds of decentralized applications (dApp) that leverage the blockchain’s high throughput, scalability, and composability.

There’s a reason it’s one of the largest DeFi ecosystems, with billions in total value locked.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) underpin this bustling community and account for the lion’s share of the TVL on Solana. They provide users with the necessary tools to trade on-chain, swap between different tokens, offer liquidity, and much more.

In the following, we attempt to provide comprehensive information on the best Solana DEXs, including important information about their protocols, but also:

*   Key features
*   Trading fees: critical detail when trading on-chain
*   Supported self-custody wallets and more

Solana has several aspects that make it an ideal chain for DEXs. It has given birth to some of the best-known decentralized trading platforms, not just within its own ecosystem but within the entire industry.

Should You Trade on a DEX?
--------------------------

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer several advantages over traditional exchanges, like enhanced privacy and autonomy, as well as access to a broader range of tokens.

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs are non-custodial and don’t need to individually verify tokens for compliance with regulations before listing them. This means you could find new projects on DEXs far before they are listed on a centralized exchange, offering traders opportunities for early access.

Decentralized exchanges can offer innovative trading features and incentive mechanisms not found in their centralized counterparts, such as yield farming, automated trading pools, and much more.

If you prioritize security, privacy, and control over your crypto, DEXs might be a good fit. They’re also useful for trading niche tokens unavailable on CEXs. There is, however, a learning curve to DEX trading, so make sure you’re well aware of the intricacies.

**Note: One thing to consider, though, is that you will need a self-custody wallet if you want to use a DEX. We have a comprehensive guide on the [top Solana wallets](https://cryptopotato.com/solana-wallets-guide/) that you can read and choose the one that best serves your needs.**

Let’s have a condensed look at their advantages and disadvantages because there are some.

Advantages of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
--------------------------------------------

DEXs have several pros and cons to them, and it’s important for users to look at both sides of the picture to make an informed decision.

### Ownership &amp; Enhanced Security

DEXs mitigate security risks associated with centralized exchanges by not having centralized systems privy to internal issues or external exploits. A centralized exchange holds users’ funds, making them vulnerable to certain risks, including:

*   Cybersecurity attacks
*   Custodial risks, censorship, and account banning
*   Your funds could be exposed or trapped in the platform.
*   Privacy is severely compromised since exchanges store and manage your personal information.

Instead, DEXs leverage smart contracts for trade execution and recording on the blockchain, ensuring trustless transactions. Moreover, you’re solely responsible for your coins since you manage your wallet.

### Privacy

DEXs offer increased privacy since users maintain control of their crypto wallets externally. This eliminates the need for traders to disclose private keys and relieves DEXs of liability for funds.

Furthermore, DEX users are not typically required to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, which can be convenient but may pose legal challenges in certain contexts.

In essence, DEXs provide the potential for heightened security through decentralization and offer greater privacy by not mandating users to disclose sensitive information such as emails, addresses, phone numbers, etc. However, this may raise regulatory concerns in certain countries with unclear crypto regulations.

### Accessibility

DEXs offer global accessibility, allowing users worldwide to access them as long as they have an internet connection and a compatible wallet. There are usually no jurisdiction-based restrictions.

### Asset Diversity

Likewise, DEXs boast a larger table of cryptocurrencies than their centralized counterparts. They are more open to smaller or lesser-known projects, enabling users to explore a broader range of assets.

Disadvantages of decentralized exchanges (DEX).
-----------------------------------------------

Let’s explore the cons of DEXs below, starting with smart contract security.

### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

While smart contracts create a trustless environment and eliminate third parties, they can be subject to code bugs or vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.

### Complexity

DEXs can be challenging for beginners to navigate, with less intuitive user interfaces and a requirement for greater technical knowledge to execute trades.

Fewer users also means there’s a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for any given token, making it harder to find a good match for your trade. While DEXs use AMMs, these ultimately can’t replicate the efficiency of matching specific buy and sell orders directly.

### Liquidity Issues

DEXs may suffer from lower liquidity, particularly for less popular tokens, potentially hindering trade execution at desired prices. Lower liquidity on DEXs can lead to higher slippage, meaning you might end up paying more (or receiving less) than you anticipated.

Comparison of the Top Solana DEXs
---------------------------------

The following is a summarized and comprehensive visual representation of their features and other characteristics.

[![Image 2: solana_dex_comparison (1)](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/solana_dex_comparison-1.jpg)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/solana_dex_comparison-1.jpg)

The 5 Best Solana DEXs
----------------------

With all of the above out of the way, let’s explore the best Solana DEXs.

The protocols were chosen based on trading volume, foundations, competitive features and fees, TVL, market capitalization, and other important components.

### Jupiter: Most Popular Solana DEX

Quick summary:

*   The most popular DEX on Solana. It’s behind one of the largest airdrops in crypto history: the JUP token.
*   Leading DEX by total value locked (TVL).
*   Leading DEX by derivatives volume.

[![Image 3: best_solana_dex_jupiter_image](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/best_solana_dex_jupiter_image.png)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/best_solana_dex_jupiter_image.png)

Jupiter is a decentralized exchange aggregator. That means it cross-checks and gathers prices across different DEXs to provide users with the best prices in the market. Its popularity is such that a lot of Solana DEX trades go through Jupiter, highlighting the protocol’s efficiency, low swap fees, and liquidity.

Jupiter started as a liquidity provider, similar to 1inch on Ethereum. However, the business model changed last year as the protocol decided to provide derivatives trading similar to GMX and dYdX.

JUP is the governance token that allows users to vote in favor or against all aspects and changes taking place on Jupiter. It’s also used as a discount fee for traders. The JUP token might be remembered for its massive airdrop, in which over 40% of the 10 billion minted tokens were allocated to the community and distributed periodically.

#### Key Features of Jupiter

[Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) is considered one of the best Solana DEXs, designed to facilitate token swaps with minimal slippage and affordable fees. Its user-friendly interface caters to both beginners and experienced traders, supporting over hundreds of tokens and thousands of trading pairs.

Here’s a quick rundown of Jupiter’s key features:

*   Limit Order: This feature enables users to place buy or sell orders at specific levels, aiding traders in avoiding slippage and securing optimal prices.
*   DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging): Permits users to purchase a fixed amount of tokens within a specified price range over a set period, offering flexibility in time intervals (minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months).
*   Bridge: Facilitates bridging tokens from EVM blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, or non-EVM blockchains like Tron to Solana, ensuring optimal routes for low slippage and transaction fees.
*   Perpetual: This feature allows users to trade futures contracts for supported tokens with a maximum leverage of up to x100. It is powered by Pyth Network, Solana’s biggest oracle network.

Moreover, the exchange also focuses on [developer tools](https://station.jup.ag/), making it easier to integrate DApps and interfaces. There are dozens of tools, documentation resources, and programs designed for developers, including:

*   Jupiter Terminal, which allows DEXs to integrate the Jupiter UI
*   A payments API, which allows users to pay for anything with any SPL token by using Jupiter and SolanaPay
*   An open-source referral program to provide referral fees for projects integrating Jupiter Swap and Jupiter Limit Order

#### What are the Jupiter Fees?

Jupiter does not charge transaction fees, but certain fees apply to other important features within the protocol. Here’s the breakdown:

*   Limit order fees: 0.2% on taker (partners integrating Jupiter Limit Order are entitled to a share of 0.1% referral fees. Jupiter collects the other 0.1% as platform fees, according to [Jupiter’s documentation page](https://station.jup.ag/guides/general/faq#:~:text=charge%20any%20fees%3F-,%E2%80%8B,program%20and%20are%20claimable%20anytime.)).
*   Jupiter DCA fee: 0.1% on order completion.

#### Which Wallets Does Jupiter Support?

Jupiter is compatible with most reputable wallets, including those from Solana and Ethereum. Some examples are:

*   OKX Wallet
*   Phantom
*   Ethereum Wallet
*   Solflare
*   Coinbase Wallet
*   Trust

### Raydium: Veteran Solana DEX

Quick summary:

*   Top Solana DEX by trading volume — $109B.
*   Largest DEX on Solana by TVL —$850M
*   RAY market capitalization: $410M

[![Image 4: top_solana_dex_raydium](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_raydium.png)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_raydium.png)

[Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/) (RAY) is a close contender to Jupiter in terms of trading volume. Both often surpass each other in terms of daily trading volume. It’s known for its slick, user-friendly design, low fees, and support for hundreds, if not thousands, of cryptocurrencies.

#### Main Features

Raydium facilitates token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming for users. The protocol facilitates asset trading using an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm. It also features Acceleraytor, a launchpad that hosts initial DEX offerings (IDOs) for new Solana projects.

What sets Raydium apart is its integration with OpenBook’s central limit order book. This allows users and liquidity pools on Raydium to tap into the broader liquidity and order flow of the entire OpenBook ecosystem and vice versa.

Raydium also allows anyone to create a liquidity pool for a token pair, allowing for permissionless participation and enhancing liquidity within the ecosystem.

#### What are Raydium Fees?

Raydium has a complex fee structure. It charges a small trading fee for each swap in a pool, which is typically 0.25% taken on the trade. The fee is then divided to reward liquidity providers, conduct RAY buybacks, and contribute to the Raydium treasury.

Treasury fees from CLMM pool trades are automatically converted to USDC and transferred to another designated address controlled by the Squads Multi-sig, which is used to cover RPC expenses.

For Concentrated Liquidity (CLMM) pools, the trading fee varies across four tiers: 100 bps, 25 bps, 5 bps, or 1 bp. Liquidity providers receive 84% of the fee, while 12% is allocated to RAY buybacks and the remaining 4% to the treasury.

Users who want to create a standard AMM pool must pay a fee of 0.4 SOL. This is done to discourage pool spamming and support the protocol’s sustainability.

#### What Wallets Does Raydium Support?

Raydium supports several wallets, including hardware wallets such as Ledger. Here’s a quick breakdown:

*   Solflare
*   Phantom
*   OKX Wallet
*   Trust Wallet
*   Sollet
*   Exodus

### Drift Protocol

Quick summary:

*   It has raised over $23 million, with lead investors including Multicoin Capital and Jump Capital.
*   Focus on both spot and derivatives DEX Trading
*   Cumulative volume of over $22B as of April 2024.

[![Image 5: top_solana_dex_drift](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_drift.jpg)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_drift.jpg)

[Drift Protocol](https://www.drift.trade/) is one of the largest Solana DEXs. It is designed as an open-source, non-custodial, and capital-efficient platform for those seeking spot and perpetuals trading.

It offers many features: spot and perpetuals trading, lending and borrowing, and passive liquidity provision. Naturally, most of the attention gravitates towards perpetuals. Users can long or short supported assets with up to 10x leverage.

#### Key Features of Drift Protocol

Drift Protocol uses a cross-margined risk engine, a keeper network, and multiple liquidity mechanisms, enabling the platform to provide users with low fees, minimal slippage, and high performance.

Moreover, it provides features such as automatic deposit yield and leveraged staking with annual yields of up to 10% (subject to fluctuations).

Drift v2 employs a series of complex trading and liquidity mechanisms to deliver a seamless experience for users. Some of its key components are:

*   Drift v2 AMM uses an external Backstop AMM Liquidity (BAL), which, in simple terms, allows users to provide backstop liquidity to specific markets, increasing the depth and collateralization within the market and earning them a rebate from taker fees.
*   Drift’s decentralized orderbook (DLOB): Limit orders are executed in two ways: they either match opposing orders at the same price or trigger against the Automated Market Maker (AMM) under specific conditions.
*   Keepers: They listen for, store, organize, and execute valid limit orders, compiling them into off-chain order books. Each Keeper maintains its own decentralized order book. They execute trades by matching crossing and limit orders against the AMM when certain conditions are met. They earn fees for executing trades.

#### What are Drift Protocol Fees?

Drift has a complex structure that uses the maker-taker fee model. Fees are calculated on a per-trade basis and the user’s position size. Review the [documentation page](https://docs.drift.trade/trading/trading-fees) for more information.

#### What Wallet Does Drift Protocol Support?

Drift Protocol supports multiple crypto wallets, including:

*   Phantom
*   Solflare
*   Trust Wallet
*   WalletConnect
*   Coin98.

### Orca

Quick summary:

The DEX stands out for its deep liquidity across multiple pools. This has been known to attract a lot of traders who are looking to optimize their overall DEX trading performance.

#### Key Features of Orca

Orca enables token swapping and provides a share of trading fees through its aquafarms. This concept of liquidity pooling for trading originated from Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.

Despite similarities with other Solana exchanges, Orca stands out due to several distinctive features.

*   Orca’s interface includes a Fair Price Indicator, aligning with its trader-centric design philosophy. This tool helps traders ensure that a cryptocurrency’s price remains within 1% of CoinGecko’s aggregated exchange prices, offering a comprehensive market overview within a single interface.
*   The protocol provides a convenient panel displaying user balances without requiring separate browser extensions.
*   Another key feature is the Magic Bar, a user-friendly search feature enabling quick access to desired token pairs by typing their tickers.

It should be evident by now that Orca’s approach is to simplify things for traders and liquidity providers, highlighting its user-centered approach.

An interesting feature of Orca is that every trade made on the network contributes to the [Orca Climate Fund](https://www.orcaclimate.fund/), an autonomous enterprise that invests in climate-friendly technologies and innovations.

#### What are Orca Fees?

Fees on the Orca DEX vary, depending on the percentage each pool charges independently.

Pools with a fee tier of ≥0.3%:

*   87% of the trading fee goes to the maker (Liquidity Provider)
*   12% is allocated to the DAO treasury.
*   1% is contributed to the Climate Fund.

Pools with a fee tier of &lt;0.3%:

*   All fees are paid to the maker (aka the liquidity provider).

Overall, this fee distribution model aims to incentivize liquidity provision while supporting the platform’s governance and contributing to environmental initiatives through the Climate Fund.

#### What Wallet Does Orca Support?

Orca supports multiple wallets, including hardware wallets like Ledger. Here’s a quick rundown:

*   Trust Wallet

[![Image 7: top_solana_dex_zeta](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_zeta.png)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/top_solana_dex_zeta.png)

[Zeta Markets](https://www.zeta.markets/) is a perpetuals exchange powered by the Solana blockchain. It was launched in 2021 and is backed by prominent venture capital (VC) investors, including Jump Capital, Wintermute, and Solana Ventures.

#### Key Features of Zeta Markets

Zeta Markets leverages the Solana blockchain to allow fast transactions and trade orders without compromising security. Here’s a rundown of the protocol’s main features:

*   Security: Users have full control over their assets with self-custody, and trading is margined in USDC, enhancing safety.

*   Institutional Liquidity: Zeta Markets facilitates programmatic connectivity through its SDK/CPI programs, enabling smart contract integration for Market Makers and other institutional players.
*   Gamification: The platform introduces gamified elements such as leaderboards, referral programs, and trading rewards, enhancing user engagement and interaction

#### What are Zeta Market Fees?

Zeta Markets uses fee tiers. You can view them on the [Fee Tiers documentation page](https://docs.zeta.markets/zeta-protocol/trading-specifications/fee-tiers). Note that fees are notably lower compared to other derivatives exchanges on Solana.

#### What Wallet Does Zeta Markets Support?

Compared to other DEXs, the wallet options are somewhat limited, as the protocol only supports Solflare, WalletConnect, Backpack, OKX Wallet, and Phantom.

#### Future Outlook for Solana DEXs

With the exception of Solana’s downturn in 2021 and 2022, largely induced by FTX’s downfall, the network and its token have performed very well, more or less, since their inception.

Recall that FTX was a strong backer of Solana, holding many SOL tokens. Once the exchange defaulted following SBF’s fiasco, many SOL investors reduced or eliminated their exposure out of fear for the entire network because of FTX’s influence.

However, the protocol itself has since proven resilient. Solana has successfully decoupled from the impact of FTX and proved that this wouldn’t have a long-term impact on it.

As a result, the network has been thriving, as it can be seen in multiple components, including but not limited to:

*   SOL’s price
*   Transaction count on Solana
*   New addresses on Solana
*   Development activity and more

A lot of it is owed to the success of the teams behind the best Solana decentralized exchanges because they underpin the entire local DeFi ecosystem.

If protocol developers continue to deliver and improve the capabilities of Solana, it’s perhaps justified to assume that the future for Solana DEXs is looking bright.

Is Trading on DEXs Safe?
------------------------

To answer this question, we must first make a few important clarifications.

First, trading on a DEX requires more technical knowledge and preparation, compared to trading on a centralized exchange. You have to have your own self-custody wallet, which can present certain challenges on its own.

However, if you are confident in your ability to maneuver in an on-chain environment, trading on a DEX can be safer. This is because you, as a trader, are in complete control over your funds—there is no central party that can censor your transactions, block your deposits or withdrawals, or impact your trading activities in any way.

All things considered, though, the majority of users are not as technical and might encounter challenges when trading on a DEX. That’s why it’s highly recommended to make sure that you are entirely aware of their intricacies so you don’t end up paying for high slippage or worse – put your coins in jeopardy.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Best Solana DEXs – Final Thoughts
---------------------------------

In conclusion, the Solana ecosystem boasts several prominent DEXs, each offering unique features and advantages.

The network continues to thrive in most measurable metrics, and DEX development has undoubtedly been a major part of it.

The teams compete to bring new and exciting features for traders, such as limit orders, on-chain derivatives trading, dynamic pools, and more—all of which are bound to attract traders as the ecosystem grows in the future.

Markdown Content:
In the realm of meme coins, [Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) (DOGE/USD) and Shiba Inu (SHIB/USD) have exhibited varied performance over the past month, yet analysts hold positive expectations for these tokens owing to imminent fundamental advancements.

Shiba Inu made headlines with its forthcoming Shibarium upgrade, slated for May 2, aimed at refining user experience and unlocking advanced functionalities within the network.

This enhancement seeks to streamline block processing times and ensure transaction fee predictability, thus rendering the platform more user-friendly and cost-effective.

Suggestions from community members, including trader Lola, advocate for integrating auto-burn features into this upgrade to bolster the token’s utility and appeal.

Concurrently, attention has been drawn to significant whale activity in the Dogecoin sphere, with two substantial transactions involving over 228 million DOGE each—totaling $68.7 million—transferred from an undisclosed wallet to Coinbase.

These wallet addresses, dormant since Coinbase’s initial Dogecoin listing in June 2021, indicate renewed activity, potentially hinting at forthcoming developments such as DOGE futures listing on Coinbase.

Institutional adoption of meme coins is gaining traction, as reflected in Shiba Inu’s inclusion in the Symbolic Capital Partners portfolio, representing 2% ($1.7 million) of their $86 million holdings, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

This trend suggests a burgeoning interest among institutional investors in meme coins, which could propel market valuation upward over time.

Cryptocurrency trader Kevin has analyzed Dogecoin’s historical performance, pinpointing potential price targets of 0.95 and 1.35 for the ongoing bull cycle.

However, he notes that reaching the current 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $3.80 may pose a challenge.

With transformative upgrades on the horizon for Shiba Inu and noteworthy whale activity indicating potential developments for Dogecoin, investors and traders maintain an optimistic outlook on the future trajectories of these meme coin frontrunners.

As of the latest update, DOGE was trading at $0.1489, marking a 21.4% decline over the past 30 days, while SHIB was trading at $0.00002523, reflecting an 18.4% decrease over the same period.

*   Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison despite DOJ’s request for a longer term.
*   Crypto market dips after Binance founder’s sentencing; BTC and ETH prices decline.
*   Kangamoon presale gains momentum raising over $6 million with over 79% $KANG tokens sold.

The global crypto market experienced a downturn, with a significant 8.17% decrease, following the sentencing of Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance. [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/) and [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/) prices are leading, with BTC dropping by 9.03% and ETH by 9.16% over the last 24 hours.

At press time, BTC was priced at $57,454.33, while ETH stood at $2,867.59. But as most cryptocurrencies dip, [Kangamoon](https://pr.kangamoon.com/1ditvb), a new meme coin, is offering an alternative opportunity with its ongoing presale.

Changpeng Zhao’s sentence after DOJ’s request rejection
-------------------------------------------------------

c, known as “CZ,” was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering violations at Binance.

As [reported earlier](https://coinjournal.net/news/changpeng-cz-zhao-faces-reduced-jail-time-as-judge-rejects-doj-request/), Zhao’s sentencing came after U.S. District Judge Richard Jones declined the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request for a longer imprisonment of three years.

Despite the significant penalties imposed on [Binanc](https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/)e, Zhao’s sentence was notably shorter, reflecting the judge’s decision.

The prosecution had argued for a longer sentence, emphasizing the severity of Binance’s misconduct. They accused Zhao of prioritizing the exchange’s growth and profitability over compliance with U.S. laws, leading to a “Wild West” environment that welcomed criminals. They also highlighted Binance’s failure to report suspicious transactions involving designated terrorist groups and its support for the sale of illicit materials.

In response, the defence maintained that Zhao’s actions were not intentional criminal acts but rather mistakes in judgment. They emphasized Zhao’s cooperation with authorities and his willingness to take responsibility for Binance’s shortcomings. They argued that Zhao had aimed to make a positive impact in the crypto industry but had made errors along the way.

In the end, the judge handed Zhao a 4 months prison sentence, which was viewed as lenient compared to what the U.S. DOJ wished for.

Despite the judge’s decision to impose a shorter sentence, he criticized Zhao for neglecting regulatory compliance. Judge Jones emphasized that Zhao had the resources and capabilities to ensure Binance’s adherence to regulations but had failed to do so effectively.

The judge’s remarks underscored the importance of upholding legal standards in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

A new meme coin thrives in presale as market dips
-------------------------------------------------

As the market reacts to the Changpeng Zhao sentencing, Kangamoon is contending for the next top meme coin position.

Contrary to other meme coins that have only capitalized on community involvement, Kangamoon integrates SocialFi and Play To Earn (P2E) elements to foster a vibrant community of meme enthusiasts.

Kangamoon participants can engage in activities like assembling champions, battling epic encounters, and betting on favourite fighters to earn the native $KANG tokens and exclusive rewards.

$KANG token is an ERC-20 token and operates on the Ethereum blockchain boasting a max supply of 1 billion tokens out of which 600 million tokens are available for purchase in the ongoing presale event.

Kangamoon presale
-----------------

The [Kangamoon presale](https://pr.kangamoon.com/1ditvb) has attracted considerable attention and has raised over $6 million, with 79.3% of tokens set aside for the presale sold and 20.7% remaining.

As participants eagerly anticipate claiming their $KANG tokens post-presale, which will be accessible via the project’s website through a simple claim button interested investors can still purchase $KANG tokens at a price of $0.0196 before the presale comes to an end.

Conclusion
----------

The crypto market faces a downturn following Changpeng Zhao’s sentencing, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices declining.

However, while the rest of the market slides into red, the Kangamoon project continues to gain momentum, with its $KANG token presale attracting significant investment interest.

Markdown Content:
The ongoing criminal case against CZ, the founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was concluded yesterday and CZ was sentenced to four months in prison.

While US prosecutors requested a 36-month prison sentence for CZ, the court did not accept this request and gave CZ a much lesser sentence.

CZ made his first statement after this sentence and thanked everyone who supported him during this process.

&gt; “I want to thank everyone for your care and support throughout this process, whether it's writing a letter, showing support at X, or any other way. They all mean so much to me and keep me strong.”

Referring to the project he started called Giggle Academy, CZ stated that he plans to devote most of his life to education.

“Funds SAFU!”
-------------

Finally, CZ stated that he will remain a passive investor (and owner) in the cryptocurrency industry and stated that the crypto industry has entered a new phase.

&gt; “I will remain a passive investor (and owner) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is key.
&gt; 
&gt; The positive side of this whole process is that Binance is under the spotlight. And the funds are SAFU.”

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).

As you may remember, Binance and its former CEO CZ pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering and violating US sanctions charges within the scope of the agreement with the US government.

While signing one of the largest corporate agreements in US history, Binance paid 4.3 billion dollars within the scope of this agreement; As part of the agreement, CZ resigned from his position as Binance CEO and agreed to pay a fine of $50 million.

*   **U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs finished Tuesday with another outflow.**
*   **The performance comes after the funds bled $51.6 million on Monday.**
*   **At the same time, the latest outflows coincided with BTC’s plunge.**

U.S-listed [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-spot-bitcoin-etf-why-is-it-important/) (ETFs) witnessed tens of millions in net outflows on Tuesday amid market turbulence that put BTC on track for its worst month since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange FTX in November 2022.

The bear market-like performance comes after what observers termed a poor debut of Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on April 30. Despite anticipating a combined first-day [inflow of $300 million](https://dailycoin.com/hong-kong-crypto-etf-issuers-foresee-300m-first-day-inflows/), the Hong Kong ETFs seemingly fell out of favor, recording $11.2 million in trading volume.

According to preliminary [data](https://farside.co.uk/?p=997) shared by Farside Investors, the Nasdaq-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw 161.6 million in net outflows on Tuesday, marking the fourth consecutive day of outflows for the funds in the past week.

Grayscale’s GBTC fund was the biggest culprit of the day, hemorrhaging $93.2 million as Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and Invesco’s BTCO recorded net outflows of $35.3 million, $34.3 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.  

Notably, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB was the only fund that posted an inflow, attracting $3.6 million from investors on Tuesday. The rest of the funds, including Blackrock’s IBIT, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, VanEck’s HODL, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded $0 inflows on April 30.

As for Bitcoin, the crypto asset’s price fell to a $59,100 low in the afternoon hours of Tuesday, its weakest price since late February. BTC has lost over 9% in the last 24 hours and about 17% throughout April to trade at $57,5203 as of press time, CoinMarketCap [data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) shows.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-plummets-under-57000-as-crypto-market-faces-bear-market-reality/

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) continued its downward trend for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, marking its poorest monthly performance since late 2022. 

This decline comes as investors withdraw funds from [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) in anticipation of an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

In April alone, [Bitcoin](https://finbold.com/guide/fastest-way-to-buy-bitcoin/) plummeted nearly 16% as investors cashed in on a robust rally that had earlier driven prices to over $73,000. Most recently, Bitcoin dropped to below $57,000, reaching its lowest level since late February.

Currently, Bitcoin’s price is 22% below its March peak of $73,803, placing it firmly in [bear market](https://finbold.com/guide/bear-market-definition/) territory. Despite this, Bitcoin has still gained 28% this year and is double its value from last year, largely fueled by substantial investments in new exchange-traded funds ([ETFs](https://finbold.com/guide/exchange-traded-funds-etfs/)) since January. 

Crypto experts give Bitcoin insights
------------------------------------

Analysts are offering varying perspectives on Bitcoin’s current market position. Mags, known as _thescalpingpro_, suggests that $57,000 area might be a critical low point for Bitcoin. According to Mags, the best scenario for bullish investors would be if Bitcoin briefly dips to $57,500 below a key resistance area, only to quickly recover before the week closes—a pattern he refers to as a potential “fakeout.”

On the other hand, Michaël van de Poppe believes that Bitcoin’s price correction is nearing its end, though he anticipates some additional declines. Poppe notes that Bitcoin has already fallen 20% from recent highs and expects further downward movement.

_Plan B_ provides a broader historical perspective, pointing out that Bitcoin’s closing price in April was $60,632, marking the last “blue dot” month of the current cycle. He highlights the average price of $34,000 during the 2020-2024 halving cycle, which is just below the $55,000 forecast made by the stock-to-flow (S2F) model in 2019.

Looking forward, Plan B anticipates that May will introduce the “first red dot,” signaling the commencement of a countdown to the next halving cycle, with the S2F model predicting a substantial rise to approximately $500,000 by 2024-2028.

Bitcoin downturn
----------------

This recent downturn is largely due to increased profit-taking by investors who joined during the downturns in 2022 and 2023, and those in ETFs who have seen significant gains since early 2024.

On the broader economic front, although the Federal Reserve is not expected to adjust interest rates imminently, there is growing belief among investors that there might be no rate cuts throughout the year, negatively affecting interest-sensitive assets like cryptocurrencies, emerging market equities, and bonds, as well as commodities. 

This sentiment is reflected in the record outflows seen this week from the ten largest U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $496 million, with a noticeable slowdown in inflows to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, according to LSEG data.

Despite the Bitcoin halving event last month, which typically bolsters BTC by reducing the rate of new coin creation, the price has fallen by about 15% since April 20. This decline follows a buying spree by investors ahead of the event, underscoring the high volatility and speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Chirp Network has partnered with peaq to provide connectivity solutions for [decentralized](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-decentralized-exchanges/) physical infrastructure networks (DePINs).

According to a press release shared with Cryptonews.com, Chirp Network will integrate its telecommunications technology with peaq, the layer-1 blockchain for DePIN and machine [real-world assets](https://cryptonews.com/news/rwa-tokenization-protocols-surpass-8-billion-in-tvl.htm) (RWAs).

Chirp and peaq Collaborate to Enhance Device Communication
----------------------------------------------------------


Chirp is developing a unified, multi-protocol decentralized connectivity network capable of facilitating data exchange across any supported protocol and any distance.

Its network features “Blackbird” gateway devices, already operational in 33 countries, which would provide connectivity across various [IoT](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-depin/) channels such as LoRaWAN, LoRa 2.4 GHz, and BLE.

The Blackbird devices are powered by Chirp’s LTE networks, enabling them to connect devices across the globe. This aims to enable seamless data exchange across networks and fleets, supporting a borderless communication backbone.

By partnering with peaq, Chirp aims to offer versatile connectivity for DePINs, connecting smart devices worldwide using major IoT protocols.

[![Image 5: a man is holding a coin in front of a red background](https://cimg.co/other/906/337275/99bitcoin-tokens-960x200.png)](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/outgoing/906/1/5)

“Decentralized connectivity and networking is an important function for any DePIN,” stated peaq co-founder Till Wendler.

“peaq’s integration with Chirp unlocks this crucial feature for all DePINs in the ecosystem, enabling devices all over the world to communicate via a people-owned network,” said Wendler.

Supporting DePIN Projects with Connectivity Features
----------------------------------------------------


[XMAQUINA](https://www.peaq.network/blog/xmaquina-unveils-the-worlds-first-tokenized-robo-cafe-on-peaq), the creator of the first fully autonomous tokenized robot cafe, will use Chirp Network for connectivity in the peaq ecosystem. The project’s robotic barista was recently presented at the TOKEN2049 conference in Dubai.

The barista operated autonomously by connecting to the peaq blockchain through Chirp’s IoT connectivity layer, enabling data exchange.

“Our integration with peaq will bring the DePINs building in its ecosystem one major step closer to it — ultimately resulting in a world whose infrastructure backbone is run by its users,” said Chirp Network founder Tim Kravchunovsky.

Chirp also planned to provide connectivity for ELOOP, which enables tokenized investments in DePINs via the peaq network, and for Silencio, a DePIN that rewards users with crypto for collecting noise pollution data.

Pike Finance has been exploited, resulting in the loss of $1.68 million worth of digital assets. The incident marks the protocol’s second exploit in three days.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Pike Finance suffered a $1.68 million exploit across the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism chains on April 30, according to a report from on-chain analytics firm CertiK, shared with Cointelegraph.

The attacker used a vulnerability in Pike Finance’s smart contract to change the output address, draining the contract of over $1.4 million worth of Ether ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)), $150,000 worth of Optimism (OP) tokens and over $100,000 worth of Arbitrum (ARB) tokens, according to CertiK.

Pike also suffered a $300,000 exploit on April 26.

The two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract, [according](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to a May 1 X post by Pike Finance:

&gt; “This misalignment caused the contract to behave as if it was uninitialized since the \*initialized\* variable could no longer be accessed. As a result, attackers were then able to upgrade the spoke contracts, bypassing admin access, and as a result, withdraw funds.”

Pike Finance is offering a 20% reward for the return of the funds or information leading to the recovery of the funds. The protocol will continue investigating the exploit.

Crypto hacks fell to a three-year low in April
----------------------------------------------

Only [$25.7 million was lost](https://cointelegraph.com/news/april-25m-exploits-scams-historical-low-certik) to cryptocurrency hacks and scams during the month of April, which is the lowest monthly amount since 2021, according to an April 30 report from CertiK seen by Cointelegraph.

Total losses from exploits and scams fell 141% from the previous month, mainly attributed to a lack of private key compromises. In March, there were 11 attacks against protocols via private key compromises, whereas in April, there were only three.

![Image 3: a bar graph showing the number of people who have been hacked by certiq](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/2a9859cc-788d-4d6d-9778-e02c78f7e217.png)

_Hacks by type. Source:_ _CertiK_

Despite the record-low month, crypto attacks remain a significant industry issue. Over $502 million worth of digital assets were stolen across 223 hacks and exploits during the first quarter of 2024, [according](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/hack3d-the-web3-security-quarterly-report-q1-2024) to a CertiK report.

This represents a 54% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023, which saw a total of $326 million worth of funds stolen.

Boda bodas are synonymous with life in East Africa, and in bustling cities like Nairobi, Kampala and Dar es Salaam, these motorbike taxis are the best way to weave your way to your destination.

For millions of Africans, boda bodas are a primary mode of transport and a vital means of income. The sector is about to experience a wave of fresh innovation, with blockchain technology set to provide real-time tracking of vehicles financed by asset financing company Watu.

![Image 2: a group of people riding motorcycles on a busy street](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/2e2fd651-8634-4a65-b40c-a57e34279cf0.jpg)

In an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Watu outlined a new partnership with Nodle’s blockchain-powered decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) to enhance vehicle tracking of motorbikes it has financed.

**_Related:_** [**_IoT project turns smartphones into blockchain nodes to broaden connectivity_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/iot-project-turns-smartphones-into-blockchain-nodes-to-broaden-connectivity)

Watu has provided loans to over one million Africans in seven countries, allowing individuals to access finance to purchase motorcycles and offer taxi services.

Noodle’s DePIN infrastructure will power real-time location data for the vehicles, aimed at protecting owners in case of theft and helping Watu have better visibility of the assets it has financed.

The project will start in Uganda in May 2024 and expand to Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of theCongo over the next few months.

The Watu asset location solution will be built on the Nodle Network, a decentralized mobile network where users’ smartphones act as nodes in a secure DePIN.

Nodle’s DePIN operates on smartphones and is touted to provide wide coverage and precise tracking due to the ubiquity of smartphones and advanced geolocation capabilities.

Nodle co-founder and CEO Micha Benoliel said the partnership with Watu will significantly boost the deployment of the network in Africa. He added that smartphones will account for 88% of mobile connections by 2030, up from the present rate of 50%.

Watu head of GPS tracking Gunars Bidins said that Nodle’s network is ideally suited for Watu’s asset management needs:

&gt; “This collaboration allows us to track our asset fleet more efficiently and cost-effectively, ensuring the safety and security of our assets across our expanding African operations.”

Nodle’s chief product officer, Florent Stroppa, believes the use case explored with Watu demonstrates DePIN’s benefits to economies and society. He said that the crowdsourced network will allow new services to be deployed quickly and cost-effectively:

&gt; “In this particular instance, the technology is used to track assets that are usually difficult to locate. We are really excited to work with Watu in this deployment.”

DePINs are a fast-growing sector of the blockchain industry. The technology is being used to source cloud computing resources through [projects like io.net](http://io.net/) and a host of other real-world use cases recently explored in the [latest podcast episode](https://cointelegraph.com/news/onboarding-billions-users-invisible-blockchain-rise-de-pins) of _Decentralize with Cointelegraph_.

![Image 4: Cosmos Hub Price Prediction as ATOM Stays Green Despite Market Crash – Should You Invest Today?](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01093226/1714555946-cosmos-hub-price-prediction-as-atom-stays-green-despite-market-crash-should-you-invest-today.jpg)

The [Cosmos Hub price](https://cryptonews.com/coins/cosmos/) has risen by 4% today, moving ATOM to $8.30 as the cryptocurrency market loses a big 9% in 24 hours.

Despite this lift, ATOM remains down by 5% in a week and by 30% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also sitting on a 26% decline in the past year.

While its performance has disappointed in recent months, it almost seems that traders have turned to its already-discounted price today at a time of market-wide stress.

It could therefore be on the cusp of a big rally, particular as the market as a whole begins to recover.

Cosmos Hub Price Prediction as ATOM Stays Green Despite Market Crash – Should You Invest Today?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The most noticeable feature of ATOM’s chart is that, after having risen overall in the past day, the coin has actually fallen steeply in the past hour or so, as holders react to the market-wide crash.

Accordingly, its relative strength index (purple) has dropped from 70 earlier this morning to just under 50 now, signalling a big loss of momentum.

Source: TradingView

It’s possible that the RSI will fall towards and below 30 before we see a turnaround, with ATOM’s 30-day average (orange) also flattening out in the past hour after rising strongly in the morning.

One of the more bearish signals in ATOM’s chart comes from the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are both sliding down.

This suggests that the coin will sink to a new medium-term level before right itself, with its spike in volume signalling an increasing desire to sell out of the token.

&gt; Are we going to catch a bounce on [$ATOM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ATOM&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)?

Some analysts predicted ATOM’s bounce this morning, although it’s worth considering that, within the context of the cryptocurrency market, predictions by prominent analysts sometimes become self-fulfilling prophecies.

Still, the market has oversold ATOM for so long that the coin is more than deserving of a sustained comeback.

This is particularly the case when looking at the coin’s fundamentals, with Cosmos regularly growing as an interchain for crypto’s various platforms and networks.

And as the wider ecosystem continues to expand in the coming months and years, Cosmos is only likely to attract more use.

This points to a rising Cosmos Hub price over time, with ATOM likely to reach $10 in the next few weeks, before touching $15 by the final months of the year.

It will have to wait for [pessimism surrounding recent economic data](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-drift-lower-focus-shifts-rate-verdict-2024-04-30/) to ebb away, but once it does, it should come racing back.

Diversify with High-Potential Presale Tokens
--------------------------------------------


Because ATOM is likely to follow the rhythms of the market as a whole, many traders may prefer to look to more volatile tokens for their gains in the near term.

This includes diversifying into [new meme coins](https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coins/), and in particular new tokens that are holding their presales and gaining momentum as they prepare to list.

One such coin gaining plenty of momentum right now is [Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE)](https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised more than $12 million in its ongoing presale.

Billing itself as the first ever Doge-themed multichain cryptocurrency, DOGEVERSE will run on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.

This already sets it apart from most other new meme coins, with its usability of multiple chains meaning that it may attract greater adoption and use.

And when combined with a max supply of 120 million tokens, rising demand is likely to make DOGEVERSE a deflationary cryptocurrency.

Any deflationary tendencies will also be heightened by the ability to stake the token, which will take a substantial proportion of the coin’s supply out of circulation.

Given such features, it’s no wonder that Dogeverse has been able to hold one of the most successful presales of the year.

The sale will end in several weeks, but latecomers can still join at [the official Dogeverse website](https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogeverse/), where 1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000304.

Such a price is likely to seem very low once the token lists in the next couple of months.

In the hours leading up to the next Federal Reserve meeting, investor pessimism has hit [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) and [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) hard.

At the time of writing, BTC has dropped 7.6% and ETH is down 6% over the past 24 hours. The [Bitcoin price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) is hovering around $57,000, while the [Ethereum price](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) is stuck at just under $2,900, according to data from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/).

The volatility has been hellish for derivatives traders. In the past 24 hours, $457 million worth of crypto futures positions have been liquidated, according to [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData). And no big surprise, $392 million of those were long contracts.

Traders opening futures contracts are essentially placing bets on future price action. To be long on an asset is to bet the price will go up. And to be short on it is to bet it'll go down.

And it's not just blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have been impacted. Sagging prices have been [widespread](https://decrypt.co/228820/crypto-market-cap-down-4-percent-top-100-red?amp=1) throughout the market. In fact, out of the whole top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinGecko, just a few assets have escaped the sea of red, barring stablecoins that have managed to maintain their pegs, such as Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC.

The U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee will publish its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.. Back in February, investors seemed certain that May would be the month that the FOMC finally cut interest rates—which is usually a bullish sign for risk assets like Bitcoin.

[Crypto Market Sinks Amid Global Economic Uncertainty](https://decrypt.co/228820/crypto-market-cap-down-4-percent-top-100-red)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto is having a dismal day, fighting a withering stretch of headwinds. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies stands at $2.33 trillion, down 4.81% in the past day, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, April is now the first month since January in which the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has returned to neutral territory, canceling the overall greedy mood of 2024. Tuesday trends are overwhelmingly bearish, with every coin in the top 100 showing negative performance over the past 24 hours. Unus Se...

That's because lowered interest rates usually coax traders out of U.S. Treasuries to chase gains in riskier assets, like equities and crypto assets.

The Fed's key interest rate currently stands at a high of 5.25% to 5.5% and has been unchanged since [July 2023](https://decrypt.co/148273/bitcoin-trades-flat-as-june-cpi-clocks-3) as the central bank aims to curb inflation. Policymakers have been keeping a close eye on inflation, which is [currently 3.5%](https://decrypt.co/225622/bitcoin-ethereum-dive-us-inflation-data), in hopes to get it closer to 2% before considering rate reductions. But that's becoming a distant hope, as last month inflation increased to the highest it's been since September.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin and Ethereum sank lower, each dropping more than 2% immediately after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in March. That means inflation last month was virtually unchanged from February and is still at 3.5%, according to the new BLS data. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has slipped to below $68,000 and the Ethereum price is threatening to go lower than $3,400. Both assets—easily the two largest cryptocurrencies—account for...

Traders had a small jolt of hope in March, when the Swiss Central Bank announced it was [cutting interest rates](https://decrypt.co/222765/bullish-bitcoin-swiss-central-bank-first-cut-interest-rates). “For some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability,” the central bank wrote in its [decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/switzerland-becomes-first-major-economy-to-cut-interest-rates-in-surprise-move.html) at the time. But it seems the sentiment in Switzerland hasn't spread to other major central banks.

Just a month ago, traders seemed certain that the Fed might lower interest rates in June, according to the CME Fed Watch tool. But sentiment has soured. Traders don't expect to see the Fed ease interest rates until December—and even then it's just a 75% majority that seem to feel that way.

*   **The Federal Reserve is expected to keep the interest rate unchanged after the FOMC meeting.**
*   **JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs believe the Fed will reduce interest rates in July.**
*   **While Wells Fargo hopes that the Fed will cut rates in September,** **Bank of America posits that no reduction will happen until December.**

The Federal Reserve is [expected to hold](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-to-signal-delay-of-interest-rate-cuts-1.2067271) the interest rate unchanged at the two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.5% after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. While the two-day meeting began on Tuesday, market observers divided over the views on the Fed’s decision on Wednesday.

Chinese crypto journalist Coil Wu shared an X post on Wu Blockchain, shedding light on the diverse forecasts from major industry players. Notably, financial giants JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expect the Fed’s first interest rate reduction this year in July. At the same time, the financial services company Wells Fargo believes that the Fed will cut rates in September.

&gt; CNN: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expect the first cut in July, while Wells Fargo is betting on September. Bank of America doesn’t expect the first cut until December. Some Fed policymakers, meanwhile, have even floated the possibility of a rate hike, instead of a cut.…

Reportedly, there is approximately a 44% chance for the Fed to cut interest rates in September. However, Bank of America strongly believes the Fed will not cut the rate until December. Meanwhile, some Fed policymakers hint at a possible interest hike rather than a cut.

In an April 16 meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a longer period of high-interest rates and the central bank’s preference to keep policy restrictive “as long as needed.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg economists cited,

&gt; “We expect Powell to make a hawkish pivot at the April 30-May 1 meeting. At the minimum, he’ll likely indicate the median FOMC participant now expects ‘less’ cuts this year. In a more hawkish direction, he could hint at a chance of no cuts — or even suggest a hike might be on the table, though not the current baseline.”

Until it is clear that the inflation is closing in on 2%, the Fed will not lower the rates. Michael Gapen, Head of US Economics at Bank of America Corp, stated, “The message will be wait-and-see and policy needs more time to work.”

The arrest of early Bitcoin investor and Bitcoin cash proponent Roger Ver on tax evasion charges in the United States has invoked strong reactions from the crypto community. 

Many within the community criticized the arrest, with some [justifying](https://x.com/koinosthegoat/status/1785442263663026667) it over Ver’s adoption of an anti-Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) stance in the latter part of his career.

Dan Held, a long-term Bitcoin proponent, was among the few who lauded Ver’s arrest, saying, “he’s been a net negative for Bitcoin.”

Crypto-centered X account Pledditor [suspected](https://x.com/Pledditor/status/1785574858572681319) that Ver’s arrest is related to his name popping up in several investigations, such as those involving Binance, Genesis and Three Arrows Capital.

Numerous cryptocurrency veterans denounced the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for pursuing tax evasion charges against Ver in the U.S. despite his renouncing his citizenship in 2014.

Ver — who has been a Japanese citizen since 2014 — was arrested in Spain on April 30 based on criminal charges in the U.S., which include mail fraud, tax evasion and filing false tax returns.

The DOJ notice [alleges Ver evaded taxes worth $48 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/roger-ver-tax-fraud-charges) on his Bitcoin and crypto sales in 2017. Ver now faces extradition to the United States.

Ver’s arrest prompted several crypto veterans to call out U.S. law enforcement agencies for their misuse of power. Social media crypto users quickly pointed out that Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, and the tax evasion charges were for selling assets in 2017.

Paul Sztorc, founder and CEO of LayerTwo Labs, tweeted that Ver did everything according to law when he first legally left the U.S. for Japan.

Sztorc said Ver paid his taxes in Japan, also paid his taxes in the U.S., and, despite nine years of legally paying his taxes, was arrested in Spain a decade later. He noted the situation is “not exactly government via the consent of the governed.”

Kim Dotcom, a crypto veteran who has also been on the receiving end of government enforcement, [said](https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1785515855893450813) that the indictment against Ver has nothing to do with tax evasion but rather a “witch hunt against a man who turned his back on U.S. wars and malicious foreign and domestic policy.” He added: “Roger is a supporter of Julian Assange and press freedom not just with words but with actions.”

Jane Adams, a 2024 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and a Bitcoin proponent, [said](https://x.com/iLoveJaneAdams/status/1785526974213136513) that Ver’s arrest is a blatant attack on dissent. She added that the U.S. government’s pursuit against Ver is fueled by vindictiveness, as he advocates for press freedom and is against U.S. "imperialism.”

A few others speculated Ver’s arrest to be a part of larger crypto targeting by the U.S. government. DavidShares, a Bitcoin proponent on X, said the U.S. is aggressively coming after crypto.

In another post, he stated that the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to push through a lot of anti-cryptocurrency enforcement and regulations before upcoming presidential elections in November.

The world of cryptocurrencies is abuzz with the potential arrival of a new Exchange Traded Fund (ETF): the Litecoin ETF. Championed by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, the proposed ETF is aiming to gain the coveted approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Lee, brimming with optimism, recently spoke about the prospects of a Litecoin ETF. His confidence stems from the structural similarities between Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC).

[![Image 2: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714560341667344&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Flitecoin-proposed-etf-could-boost-cryptos-appeal%2F&amp;hc=784c6f16fe8eb267f15fe3b4f353fbc1330b652a&amp;location=)

Both currencies utilize the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a factor that Lee believes positions Litecoin favorably for an ETF classification. Additionally, Lee argues that the altcoin’s status as a commodity strengthens its case for ETF eligibility.

**Early Days, Long-Term Game: Navigating Demand For A Litecoin ETF**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While Lee acknowledges that initial demand for an ETF might not rival the fervor surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF, he remains bullish on its long-term prospects. He sees the burgeoning crypto industry as fertile ground for Litecoin to showcase its value proposition and growth potential to investors as the market matures.

**The Ethereum Shadow: PoS And Regulatory Hurdles**
---------------------------------------------------

There’s a contrast between Litecoin and Ethereum (ETH) when discussing [potential ETF approvals](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-sec-expected-deny-spot-ether-etfs-next-month-industry-sources-say-2024-04-25/). Ethereum’s reliance on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism throws a wrench into the works.

The SEC has controversially categorized PoS cryptos as securities, a classification that has stalled applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. This regulatory grey area has resulted in months of delays and postponements for such proposals, leading some to believe outright denial is a possibility.

### **Lee Doubles Down On Litecoin, Expresses Reservations On Ethereum ETF**

Beyond his hopes for a Litecoin ETF, Lee offered his thoughts on the prospects of an Ethereum ETF. While acknowledging the potential for high demand due to Ethereum’s broader ecosystem and utility, Lee expressed significant reservations about its approval due to the aforementioned regulatory hurdles.

### **Analyst View: A Hopeful, But Cautious Outlook**

Market analysts, while intrigued by the possibility of a Litecoin ETF, urge a dose of caution. The SEC’s past handling of crypto ETF applications, particularly the delays plaguing Ethereum ETFs, serves as a reminder of the regulatory roadblocks that lie ahead.

Additionally, even if approved, an LTC ETF might take a considerable amount of time to gain mainstream traction among investors.

### **SEC Approval And Market Response Remain Pivotal**

The possibility of a Litecoin ETF paints a hopeful picture for the future of LTC. However, the path to approval is far from certain. The SEC’s ultimate decision and the market’s response to a potential ETF will be crucial factors to watch. Whether Litecoin basks in the spotlight of a successful ETF launch or remains on the periphery will depend on navigating these critical hurdles.

BlackRock’s BUIDL Outshines Templeton’s Tokenized Treasury Fund
---------------------------------------------------------------

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and has recently introduced its first tokenized fund, BUIDL. It relies on Ethereum Blockchain to offer US Dollars for the investors to earn through the investment. It has become the world's largest tokenized treasury fund. It outperforms Franklin Templeton’s 1 year tokenized fund in less than 6 weeks.  

### What’s the news

The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund now becomes the world’s largest treasury fund which is tokenized on [Ethereum](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/secs-chief-tags-eth-as-unregistered-security"Ethereum")  Blockchain, outshadows Franklin Templeton’s tokenized fund. This six-week-old product has a market capitalization of $375 million, it suppresses the 1-year-old blockchain with 6 weeks (this week). Franklin Templeton’s on-chain US Government Money Fund (BENJI) which has a market capitalization of $368 million. 

The statistics show that BUIDL took $70 million last week which includes $50 million from Ondo Finance’s OUSG token, a real-world tokenization asset. Around this time Franklin Templeton’s BENJI in AUM shrunk by 3.7%. BUIDL successively grew by 36.5% from $274 million to $375 million. However, BENJI grew by 2.1% from $360 million to $368 million. 

CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink has recently revealed that capital markets could work more efficiently and effectively if move on chains. The US treasury has worth $1.2 billion in blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, [Solana](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-blogs-details/solana-and-furrever-token-crypto-landscape-update-2024"Solana"), and many others. Besides treasury, stock, real estate, and many other assets can also be tokenized.  

A research strategist Tom Wan has communicated some facts and reasons behind the low demand for these tokenized products by investors. The primary reason is thin liquidity. Another reason is uncleared benefits in the token assets due to low demand. However, the US treasury has a $140 billion stablecoin market from industry players. Hence, it will be easy to find end users. Wan also stated that tokenized assets on blockchains are 1.4% and it may reach 10% soon, as predicted. The Boston Consulting Group evaluated tokenization to be $16 trillion on the blockchain in 2030. 

#### BlackRock’s BUIDL

BUIDL stands for BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. It is a new evolving tokenized fund launched by BlackRock. It performs operations on Ethereum Blockchain which opens the door of earning for investors to yield US Dollars from new tokenized funds. 

BUIDL provides liquidity, instant transaction, and settlement, and also maintains stability in token value. BUIDL is generally safe to invest as it trades with US treasury bills and distributes monthly tokens as dividends. It wisely manages the financial markets of tokenization.

#### Conclusion

According to the Coin Gabbar, the summary of the above says that BlackRock’s BUIDL is an innovative approach reaching a market cap of $375 million. It can be seen as blockchain as a tool for efficient capital markets. Despite low demand for tokenized products, the US treasury's presence on blockchains and a growing stablecoin market offer promise. BUIDL ensures liquidity, instant transactions, and stability through US treasury bill trading making it the world’s largest treasury fund.

VALR, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Africa, is set to offer its crypto asset services in Poland and is actively exploring opportunities in other jurisdictions worldwide. 

The exchange aims to challenge some of the global crypto giants, CEO Farzam Ehsani [said in an interview with Reuters.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/south-african-cryptocurrency-exchange-valr-targets-global-expansion-2024-04-30/)

VALR is among the 75 crypto asset service providers that recently received licenses from the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in South Africa. 

VALR Boasts 600,000 Retail Customers
------------------------------------


Established in 2018, VALR provides a range of services to its extensive customer base, including spot trading, margin trading, perpetual futures, and staking products. 

With over 600,000 retail customers and more than 1,000 institutional customers globally, the exchange serves a predominantly South African clientele, while 25% of its user base hails from various parts of the world.

VALR has recently obtained approval to offer crypto asset services in Poland, and it has also received initial approval from Dubai’s regulator, VARA. 

Additionally, the exchange is in the process of obtaining a license in Mauritius. 

“The intention here is to be able to provide products and services to a global audience that is continuously growing,” Ehsani said. 

&gt; “The intention is to actually become a global player because we’re not satisfied with being the largest in Africa (by trading volume).”

While expanding its reach, VALR is actively seeking regulatory clarity in other jurisdictions, including African countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Egypt, the CEO said. 

However, the Nigerian market has faced hurdles as authorities imposed restrictions on crypto exchanges earlier this year. 

Ehsani stated that until there is clarity in Nigeria’s regulatory environment, VALR will not venture into the country.

VALR Aims to Compete With Global Exchanges like Binance
-------------------------------------------------------


To compete with major global crypto exchanges like [Binance](https://cryptonews.com/reviews/binance/), VALR plans to offer similar products and services, with future considerations for additional offerings such as insurance. 

The exchange’s South African license allows it to provide general crypto asset trading and services. 

For specialized products like perpetual futures trading, VALR collaborates with other financial service providers who hold the necessary licenses, acting as a “juristic representative.”

The recent establishment of a licensing regime for cryptocurrencies by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) positions South Africa as one of the pioneering African nations in this area. 

As part of this regime, the FSCA is [preparing to issue 60 licenses](https://cryptonews.com/news/south-african-regulator-grants-approval-to-59-crypto-platforms-for-resident-services.htm) to crypto firms in the coming weeks, with Luno, Zignaly, and VALR already being granted licenses. 

As reported, several members of the crypto community have said that South Africa’s approaching [elections are unlikely to disrupt the country’s progress](https://cryptonews.com/news/can-the-upcoming-south-africa-elections-swing-in-favor-of-crypto.htm) in the realm of digital assets.

South Africa expanded the scope of its Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act in 2022 to encompass crypto providers, enabling the regulation of digital assets as financial products.

**On early Wednesday morning, blockchain [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) firm Cyvers identified several anomalous transactions on the cross-chain lending protocol of Pike Finance. Cyvers further revealed that this suspicious transaction resulted in a substantial financial loss of approximately $1.6 million.**

The illicit activity was primarily conducted across Ethereum (ETH), [Arbitrum](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-arbitrum/) (ARB), and Optimism (OP) blockchains. The intruder leveraged a privacy-focused tool, Railgun, on Arbitrum for their cyberattack.

Pike Finance Suffered Exploitations Twice in Three Days
-------------------------------------------------------

On-chain surveillance platform CertiK quickly traced the attack’s origins to April 30. It reveals that the attacker used a method to insert a malicious code by invoking the initialize function, which manipulated Pike Finance’s smart contract system.

&gt; “\[The\] attacker was able to initialize Pike Finance’s contract, during which the \_isActive variable is set to the attacker’s address. The attacker could then use this privilege to call the contracts upgradeToAndCall function and change the implementation to one that they had created. They were then able to drain the contract’s assets,” CertiK’s representative told BeInCrypto. **Read more: [Top 5 Flaws in Crypto Security and How To Avoid Them](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-security/)**

According to the detailed breakdown provided by Pike Finance, the attacker upgraded the spoke contracts under a previously compromised framework. They then exploited the smart contract’s misaligned storage mapping.

&gt; “As a result, attackers were then able to upgrade the spoke contracts, bypassing admin access, and withdraw funds,” the Pike Finance team [wrote](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644).

Pike Finance also highlighted its commitment to investigating the breach further. Additionally, it offers a 20% reward for any information leading to recovering the stolen assets. It will also discuss and announce plans to compensate affected users.

The recent exploit has a connection to a vulnerability in its USD Coin (USDC) withdrawal on April 26. Pike Finance acknowledged that the vulnerability is “due to weak security measures in functions managing USDC transfers via CCTP protocol. A critical flaw was found in the functions meant for burning USDC on a source chain and minting on a target chain, which was automated by Gelato’s services.

The exploitation saw the loss of 299,127 USDC, affecting three networks — Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. However, Pike Finance claimed that the incident only affected USDC assets, and all other assets are safe.

*   **Binance CZ stresses compliance’s significance in crypto amid a four-month sentence.**
*   **He expressed gratitude for community support, vowing to focus on education post-prison.**
*   **Prominent figures laud CZ’s contributions to crypto innovation and entrepreneurship.**

Former CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has asserted that “compliance is super important” for the crypto industry after being sentenced to four months imprisonment. In his latest statement on X after his sentencing, Zhao expressed heartfelt gratitude to the crypto community for their care and support during his trying times.

He noted that those efforts have been pivotal in keeping him strong while he battled the U.S. authorities. “I will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life,” CZ remarked. 

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).

&gt; I will remain a…
&gt; 
&gt; — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Notably, on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones sentenced the Binance founder to four months in prison. This sentencing comes after CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money-laundering laws with the Binance exchange.

Last November, Zhao admitted guilt to neglecting mandated AML protocols and resigned from his CEO position. On the other hand, Binance settled associated accusations by [paying $4.3 billion.](https://coinedition.com/prosecutors-urge-court-to-accept-binances-4-3-billion-plea-deal/)

Before the Tuesday court pronouncement, the prosecutor contended that Zhao willfully disregarded illegal transactions, thus seeking a prison term of over three years for him. However, the judge disagreed with their recommended sentence.

Following the court judgment, CZ took to X to emphasize that the industry has transitioned into a new phase. He highlighted that compliance is now super crucial for the industry to grow and mature. Also, CZ pointed out that a silver lining of the entire process is that it has put Binance under scrutiny, giving more assurance that “Funds are SAFU.” 

Meanwhile, Zhao disclosed his intention to wrap up the challenging phase and shift his focus to education. Furthermore, he affirmed his commitment to remaining a passive crypto investor.  
Prominent figures in the crypto space, like Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant, [expressed](https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1785520510555820220) gratitude to CZ for his contributions to advancing the space and building entrepreneurs and innovators.

Chinese authorities have captured a person suspected of identity forgery related to the StarkNet (STRK) airdrop.

The suspect has assumed other people’s identities and submitted over 40 false Early Community Member Program (ECMP) airdrop forms, claiming over 40,000 STRK tokens that initially belonged to the victims.

Following the airdrop, the suspect transferred over 40,000 STRK tokens to an OKX wallet, which were converted to over $91,000 worth of Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)), according to an April 30 local media [report](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27237572).

The suspect, identified as Lan Mou, was captured by the police in the Guangdong Province on April 25, along with a computer and two mobile phones.

While scams and phishing attacks are widespread in the cryptocurrency space, identity theft for claiming other users’ airdrops on such a large scale seems to be a first.

A crypto airdrop is a way of distributing new cryptocurrency, generally for early users who interacted with a certain protocol.

The StarkNet Foundation — the organization supporting the Ethereum layer-2 Starknet network — launched a [700 million STRK token airdrop](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-airdrop-largely-successful-despite-controversies) on Feb. 20. The airdrop aimed to reward Ethereum solo and liquid stakes, Starknet developers and users, as well as projects and developers outside the Web3 ecosystem.

The airdrop saw significant interest as the first 45 million STRK tokens were claimed in less than 90 minutes.

STRK airdrop was filled with airdrop squatters
----------------------------------------------

On Feb. 20, pseudonymous Yearn.finance developer Banteg [warned](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1759923340737716287) that the StarkNet’s eligibility list mainly included airdrop squatters, or professional airdrop hunters, who only farm protocols with an incoming airdrop in hopes of financial gains.

According to the developer, approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were [allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-populated-airdrop-hunters-ahead-token-launch-report) controlled by airdrop squatters who usually farm the same airdrop with multiple addresses to compound the rewards.

In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters [consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-airdrop-sees-1-500-addresses-consolidate-3-3m-into-two-wallets) from the then Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.

![Image 1: Will Bitcoin's 10% tumble in 7 days pull these altcoins down 30% as well?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _AGIX, GRT, and APE, face potential crashes due to Bitcoin’s bearish chart patterns._
*   _Major altcoins like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana have dropped significantly as well._

In recent developments within the cryptocurrency markets, a significant downturn has been observed, with leading digital currencies including [Bitcoin \[BTC\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction) struggling to maintain their foothold.

As reported by analyst Kyledoops in a video on the [“Crypto Banter”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MANczvfQtgA) channel, Bitcoin is facing an inability to break through critical resistance levels. 

This has become increasingly apparent over the past week, with the asset seeing a notable drop of over 10% in this period, pushing Bitcoin down to a monthly low in the $58,000 range.

#### **Predictions of a 30% crash**

The downturn is not isolated to Bitcoin alone; the broader altcoin market has also experienced a substantial decline.

From a high of over $1 trillion just last week, the total market capitalization of altcoins has plummeted to $952 billion. 

Within this volatile environment, specific altcoins are under the spotlight for potential further losses, according to Kyledoops.

[SingularityNET \[AGIX\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/agix-price-prediction), for example, has already seen a 24% decline over the past week, with a further 10% drop just in the last day.

Technical analysis suggests that AGIX, along with other tokens like [The Graph \[GRT\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/grt-price-prediction) and [Apecoin \[APE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/apecoin-price-prediction), could see an additional 30% fall due to their bearish chart patterns.

Tokens associated with artificial intelligence and gaming are particularly vulnerable.

AGIX’s daily chart analysis, for instance, shows that the altcoin has shown a clear shift to a bearish trend after breaking its support structure.

Recently, it formed a bearish doji candlestick, followed by a close below this level with an engulfing bearish candlestick, signaling potential for further declines.

[![Image 2](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201383'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/agix-tv.png)

Source: TradingView

As for [Fetch AI \[FET\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/fetch-ai-price-prediction), the “Crypto Banter” analyst anticipated a potential 15% decline. This projection seems plausible, given that Fetch AI’s chart pattern closely mirrors that of AGIX, which has already signaled further downward movement.

APE, on the other hand, might see its value drop to around $1, marking a potential 20% decrease or even setting new lows.

This prediction is supported by its daily chart, which shows a crucial swing low liquidity level around the $1 mark that could be tested before any potential reversal.

Similarly, AXS is poised for a possible 47% drop due to the same reason, further stressing the bearish outlook.

#### Bitcoin: Far-reaching effects

Amidst these projections, the three major altcoins—[Ethereum \[ETH\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/ethereum-price-prediction), [Binance Coin \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/binancecoin-price-prediction), and [Solana \[SOL\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/solana-price-prediction) —have experienced declines of approximately 8.8%, 8.8%, and 10.9% respectively over the past 24 hours.

An analysis from AMBCrypto highlighted [Solana’s current technical setup](https://ambcrypto.com/solana-as-key-indicator-slips-47-will-sol-plunge-below-130/): a descending triangle pattern on the 3-day chart, with a support level at $128.

Should market sentiment deteriorate further, there’s a risk that Solana could breach this support and drop below $130.

ED Introduced its Crypto Wallet To Transfer The Proceeds of Crime
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, the Enforcement Directorate has launched its own Crypto wallet to tackle and transfer the proceeds of financial crime that are in the crypto denomination.  

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is a law enforcement and Economic Intelligence agency in India focusing on enforcing laws related to money laundering, foreign exchange violations, and financial crimes. The ED investigates, prosecutes, and confiscates assets to combat economic offenses.

The move by ED to have its crypto wallet came after a Big Fraud by a gaming app of Kolkata named “E Nugget app”. This app showcased itself as one the most rewarding gaming app. It promises real cash to its users but has made a big scam. ED unearthed this case in 2022 and till now has recovered 19 crores as cash and 90 Crores in Cryptocurrency in 70 different accounts maintained with [Binance](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/binance-is-back-in-india-after-paying-dollar2-million-fine"Binance"), Zebpay and WazirX.  

### Technological Advancement by Enforcement Directorate 

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is leveraging advanced technology to combat financial fraud, focusing on crimes involving cryptocurrencies. With over 900 crores seized in various crypto-related cases, the ED recognized the need to upgrade its tech capabilities to keep up with criminals' evolving tactics.

To do this, the ED has partnered with a digital firm that specializes in iPhone cracking to boost its cyber forensics capabilities. This partnership allows the ED to investigate digital evidence more effectively and catch cybercriminals in the act. Additionally, they're developing software called CEDOS, which stands for Core ED Operations System. This software connects ED officers with data from other agencies, helping them detect financial irregularities more quickly.

The ED is also collaborating with fintech companies to ensure compliance and organize workshops on cybersecurity and digital fraud. They're creating a registry to track suspicious banking correspondents and are using geotagging technology to trace the flow of money. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of data infringement helps detect unauthorized access, while regular audits of digital KYC processes ensure accountability. Through these technological advancements, the ED is equipped to stay ahead in the fight against financial crime.

#### Enforcement Directorate and the use of Crypto Wallet

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has ventured into the crypto world by adopting crypto wallets for its operations. This move has the potential to reshape the crypto market and create a ripple effect on the broader financial landscape. As ED gets more comfortable with this technology, it could lead to reduced crypto-related fraud, fostering a safer environment for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.

With ED embracing this advanced technology, there's a good chance we'll see increased confidence in cryptocurrencies across India. This could even pave the way for more extensive adoption, not just among individual users but also across various government agencies. If the agency's experience with crypto proves successful, it could trigger a new wave of digital innovation, positioning India as a leader in the global crypto space. 

Ultimately, ED's engagement with crypto might open doors for broader public acceptance and government endorsement, making cryptocurrencies a more integral part of India's financial ecosystem.

The [cryptocurrency market](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) shambled on the first day of May, following a rising fear that started on April 30. In the last 24 hours, [long-position](https://finbold.com/guide/long-position/) traders lost nearly $400 million in leverage liquidations.

Notably, recent price action liquidated 137,016 traders for $464.54 million realized losses from long and [short positions](https://finbold.com/guide/short-position/). However, only $64.67 million were from [short-sellers](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-short-bitcoin/), while $399.88 million were from [bullish](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) traders with long positions.

Of these, $168.22 million in losses occurred in the last four hours, with $153.17 million coming from the bulls. Finbold retrieved this [data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from _CoinGlass_ on May 1 at 09:30 a.m. UTC.

### Picks for you

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) and Ethereum ([ETH](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/ethereum/)) dominated the 24-hour liquidations with $165.77 million and $120.76 million, respectively. In particular, long-position traders of the two leading [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) lost $145 million and $100 million, with a 61% dominance.

$250 billion erased from crypto as long-position traders got ‘rekt’
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On April 30, the cryptocurrency market started with a $2.29 trillion capitalization, according to _TradingView_‘s total crypto cap index. On May 1, the index dropped to as low as $2.04 trillion, with nearly $250 billion (10.87%) in losses from the whole ecosystem.

Fear, uncertainty, and doubt ([FUD](https://finbold.com/guide/what-is-hodl/#h-fud)) surged as the dominating sentiments, with long-position traders accumulating massive losses.

Bitcoin price amid massive liquidation
--------------------------------------

Bitcoin led the crash of the month’s turn, accumulating over 7.5% in daily losses. As of this writing, [BTC trades in the $57,000 zone](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-plummets-under-57000-as-crypto-market-faces-bear-market-reality/).

Meanwhile, long-position traders are concerned as the leading cryptocurrency lost a key [support](https://finbold.com/guide/support-and-resistance/#h-support-definition) level of $60,000. Analysts’ projections vary from a bounce back to previous levels to further long squeezes at $54,000 and $50,000. Interestingly, the former is a key [psychological support](https://finbold.com/guide/support-and-resistance/#h-psychological-support-and-resistance-levels), increasing the likelihood of it becoming a target.

Now, [Investors eye the Federal Reserve interest rate decision](https://finbold.com/investors-adjust-their-bets-on-feds-interest-rate-cut-for-2024/). Essentially, 99.5% of the market expects rates to continue between 525 and 550 basis points. A hawkish approach could bring further turmoil as traders would opt to diminish their exposure to risky assets.

Last week, [Bitcoin ETF investors took a hit from DTCC’s decision](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-sell-off-alert-as-etfs-take-a-hit-and-money-outflows/) not to recognize collateral value from these funds. Both developments in the United States could have mined [cryptocurrency traders](https://finbold.com/guide/cryptocurrency-trading/)‘ confidence, contributing to today’s $400 million worth of liquidations.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roger-ver-tax-fraud-case/

Markdown Content:
Yesterday, a formal accusation was unsealed, charging Roger Ver, who is a renowned Bitcoin early investor, with several crimes. According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350116/dl?inline), “Bitcoin Jesus” will be facing charges of mail fraud, filing false tax returns, and tax evasion crimes. 

This weekend, in Spain, Roger Ver was arrested based on these charges, and the US government will initiate his extradition to the US to face charges on US soil.  

Roger Ver was a resident of Santa Clara and owned two US corporations that primarily sold networking and general computer equipment. The two corporations, Agilestar.com Inc. and MemoryDealers.com Inc., and Roger Ver allegedly began aggressively stacking up Bitocin back in 2011. According to the allegations, Roger Ver was also an avid promoter of Bitcoins, earning him the alias “Bitcoin Jesus.”

Dissecting Roger Ver’s alleged tax fraud
----------------------------------------

It’s alleged that on February 4th, 2014, Roger got citizenship in St Kitts and Nevis and quickly renounced his US citizenship thereafter through an expatriation process. As it appears now, this allegedly was Ver’s master plan to avoid the IRS. According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud), the IRS required Ver to pay tax returns according to US law, covering his capital gains from the sale of his assets, including Bitcoin.

Apparently, when he renounced his US citizenship, Ver was required to pay some tax, referred to as an “exit tax.” The exit tax should have covered all capital gains Roger Ver earned from the sale of his Bitcoins and other assets. 

In perspective, it’s alleged that by Feb 2014, Roger Ver and his companies owned close to 131,000 Bitcoins; among those, his two corporations, Agilestar and MemoryDealers, accounted for nearly 73,000 Bitcoins. These Bitcoins were reportedly traded on various crypto exchange platforms at the time. Notably, as of Feb 2014, each Bitcoin traded at an average market price of $871.

In the process of expatriation, Roger Ver allegedly consulted a particular law firm to help him handle tax returns related to his expatriation. In the process, he also reportedly got a valuator for the valuation of his two companies. 

Ver allegedly provided a false account of the number of Bitcoins he owned, which reportedly led to grave undervaluation of his assets, misleading the law firm and the appraiser into filing incorrect returns to the IRS. 

According to the indictment, Roger Ver’s two companies still held onto approximately 70,000 Bitcoins. During that time, Ver allegedly took control of the Bitcoins and consequently sold most of them for almost $240 million in cash on various exchange platforms. 

Roger Ver, although not a US citizen at the time, should have reported to the IRS his earnings from dividends and other gains from Agilestar and MemoryDealers, according to the indictment. 

The IRS Criminal Investigation’s Cybercrime is already on the case. Allegedly, Ver caused an estimated loss of $48 million to the IRS.

Amidst the challenging circumstances of a prison sentence, Binance founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Changpeng CZ Zhao has [taken](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488) to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to express his gratitude to those who supported him during these trying times.

Binance Founder Promises Resilience
-----------------------------------

On Tuesday, Binance founder [Changpeng CZ Zhao](https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/) was sentenced to 4 months in prison for not putting in place sufficient safeguards against money laundering. As a result, Zhao was charged with several counts of crimes such as money laundering and non-compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. 

[![Image 1: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639599248&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=18e26d6e5869861245c0046d78d6875d15f35cee&amp;location=)

During these tough times, the Binance founder received noteworthy support from those who love him. Zhao acknowledged the several types of support he received, including messages and letters, as a way to show his appreciation. An overall of 161 letters of support were sent to Zhao from friends, family, leaders in the business, Binance volunteers, and some community members, among others.

“I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form,” he stated. According to the [Binance](https://bitcoinist.com/binance-clamps-down-a-new-strategy-to-exclude-us/) founder, everyone who supported him was the reason he never gave up and they all meant so much to him. “I will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life (education),” he added.

Furthermore, Zhao has underlined his promise to remain resilient by emphasizing his pledge to continue owning and making passive cryptocurrency investments. He then highlighted the significance of adhering to laws and guidelines in the cryptocurrency sector, noting that a new phase has emerged in the industry, and it is crucial to comply with these laws.

[![Image 2: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368621&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287403&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639597255&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=dcbd06eb8fdb0135607795d4ef04845f7b6b0f18&amp;location=)

One bright spot Zhao considers throughout the case’s entire process is that Binance has been closely watched. Thus, he continues to advocate the crypto platform, affirming that users’ funds are safe and secured. 

The Sentence Was Less Than Initial Request
------------------------------------------

It is worth noting that Zhao’s 4-month prison sentence was far from the 36 months the Department of Justice (DOJ) had [requested](https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-binance-founder-zhao-3-years-in-jail/), and it is only marginally worse than CZ’s counsel’s probation-only suggestion. The Justice Department had requested a 36-month term for Zhao, claiming that his legal violations were unprecedented in scope.

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714563639738072&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fbinance-founder-expresses-gratitude-to-supporters%2F&amp;hc=429dbf142554bf83f030d5d735f30819291a37ae&amp;location=)

While prosecutors contended that the sentence ought to correspond with the seriousness of the offenses committed, Zhao’s defense attorneys countered that their client ought to merely get probation.

[US Judge Richard Jones](https://bitcoinist.com/apologetic-letter-former-binance-ceo-cz-unveiled/) argued that the DOJ’s request exceeded the guidelines for punishment during the sentencing hearing. Rather, citing no evidence that the defendant was ever informed that Binance was assisting illicit operations, Jones sentenced CZ to four months in prison.

In November 2023, the Binance founder entered a guilty plea for the multiple allegations against him and resigned as CEO of the company. Meanwhile, he was fined $50 million, and Binance was forced to pay an astounding $4.3 billion in fines.

![Image 1: Memecoin mayhem: DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI face $20.54M wipeout, now what?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _DOGE, WIF, and PEPE saw price declines in the last 24 hours._
*   _This resulted in significant long liquidations in their futures markets._ 

Leading meme assets [Dogecoin \[DOGE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/dogecoin-news/), [Pepe \[PEPE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/pepe-news/), and [dogwifhat \[WIF\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/dogwifhat-news/) witnessed a surge in long liquidations following the general market decline on the 30th of April, [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) data showed. 

Liquidations occur in an asset’s derivatives market when a trader’s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. 

Long liquidations happen when the value of an asset suddenly drops, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price rally are forced to exit their positions. 

Per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/), the prices of DOGE, PEPE, and WIF have declined by 9%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.  

DOGE liquidations totaled $12.48 million during that period, with long liquidations amounting to $12 million.

For PEPE, out of the $6 million worth of closed positions, long positions accounted for over $4 million. WIF experienced total liquidations of $2.06 million, with long liquidations reaching $1.8 million.

#### **The meme assets are at risk of further price declines**

The decline in DOGE’s price in the last 24 hours and the ensuing long liquidations have led to a spike in short trades opened.

The coin’s Funding Rate has returned a negative value for the first time since the year began, according to Coinglass.

[![Image 2: DOGE Funding Rate](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%20745'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-01-at-08.08.40.png)

Funding Rates are a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that the contract price stays close to the spot price. 

An asset’s Funding Rate is positive when its contract price is higher than its spot price, and traders who hold long positions pay a fee to traders shorting the asset.

On the other hand, when the Funding Rate is negative, it means the asset’s contract price is lower than the spot price, and short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions,

DOGE’s negative Funding Rate showed that there are more traders in its derivatives market expecting its price to fall than there are traders buying the meme coin with the expectation of selling at a higher price.

WIF’s Futures Open Interest has declined to a multi-month low. At press time, it was $249 million, having fallen by 60% since the 1st of April. 

The decline in the meme coin’s Futures Open Interest showed a rise in the number of traders who have exited their positions without opening new ones.

As for PEPE, despite a similar trend of price decline, the token’s Futures Open Interest has rallied by 79% in the last ten days, per Coinglass. 

However, its negative Funding Rate showed that more people are placing their bets in favor of a decline in the price of the frog-themed meme asset.

Blockchain oracle project Chainlink has partnered with Financial Information eXchange (FIX) connectivity solutions provider Rapid Addition to develop a FIX-native adapter for institutional digital asset trading. 

In an announcement, Chainlink said the adapter would be powered by its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), an interoperability protocol with use cases across token transfers, gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi).

![Image 2](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/34978ad9-7ea1-4417-8a33-c25574c47ac7.jpg)

_Source:_ [_Chainlink_](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1783195962430611643)

According to Chainlink, the collaboration will let banks and financial institutions send messages and engage with a “broad spectrum of tokenized assets.”

The organization believes this is an “untapped market opportunity” that could have applications across renewable energy products, carbon credits and real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, infrastructure and collectibles.

Vince Turcotte, Chainlink Labs’ business development lead for Asia Pacific, told Cointelegraph banks and financial institutions could do many things with the adapter. Like the company’s work with the [interbank messaging system SWIFT](https://cointelegraph.com/news/swift-partners-with-chainlink-for-cross-chain-crypto-transfer-project), Turcotte said that financial organizations can encode smart contracts with FIX tags and instructions. The executive explained:

&gt; “We expect this will be particularly useful for the post-trade environment, as it will allow a single source of truth for trade allocations, which can be shared simultaneously and without duplication between asset managers, brokers, and custodians.”

Turcotte added that this information can be fed into downstream legacy systems, lowering settlement error and rejection rates.

He added that the integration between Chainlink and FIX ensures existing risk and execution platforms will “interoperate” with new blockchain-based asset types.

**_Related:_** [**_Tokenization’s next phase requires real-world data integration — Chainlink_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-next-phase-real-world-data-integration)

When asked about how the new adapter may influence institutional adoption for blockchain or crypto, Turcotte expects digitally native institutions to be the first in line to adopt the integration. He explained:

&gt; “We expect that digitally native institutions will be the early adopters of this integration. These institutions recognize the value of using the FIX protocol to engage with the broader TradFi ecosystem and the value of permanence and truth via blockchain.”

Meanwhile, the Turcotte believes that asset managers and their clients could benefit from the infrastructure in terms of costs.

"Asset managers and their clients can save costs by having a single source of truth for settlement instructions available to all counterparties to a trade and constantly updated 24/7,” Turcotte added.

The Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) price has sharply declined over the past few days, which might have triggered some concerns from those who thought Bitcoin would surge after its fourth halving.

The price of Bitcoin has dropped 11% since the fourth Bitcoin halving, which [occurred on April 20](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-completion-confirmed), at 12:09 am UTC.

On the halving date, Bitcoin traded around $64,000. In the immediate aftermath of halving, Bitcoin saw a short rally, topping above $67,000 on April 22. But since then, Bitcoin has been gradually selling off, tumbling below $57,000 on May 1, [according](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) to CoinGecko data.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $57,362, down around 7% over the past 24 hours and more than 17% over the past 30 days.

The sharp decline of the Bitcoin price post-halving might have surprised someone who expected BTC to start rising in the aftermath of halving in line with some of the previous halving-linked cycles.

As previously mentioned, Bitcoin halvings have been historically associated with [post-halving rallies](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter), usually coming in about a year or more. For example, Bitcoin skyrocketed about 3,000% in 17 months after halving in 2016, [reaching a milestone of $20,000](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-20-000-for-the-first-time-in-history) in December 2017.

![Image 2: bitcoin having cycle phases](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/060d243c-e40d-46ee-a299-89c418765a28.jpg)

However, the ongoing cycle has been very [different from the past](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-institutional-impact-price-surge) in terms of Bitcoin halving characteristics. One such difference is that Bitcoin experienced an extraordinary bull run before the fourth halving, [reaching a new all-time high](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-new-73-6-k-all-time-high-etfs-eat) right before the halving event. Such a price trajectory has never been seen before in the history of Bitcoin.

“What’s unique about this latest Bitcoin halving is the incredible bull run and price action leading up to it. Even considering this recent pullback, Bitcoin has still been up 35% since the start of the year,” Quantum Economics founder [Mati Greenspan](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2021/mati-greenspan) told Cointelegraph.

Greenspan noted that the current drop in the price of BTC was somewhat expected in the context of a decline in the stock market and economic circumstances, stating:

&gt; “Considering the expectation of yet another Fed pivot and what’s happening in the stock market, Bitcoin’s current price action is hardly a surprise. We’ll be a lot smarter about that later today, though.”

Some crypto analysts have previously predicted that Bitcoin will drop following the fourth halving. In March 2024, Bitcoin analysts from JPMorgan [predicted](https://www.theblock.co/post/279833/jpmorgan-bitcoin-price-april-halving) that Bitcoin could drop toward $42,000 after the halving.

According to 10x Research CEO and head analyst Markus Thielen, Bitcoin may fall to $52,000 following the halving. The analyst [believes](https://x.com/thielen10x/status/1785454835191701566) that the primary driver for the recent Bitcoin rally was the inflow of funds into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which has dramatically slowed down in the past month.

According to some analysts, including investment researcher Lyn Alden, there are [many more reasons](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-analysts-bullish-btc-price-2024) than just the halving and U.S. Bitcoin ETFs for Bitcoin to surge to new highs in 2024.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/changpeng-zhao-foresees-new-phase-for-crypto/

Markdown Content:
Following the sentencing of [Changpeng “C.Z.” Zhao](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-founders-fate-hangs-in-the-balance/), founder of [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), to a four-month prison term. The sentence occurred on Wednesday in a Seattle courtroom after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering. These fees that prosecutors claim Binance is guilty of pertain to their practices that encourage expansion at the sale of guardianship.

He tweeted after three years in prison to thank his loyal followers and clarify what he had been through in the legal system. Changpeng Zhao stated that he would responsibly serve his remaining days while working to acquire new knowledge for his education. Furthermore, he informed me that he has a Giggle Academy, a stand-alone online educational platform, in the pipeline.

However, even after Changpeng Zhao, he persistently believes that crypto has a bright future and that he will eventually still make it. He reiterated his intentions to be a silent player in the sector, quietly supporting the chosen path with his investments. In his tweets, he also highlighted the significance of conformance and users’ underhanded maintenance, which might be a silver lining of Binance being under the scanner during his trial.

**Changpeng Zhao unveils online learning hub Giggle Academy**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Changpeng Zhao, in his second attempt, has targeted education more seriously with the establishment of the [Giggle Academy](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-founder-launches-giggle-academy/). Established on a need-to-know basis in early March while in custody, Giggle Academy intends to offer free educational content over the Internet to all students. The delivery of educational topics using this platform presents students from grades one to twelve, emphasizing the teaching process that is interesting and simple to comprehend.

Among the things that will be needed are educators who can design powerful digital material. Unlike other faculty members who schedule consultation hours, Changpeng Zhao views himself as a functional unit who is an active contributor and a learner at the same time. This educational initiative is an outlook on his far-reaching sense of social good that goes beyond his main business of cryptocurrency.

Giggle Academy, a noun phrase, was officially opened and brought on a flashy logo, which was unveiled the week before Zhao’s sentencing. This logo, done with bright colors and a cheering symbol, represents the initiative’s core aspirations of bringing positivity and a way of stepping up in the domain of education.

**DOJ seeks harsh sentence, judge disagrees**
---------------------------------------------

Indeed, Changpeng Zhao’s legal arguments are ample ammunition that Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, is constantly in the headlines. He created an example in this respect, and his case brought attention to problems concerning compliance and regulatory rules within the industry. Zhao cited that exhaustive investigations would have a positive result in reassuring that user funds remain secure (SAFU) and pursuing compliance reasons; this is a case of how crypto space rewards react and adapt.

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).
&gt; 
&gt; I will remain a…

The DOJ, at first, called for a three-year jail term for Zhao with the aim that this case could be a deterrent to other actors who will commit the same crime in the future. Nevertheless, Judge Richard Jones of the U.S. District Court remanded to a more lenient term that likewise echoed what the federal probation office had suggested. Changpeng Zhao will be given credit for the time he has spent there. This can lead to his sentence being reduced significantly, and he will have to spend less time in prison.

The above matter and Zhao’s follow-up remarks hold the key to a fundamental change in the crypto business ecosystem for high levels of regulatory compliance and transparency. In addition to that, these developments are to cause the modification of future operations for Binance as well as for the whole industry because the partners will attempt to abide by the regulations and protect the interests of their customers.

URL Source: https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium

Published Time: 2024-05-01T10:52:00+0000

Markdown Content:
According to the latest data, Shibarium, the Llayer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu, experienced a surge in transaction fees over the past 24 hours. Thus, [Shibariumscan](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats) reveals that gas commissions paid in BONE, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, skyrocketed by a whopping 500%, soaring from 12 BONE to an astounding 61.47 BONE.

Shibarium facilitates transfers of Shiba Inu tokens, utilizing BONE tokens to cover transaction fees. Notably, each transaction contributes to the burning of [SHIB](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-outshines-doge-and-pepe-in-this-key-metric) tokens, with a portion of the BONE transaction fee being converted into SHIB tokens and sent to the dead wallet.

The surge in fees on [Shibarium](https://u.today/crucial-ethereum-shib-warning-sent-to-community-by-shiba-inu-rep) can be attributed to several factors - primarily heightened network activity. With the recent surge in popularity of Shiba Inu tokens amid market volatility and heightened investor interest, the demand for transactions on the Shibarium network has surged.

![Image 1: ""](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/shibar_2.png)

_Source:_ [_Shibariumscan_](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats)

Further validating this surge in online activity is the remarkable uptick in active accounts, which soared by a staggering 211%, catapulting from 1,724 to 3,650 within the same 24-hour window.

Intriguingly, while the number of new accounts did not witness a surge, it rather experienced a decline. This suggests that the surge in activity predominantly emerged from existing accounts, rather than newbies onboarding into the ecosystem.

What's next for Shiba Inu?
--------------------------

This surge in transaction fees and network activity raises important questions about the future trajectory of Shiba Inu's network and tokens.

Will this surge in fees foretell a further activity boost within the [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/billions-of-shiba-inu-shib-by-coinbase-in-24-hours-whats-happening) ecosystem? How will Shibarium adapt to accommodate the growing demand while maintaining efficiency and scalability? Moreover, what implications does this surge have for SHIB and BONE, especially considering the chaos on the general crypto market, with bearish investors seeming to prevail?

In his statement on the X platform today, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shed light on the importance of decentralized security when it comes to managing cryptocurrency assets.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Advocates Decentralized Security in Cryptocurrency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He highlighted the use of multisig wallets, a method he personally uses to protect over 90% of his own digital funds.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds 🙂
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Multisig, short for multi-signature, refers to a wallet that requires more than one key to authorize a transaction.

In Buterin's case, he uses an M-of-N setup in which he has some of the keys, but not enough to prevent the funds from being recovered. The remaining keys are entrusted to other people he trusts.

Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining confidentiality in this installation. He recommended that the identities of those holding other keys not be revealed, even to each other. He believes this approach is a way to “decentralize your own security.”

This advice comes at a time when the use of hardware wallets and the risks associated with them are under scrutiny. Buterin's method offers an alternative approach, emphasizing the importance of decentralization and trust in increasing security in the cryptocurrency space.

As digital currencies continue to gain worldwide attention, such insights from industry leaders like Buterin are invaluable in guiding users on how to safely manage their digital assets.

*   **Azuki led Tuesday’s NFT market with $1.13 million in sales.**
*   **BAYC and CryptoPunks each secured over $500,000 in sales.**
*   **Ethereum leads the intraday trading volume at around $8.5 million.**

Recent data from the NFT market shows that Ethereum’s Azuki topped Tuesday’s trading chart, printing US$1.13 million. This surge increased Azuki’s total sales volume to US$1.12 billion, making it the eighth-largest NFT collection.

According to data from [CryptoSlam](https://www.cryptoslam.io/), Azuki was the only NFT to hit the $1 million mark on Tuesday, as sales fell to a low of $2 million for the first time since April 12.

Moreover, DMarket, a provider of in-game assets on the Mythos network, accumulated the second-most sales, reaching US$887,880. In addition, the Avalanche-based Dokyo collection took third place, generating US$716,860 from 948 transactions.

Meanwhile, collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks saw impressive outings, each securing just over US$500,000 in sales. Yuga Labs’ recent restructuring news has triggered an uptick in BAYC’s market performance, with its trading volume soaring by 80% to 1,300 ETH ($4.2 million) on Tuesday. 

Along the same lines, BAYC NFTs sales numbers have seen over 52% jump, reaching 96. The estimated market cap also increased to 147,139 ETH ($466 million), representing roughly 11% of the total NFT market capitalization of $4.23 billion. 

Furthermore, the Bitcoin-based $WZRD BRC-20 NFTs wrapped up its most successful month, with April sales totaling US$36 million. Despite the launch of new Bitcoin-based projects like Runes on the network’s halving day, its total monthly sales dropped to US$598 million in April, down from March’s US$622 million.

Similarly, Ethereum-based NFTs saw a decrease in performance, recording sales of US$241.5 million in April, marking the lowest monthly sales since last October.

Nonetheless, the NFT market has hit an uptrend recently, prompting various blockchains and projects to witness significant rallies in value and sales. At the time of writing, Ethereum recorded the highest sales volume over the last intraday trading session, hitting about $8.5 million.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-tokenless-protocols-one-hottest-in-may/

Markdown Content:
Tokens in crypto are often a dime a dozen, quite literally. Generating a token is almost trivial; new ones are minted every minute. To counteract this glut of new assets, a group of protocols has decided to build their economy first, consolidate a community, and add the token later; hence, tokenless protocols have broken onto the scene.

The appeal of no-token projects is the potential to receive an airdrop with no requirement to make an initial investment. 

Among high-profile no-token protocols was the EigenLayer platform, which awarded “Eigen points” for re-staking LST-ETH. Currently, EigenLayer is going through an airdrop process, though immediate movement of the tokens may not be possible and the tokens are unavailable for all regions.

New Tokenless Protocols Gain Visibility in May
----------------------------------------------

Bitcoin’s RGB is a no-token protocol, which does not sell a native asset. Games and Web3 projects have also launched without a token, aiming to build up a reputation first. 

In May 2024, a long list of projects is either continuing without a token or planning an airdrop phase. 

Most protocols offer infrastructure for trading or [DeFi](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/), including exchanges, bridges, swap mechanisms or prediction markets. Despite the lack of a token, those protocols are already locking in value. 

Based on DeFi Llama statistics, more than 400 protocols are locked in above $1M, and about 140 projects with liquidity above $20M. When working on smaller projects, developers often incorporate DeFi, liquidity, and other Web3 infrastructure into their products. The biggest projects are dominated by various restaking platforms, trying to copy the success of EigenLayer.

Which Tokenless Protocol to Choose in May
-----------------------------------------

Joining a tokenless protocol may still require some form of initial deposit, such as staking, or another investment to start farming points. Protocols also go through boom and bust cycles, and not all guarantee that the points earned will be eligible for a token. The token itself would also try to survive in the market. Despite this, farming a tokenless protocol is one of the crypto opportunities in May. 

&gt; Good airdrop farming opportunities are becoming increasingly rare at this point in the cycle
&gt; 
&gt; I went through 64 of the more well-known tokenless protocols and put them in tiers based on how/if I would farm them [pic.twitter.com/CYP1i9lVAo](https://t.co/CYP1i9lVAo)

Tokenless protocols also require activity on the side of the user. Points or eligibility are earned in exchange for using bridges, trading, staking, providing liquidity, trade NFTs, complete tasks and milestones or for holding other assets. For crypto insiders, tokenless protocols may be a tool to gain additional value from activities they are doing anyway.

Tokenless Farming: Be Early, Avoid Scams
----------------------------------------

Tokenless protocols appeared in late 2023, and gathered speed in Q1 2024. User awareness means the competition is even tougher, and being early is the key to getting the highest rewards. 

The game in May 2024 is to look for underfarmed protocols, where even a few small tasks can bring rewards, which can become valuable later on.

Tokenless protocols are also aggregated for more convenient farming. It is not unusual for power users to engage with as many as 100 protocols. This is possible on networks like Solana, Sui, Arbitrum and [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/) Smart Chain, which have periods of extremely low fees. 

Farming a [tokenless protocol](https://guild.xyz/explorer) is also a matter of choosing a role and techniques that are known and comfortable for the end user. Most tokenless protocols require a wallet to engage, but may hold risks. Not all projects are audited, so getting exposed to a role in their ecosystem may be risky. Reward points also do not guarantee a favorable conversion to tokens. 

Not all tokenless protocol farming is going smoothly. One of the high-profile projects, IO.net, issued points for running a user’s GPU for security and computation. Malicious users faked their GPU data to receive points without real work. 

After the incident, IO.net resolved the bug and increased transparency, to make point distribution more fair. The project is now preparing for an imminent airdrop, while entering another reward cycle. 

What are the Risks of Tokenless Protocols?
------------------------------------------

Like all crypto trends, tokenless protocols have reached hype status. The risks range from a waste of time to a loss of assets. Other risks include Sybil attacks and exploits from malicious farmers, who may find loops in the protocol and receive outsized rewards.

It is also unknown if the tokenless protocols will continue to be successful once the farming stops. The incentives to interact with the protocols may still depend on receiving rewards. The success of tokenless protocols also depends on the viability of the underlying technology and its use cases as part of the DeFi ecosystem.

The International Criminal Police Organization for Africa (INTERPOL Africa) has confirmed the completion of extradition paperwork for Binance Holdings Limited executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who fled the jurisdiction.

INTERPOL Africa’s Vice-President, Garba Umar, [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIaM_Z_v2Y) this information during an appearance on the April 30 edition of Sunrise Daily program on local news agency Channels Television.

In the interview, Umar added that the organization is actively working with the governments of different countries by serving a red notice against Anjarwalla and presenting necessary treaties, a Memorandum of Understanding, and other documentation to facilitate his extradition to Nigeria for trial.

The Interpol official did not confirm that Anjarwalla is currently held in Kenya but noted that the fleeing crypto executive was last seen there. Umar said:

&gt; “I’m not aware but what I can tell you is that the last destination I know on my record of this guy when he fled (Nigeria) was Kenya. That I can confirm to you.”

Umar added that Interpol had contacted all countries where Anjarwalla was believed to have transited, and “we got some certain information which is not possible to share on this platform.”

Anjarwalla, who was detained with his colleague Tigran Gambaryan on [charges of money laundering](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-detained-us-exec-more-charges-nigeria) and tax evasion, [escaped custody under the National Security Adviser](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-executive-escapes-detention-nigeria) on March 22 and fled to Kenya.

**_Related:_** [**_Changpeng Zhao’s 4-month sentence a ‘general deterrence,’ says lawyer_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-prison-sentence-general-deterrence-says-lawyer)

Anjarwalla reportedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East airline. However, it is unclear how he managed to board the international flight, as his United Kingdom passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remains in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.

While Anjarwalla remained out of the country, Gambaryan pleaded not guilty to the charges.

After several weeks in detention, his wife and others are calling for his release. Gambaryan’s wife [launched](https://www.change.org/p/help-bring-former-us-federal-agent-tigran-gambaryan-home-from-unjust-detention-in-nigeria) a petition to bring him back to the United States, which had 4,161 signatures at the time of publication. Gambaryan's next [bail hearing is on May 17.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-exec-nigeria-bail-hearing)

On March 5, Binance announced that it intended to [cease all naira transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-cease-all-naira-services), effectively exiting the market. Binance also mentioned that Binance’s peer-to-peer platform [delisted all naira trading pairs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-drops-naira-government-scrutiny) in late February.

On Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were [handling illicit transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-central-bank-head-criticizes-binance-execs-reportedly-arrested) and pointed to “suspicious flows” of funds at Binance.

URL Source: https://protos.com/roger-ver-arrested-for-tax-fraud-while-promoting-bitcoin-book/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T10:42:39+00:00

Markdown Content:
Less than four weeks ago, Roger Ver published his version of Bitcoin’s 2015-2017 blocksize wars. In Ver’s first full-length book, _Hijacking Bitcoin,_ he attempted to question the Blockstream-led narrative of the user-activated soft fork that ostensibly saved Bitcoin from the miner-activated soft fork proposal of big blockers like Ver, [Gavin](https://protos.com/did-craig-wright-use-staged-laptop-at-satoshi-key-signing-ceremony/) [Andresen](https://protos.com/did-craig-wright-use-staged-laptop-at-satoshi-key-signing-ceremony/), Mike Hearn, [Calvin](https://protos.com/calvin-ayre-leaves-x-after-court-finds-craig-wright-is-not-satoshi/) [Ayre](https://protos.com/calvin-ayre-leaves-x-after-court-finds-craig-wright-is-not-satoshi/), Jihan Wu, and [Craig Wright](https://protos.com/craig-wright-is-not-satoshi-nakamoto-judge-rules/).

A few days later, authorities arrested Ver in Spain for unrelated tax fraud.

The unfortunate sequence of events continues something of a trend in Ver’s life. His idealism has frequently led to encounters with law enforcement. In 2002, for example, he spent 10 months in prison for selling prohibited items (mainly firecrackers) via eBay.

Another detention center stay for Roger Ver
-------------------------------------------

According to a newly unsealed indictment this month, Ver allegedly **defrauded the US out of more than [$48 million](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud)**. According to the IRS, “he concealed and provided false information to his various advisors regarding the number and value of bitcoins he owned and controlled both personally and through his companies.”

Spanish authorities arrested Ver this month and are detaining him pending extradition proceedings to the US court system.

The US Justice Department (DoJ) will seek to try him in a federal courthouse for his criminal charges. In addition to demanding payment of overdue taxes plus penalties, authorities will seek a prison sentence. In national criminal proceedings, discretion is given to a federal judge to decide the ultimate terms of punishment.

As the predecessor of modern-day celebrities like Michael Saylor, **Ver was Bitcoin’s most prominent spokesperson** prior to 2017.

The Gospel of Bitcoin Jesus
---------------------------

For Ver (a.k.a. Bitcoin Jesus), Bitcoin was primarily a freedom technology — a tool in his arsenal of other self-sovereign tools like privacy tools, crisis gear, home fortifications, and guns.

Ver wanted Bitcoin’s blocksize to increase so that data storage for everyday commerce transactions would be affordable and fast. In his new book, he argues that he doesn’t regret championing the Bitcoin Cash version of Bitcoin, even though he’s widely viewed as the loser of the blocksize war.

Eventually, Ver began arguing that Bitcoin should fork its consensus node software to increase its block data storage size. Specifically, he advocated for a large data version of Bitcoin that still operates today, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Fast forward to today, and **BCH has a 99.3% smaller market capitalization than bitcoin (BTC)**. 

Defeated, he retired from his media career and lived a quieter life in the Caribbean. “I absolutely made a deliberate decision to do less media stuff,” he [admitted](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/roger-vers-next-life-cryonics-meets-crypto/). “That civil war is kind of over now.”

This month, he was traveling in Spain. Law enforcement arrested him and are holding him in a Spanish detention center.

&gt; I have no love for Roger Ver, but I won’t celebrate his misfortune.

Ex-Blockstream executive is not celebrating this week’s indictment.

Ver’s alleged tax fraud
-----------------------

According to the DoJ, Ver illegally reduced his tax liability by transferring ownership of his bitcoin to several companies in order to evade an ‘exit tax’ requirement prior to renouncing his US citizenship. That scheme failed. Simply shuffling assets to one’s own companies and claiming not to own those assets as of a snapshot date for tax purposes is classic tax fraud. Worse, Ver wrote down his plans for this type of scheme in an email, which law enforcement obtained as evidence against him.

The DoJ also alleges that Ver provided or caused to be provided false and misleading tax information to his attorney.

On Ver’s expatriation-related tax returns (IRS forms 1040NR and 8854), his attorney didn’t report that Ver owned any bitcoin personally as of March 2, 2014 when Ver furnished his statement of voluntary relinquishment of US Citizenship to a US consulate. 

To make things even worse, Ver’s attorney **incorrectly dated his expatriation** to February 3 rather than the true March 2 date.

It’s fine to legally avoid taxes, but evading taxes is a crime. Once again, Roger Ver is arrested and unless he strikes a plea deal, a jury will determine whether he is guilty of tax evasion.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/venom-foundation-launched-scam-nft-project/

Markdown Content:
Here we go again. Another day, another negative report that further exposes Venom Foundation’s utter shadiness. If you remember, last year, we wrote two exclusive [reports](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-fall-of-venom-foundation-cautionary-tale/) on the company that [detailed](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/murders-fraud-venom-networks-owner-exposed/) its inside operations and the alleged notorious secret founder, Alibek Issaev.

And now, we have been approached by [Venom Punks](https://twitter.com/venom_punks), the first-ever [NFT](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/nft/) project on the Venom network with yet another inside look at Venom Foundation, its centralization and fraud, the team that initially founded the project, and why the current team wants nothing to do with the foundation anymore.

The beginning
-------------

The journey of Venom Punks began with high hopes in late 2022, when the team behind the project first explored the potential of the Venom [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/). Envisioned as a platform that supported fair competition and innovation, Venom initially attracted Venom Punks with its promise of decentralization and support for developers. However, the reality they encountered was starkly different because Venom Foundation operates in a very centralized manner.

As Venom Punks set out to develop their project, which included launching several dApps like VenomSea and Wrapped Venom Station, they noticed a troubling pattern. Another project, venom-punks.com, not only mirrored their initiatives but also seemed to receive undue support from the Venom Foundation. This copycat project was reportedly backed by the foundation to the extent that it overshadowed the original efforts of Venom Punks.

&gt; “**_Venom Foundation seems more like a centralized chain, run like a family business. This setup could favor family, friends, and relatives, giving them advantages over other builders. For builders not close to the Venom Team, this means limited success chances._**“
&gt; 
&gt; Venom Punks

Venom Punks set up accounts on Discord, Twitter, and launched its domain in January of 2023. Venom Punks said they reported the scam collection in May of the same year after thorough research, and decided to take a stand and expose what they described as fraudulent activities by the Venom Foundation.

They revealed that venom-punks.com, despite its lack of originality, thrived with direct foundation support, overshadowing Venom Punks’ genuine efforts. The climax of their accusations pointed to a possible collusion between the foundation and venom-punks.com to clone Venom Punks’ original NFT designs and concepts. Venom Foundation’s current CEO Christopher Louis Tsu even went on Twitter to publicly endorse the scam collection.

A major turning point occurred when Slava Semenchuk, known by his Discord username Venominator, joined the Venom Punks Discord server on March 30 this year. His alleged intention was to defend venom-punks.com.

Semenchuk tried to portray the project as legitimate and gain from the original Venom Punks’ popularity, presenting himself as an innocent party caught in a misunderstanding. However, his presence and actions quickly raised suspicions among the vigilant Venom Punks community.

The Venom Punks team, equipped with solid evidence of the deceptive practices of venom-punks.com, confronted Semenchuk, who found himself unable to substantiate his claims and eventually left the server. His departure was not quiet, though.

He inadvertently confirmed the suspicions of many by exposing a direct link between the scam project and the Venom Foundation.

The clone war
-------------

The association between the scam project and Venom Foundation was confirmed by Venom Punks through multiple channels, including public discussions and promotional materials where the foundation’s support for the clone project was openly acknowledged.

These actions raised serious ethical questions. Was the foundation’s involvement a calculated move to push out the original innovators in favor of a controlled, less threatening project that they could manipulate? After all, they’re not really decentralized.

The extent of the foundation’s duplicity became clearer through the actions of the clone project’s founder. Not only did he launch a project with the same name, but he also engaged in misleading marketing tactics and false advertising, including offering nonexistent features and promotions to attract users.

When these deceitful strategies were brought to light, rather than retracting or apologizing, he doubled down, attempting to cover his tracks and continue his deceptive practices. These practices included the abrupt removal of outrageous offers, like a supposed trip to Dubai, from their website when they were called out for being unrealistic.

Moreover, the clone project’s readiness to launch on the same day as the original Venom Punks’ minting phase, as revealed by their conflicting mint date announcements, was a direct attack aimed at diverting traffic and sales from the original to the clone.

![Image 1: a screenshot of a message from the venom team](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.jpg)

A tense moment came when CEO Christopher unintentionally acknowledged the legitimate VenomPunks.com in a public response. This slip triggered a strong reaction from the venom-punks.com team, particularly their leader, who seemed visibly upset and even threatened to undermine the Venom Foundation. This reaction raises a serious question. What secret agreements are at play behind the scenes?

Despite the ongoing support from the Venom Foundation, venom-punks.com has openly criticized the foundation, accusing it of being disorganized. The irony of this situation is striking. Here is a project that, despite its questionable legitimacy and the foundation’s backing, publicly denounces the very organization that supports it. Kind of disturbing.

Then came the involvement of Oasis Gallery. Official statements from the foundation described Oasis Gallery as an independent third-party dApp. However, contradicting this claim, the venom-punks.com team indicated that the gallery was closely linked to the Venom Foundation, suggesting the foundation had major influence or even control over Oasis operations.

The legitimacy of VenomPunks.com was further compromised when Oasis Gallery listed their collection without consent and initially marked it as verified, potentially to boost its visibility and sales. However, just minutes after realizing the implications of their actions, the foundation requested the removal of the listing from the homepage.

This rapid sequence of actions demonstrated a deliberate attempt to manipulate market visibility to favor the scam project over the legitimate creators. When Venom Punks requested the removal of their collection from Oasis Gallery to maintain control over their project’s presentation and sales, their requests were blatantly ignored.

Internal struggles
------------------

The Venom Foundation has been facing some serious internal and financial challenges, starting with the departure of former CEO Mustafa Kheriba. The reasons behind the delayed launch of its mainnet are deeply tied to the organizational shake-up and the parting ways of Kheriba’s financial investment company with the foundation.

Post-Kheriba, the Venom Foundation experienced operational difficulties, primarily because it outsourced most tasks and its team worked remotely. The setup began to crumble as financial constraints became apparent. The lack of adequate compensation led to a mass exodus of professionals who were essential to the foundation’s operations, leaving the foundation struggling with an underqualified and understaffed team.

Further complicating matters, VenomPunks.com claimed to have uncovered troubling inconsistencies within the Venom ecosystem, particularly with how certain data was being handled and displayed. For instance, VenomArt and VenomScan were found displaying the total supply of the “Drunk Soda” collection as 2,750, despite the smart contract showing a total of zero.

![Image 2: a screen shot of a website showing a cartoon character](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png)

_Source: Venom Punks_

This discrepancy raises serious questions about the reliability of the foundation’s technology and its adherence to blockchain standards, specifically the TIP4 protocol mandated by RFC2119. Finally, the VenomPunks.com team decided to confront the foundation with evidence of misconduct involving the scam project, venom-punks.com.

Initially, there was hope that presenting this evidence would prompt the foundation to take corrective actions. However, instead of addressing the issues, the foundation alerted the scam project, leading to an attempt by both parties to erase the evidence.

Venom-punks.com’s response to the exposure was to distance itself from the foundation, claiming that it was not an official project of the Venom Foundation. This claim came too late and seemed like a desperate attempt to salvage whatever was left of its reputation.

The culmination of these issues has led VenomPunks.com to make a difficult but necessary decision — to leave the Venom chain. The foundation’s inability to maintain a fair and competitive environment, combined with its failure to support and protect genuine developers, has forced VenomPunks.com to seek a new platform where integrity and equal opportunities are valued.

A security researcher was rewarded $250,000 for discovering a vulnerability that has historically allowed hackers to pull out millions of dollars from cryptocurrency protocols. 

Pseudonymous cybersecurity researcher Marco Croc from Kupia Security identified a reentrancy vulnerability in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance.

In an X thread, he [explained](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675) how the bug could be exploited to manipulate balances and withdraw funds from liquidity pools.

Curve Finance acknowledged potential security flaws and “recognized the severity of the vulnerability,” Marco Croc explained. After a thorough investigation, Curve Finance awarded Marco Croc its maximum bug bounty award of $250,000.

According to Curve Finance, the threat was classified as “not as dangerous,” and they believed they could recover the stolen funds in such a case. 

However, the protocol said a security incident of any scale “could have caused serious panic if it had happened.”

Curve Finance recently recovered from a $62 million hack in July. As part of returning to normalcy, the DeFi protocol voted to reimburse $49.2 million worth of assets to the liquidity providers (LPs).

On-chain data confirms that 94% of tokenholders approved the disbursement of tokens worth over $49.2 million to cover the losses of the Curve, JPEG’d (JPEG), Alchemix (ALCX) and Metronome (MET) pools.

According to Curve’s proposal, the community fund will supply the Curve DAO (CRV) tokens. The final amount also includes a deduction for the tokens recovered since the incident.

“The overall ETH ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) to recover was calculated as 5919.2226 ETH, the CRV to recover was calculated as 34,733,171.51 CRV and the total to distribute was calculated as 55’544’782.73 CRV,” reads the proposal.

The attacker exploited a vulnerability on stable pools using some versions of the Vyper programming language. The bug made Vyper’s 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 versions vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

[Bitcoin](https://qz.com/bitcoin-history-creation-origin-price-1851347621) has continued its April wipeout into May, falling almost all the way to $57,000 on Wednesday morning and technically entering into a bear market after [its worst month in almost a year-and-a-half](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-on-pace-for-its-worst-month-since-november-2022-heres-whats-driving-the-decline-e168ddad?&amp;mod=home-page).

The ongoing selloff, which had Bitcoin’s price sitting at $57,075 early Wednesday morning, follow’s [April’s closely watched “halving” event](https://qz.com/bitcoin-halving-event-cryptocurrency-price-buy-mining-1851406085) and comes ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Bitcoin is now more than 20% below its record high of $73,803 set in March, though it’s still up about 30% so far this year.

Bitcoin’s previous halving events, in which the reward for miners who create more Bitcoin is cut in half, has typically been followed by big rallies in the cryptocurrency’s price. [But analysts had warned that might not be the case this time](https://qz.com/bitcoin-bicoin-halving-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-1851418943).

Bitcoin continued to shed its value Tuesday as Hong Kong’s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs failed to impress investors on their debut. [Recently, six crypto-related ETFs were listed](https://qz.com/bitcoin-hong-kong-etf-1851410344) on the Hong Kong exchange. Bitcoin ETFs contributed $8.5 million in volume, while Ether ETFs brought in $2.5 million. As a comparison, the issuers anticipated an initial volume of $100 million, as [per media reports](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/asias-first-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-gain-hong-kong-debut-2024-04-30/).  

Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. are struggling, too, with a total net inflow of $11 billion — which could have been much better if Grayscale’s GBTC had seen any inflows. According to [investment firm Farside](https://farside.co.uk/?p=997), GBTC has experienced outflows for over a month, totaling $17 billion since April 11. Over the past three days, Fidelity’s FBTC also has witnessed continuous outflows totaling $31 million.  

The current price drop follows a period of stability during which [Bitcoin performed well](https://qz.com/bitcoin-up-after-halving-66000-1851426185) after going through [its “halving” process.](https://qz.com/bitcoin-halving-event-cryptocurrency-price-buy-mining-1851406085) The recent drop in cryptocurrency prices is due to investor jitters as [the Federal Reserve reveals it has no plans](https://qz.com/dow-jones-rate-cuts-inflation-federal-reserve-1851414249) to cut interest rates soon, and fears of stagflation [are on the rise.](https://qz.com/jamie-dimon-recession-us-economy-consumers-stagflation-1851431819)

**TL;DR**

*   Despite recent price drops in the cryptocurrency market, including bitcoin, some investors seem interested in potential purchasing opportunities, reflected by increased searches for “buy the dip crypto.”
*   On-chain metrics like the MVRV ratio and shifts in open interest suggest a potential turnaround, indicating it might be a good time to invest in the primary digital asset.

Viewing the Crypto Crash as a Buying Opportunity
------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency sector has been in a state of severe correction in the past few weeks, with the situation intensifying today (May 1).

The global crypto market capitalization plunged to approximately $2.2 billion, while bitcoin’s price [tumbled](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) below $57,000 (per CoinGecko’s data) for the first time since late February. Popular altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have performed even worse, witnessing double-digit declines on a daily scale.

However, one important indicator hints that some investors remain unfazed, viewing the current grim reality as a great chance to enter the crypto ecosystem at a discount. According to Google Trends, searches for the phrase “buy the dip crypto” [spiked](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en) [](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=buy%20the%20dip%20crypto&amp;hl=en)to a level unseen since May 2022. The overall sentiment in the crypto market has turned neutral for the first time in three months, which it spent in “greedy” territory. This could be another sign that the market is done cooling off as participants’ greed has been reduced. After all, people should be “fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful,” as stated by Warren Buffett.

Optimistic Metrics for Bitcoin (BTC) Amid the Crash
---------------------------------------------------

As _CryptoPotato_ recently [reported](https://cryptopotato.com/these-metrics-suggest-it-is-time-to-buy-bitcoin-amid-btcs-price-drop-bitfinex/), several on-chain metrics signal that hopping on the BTC bandwagon at the moment might be the right choice. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator, which has been experiencing a downfall since the beginning of April, is one example.

A score above 3.5 hints that the Bitcoin price is close to its peak, whereas a result below one warns about a bottom. The MVRV ratio dipped to 2.21 at the end of February, flashing the buy signal for the leading digital asset.

Another major metric is the open interest (OI) weighted funding rate, which experienced a positive shift on April 24. According to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, the move shows rising interest in long BTC positions and a change in market sentiment from bearish to bullish.

Last but not least, we will touch upon the Bitcoin exchange netflow. The indicator has been predominantly negative in the past week, [pinpointing](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-netflow-total?exchange=spot_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=column) a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.
