[Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to "decentralize your own security," after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.

To prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig [Safe wallet](https://safe.global/).

"M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust," he wrote. "Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other."

The "[m-of-n](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/05/28/what-is-m-of-n-in-public-private-key-signing/)" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.

The conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym [0xkofi](https://twitter.com/0xKofi/status/1785294613579730966) on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds üôÇ
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.

"Your hardware wallet will be your fortress of solitude," Kofi wrote. "It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night. It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win."

But not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has co-authored a new research paper exploring how a privacy-preserving blockchain protocol could balance the need for user anonymity with regulatory compliance. The paper, co-authored by Buterin along with early Tornado Cash contributor Ameen Soleimani, Jacob Illum from the blockchain security firm Chainalysis, and two researchers from the University of Basel, delves into the subject of establishing a neutral infrastructure to incorporate privacy into blockch...

"When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself," he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.

That's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.

Although Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin.

"Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and [P](https://decrypt.co/144816/nft-artwork-owned-three-arrows-capital-sells-6-2-million-sothebys)unk6529," wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danftz) on Twitter.

How Coinbase, Grayscale, Robinhood And Binance Stack Up

One of the most interesting aspects of [blockchain](https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-blockchain/) is that everything is public. All transactions, wallets and portfolios are entirely accessible to anyone, allowing for an unprecedented amount of insight into a financial asset class.¬†

The uses of the data can range from monitoring overall trading activity and flows to seeing what the largest wallets and firms are doing with their positions. Arkham Intelligence is a blockchain analytics platform particularly interested in the second application. It cross-references financial disclosures by firms and individuals with on-chain activity to match up entities with specific wallet addresses.¬†

*   **Dogecoin millionaires are increasing ‚Äî [**investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/dogecoin-millionaires-adv)**
*   **According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, [**here‚Äôs why it can be true**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/adv-6eth).**

With Arkham's insights, anyone can see how the largest entities in crypto are trading. One interesting application is looking at the largest firms in the space.

Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the world, operates a centralized exchange, wallet service and a layer-2 called Base. [Coinbase's portfolio](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/coinbase) is worth nearly $80 billion. The wallet is composed almost entirely of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The firm holds over 900,000 BTC, currently worth over $55 billion. It also holds over 6.6 million ETH worth roughly $20 billion.¬†

While Coinbase operates as a crypto custodian, Grayscale is a crypto asset manager. It creates a handful of funds and ETFs that allow investors to access crypto products. In January, it was one of the first companies to offer a [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-spot-bitcoin-etfs) converted from a previously released futures ETF. Grayscale's portfolio has more than 99% of its value in ETH and BTC. It owns 303,050 BTC worth $18.6 billion and 2.98 million ETH worth $9 billion. Grayscale holds $27.6 billion in crypto assets.¬†

**Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, [**how much would $10 get you today**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/kraken)?**

While it is mostly known for its equity platform, Robinhood began offering crypto several years ago. The crypto platform offers a handful of the most popular tokens, but the portfolio is mostly invested in ETH, BTC and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The wallet has 140,000 BTC worth $8.6 billion, 1.5 million ETH worth $4.7 billion and 42.5 trillion SHIB worth $1 billion.¬†

As the largest crypto exchange in the world, it is no surprise that Binance (BNB) has the largest portfolio, worth over $200 billion. It holds 165 million BNB worth $94 billion, 640,000 BTC worth $40 billion, $27.2 billion worth of Tether (USDT) and 4.4 million ETH worth $13.2 billion.¬†

Coinbase has the largest ETH holding on the list. Its $20 billion of ETH is more than 5% of the total supply. The four firms hold a combined 15.5 million ETH, which is roughly 12.7% of the supply.¬†

While this may make it seem like the supply of ETH is heavily concentrated among a few entities, Coinbase, Robinhood and Binance hold assets for their customers. The portion of the supply held by these firms is under the discretion of the millions of people who hold ETH on these brokerages.¬†

Update (May. 1 at 15h00 UTC): This article has been updated to include additional information about Figment's partnership with Bitvavo.

Netherlands cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo will tap into staking platform Figment‚Äôs institutional-grade infrastructure to stake a variety of tokens on behalf of its users.

Figment, which attracted significant investments from the likes of [Galaxy Digital in 2021](https://cointelegraph.com/news/galaxy-digital-backs-50m-funding-round-for-crypto-staking-outfit-figment), [announced](https://figment.io/insights/bitvavos-digital-asset-staking-now-powered-by-figment/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_term=5-1&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=content) that it would provide staking infrastructure for the Dutch exchange. Bitvavo will stake user assets across multiple proof-of-stake protocols including Ethereum, Solana and NEAR.

A statement from Bitvavo CEO and co-founder Mark Nuvelstijn highlighted the exchange‚Äôs efforts to review and enhance its product and services. The company also confirmed that Figment is an expansion and diversification of its pool staking service providers that includes Coinbase, Copper and Kiln.

Nuvelstijn added that staking has become an integral part of the cryptocurrency industry and that the provision is an essential service for its customer base of more than 1.5 million users across the Benelux region.

The Bitvavo CEO said that working with Figment would allow the exchange to provide additional security and safety around staking and expand the offering:

&gt; ‚ÄúFigment is one of the staking infrastructure leaders in the market, and we continue to be impressed by their staking- and up-to-date market knowledge.‚Äù

Figment EMEA head Eva Lawrence said the two teams have been working together for six months with the view of spearheading the exchange‚Äôs staking services across Europe.

The partnership is set to provide access to staking rewards on Bitvavo on newly launched networks. Figment is also establishing dedicated validator nodes for Bitvavo to provide high-quality network performance and security.

The Dutch exchange has continued a steady approach to expanding its footprint into Europe. [In Nov. 2023](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dutch-exchange-bitvavo-cleared-to-operate-in-france), it announced the launch of services to French users after successfully registering as a digital asset service provider with France‚Äôs Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF).

The expansion into France followed Bitvavo's regulatory approval to offer its services in Austria. The exchange expanded its offering to Italy in 2022 and has filed registration applications for other major European markets.

Nuvelstijn previously [spoke exclusively](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-concerns-over-bitcoin-halving-supply-shock-says-bitvavo-ceo) to Cointelegraph during the European Blockchain Convention held in Barcelona in Oct. 2023, highlighting his belief that Europe's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework will allow cryptocurrency companies to offer financials services and vice versa

[Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38518143/hong-kongs-bitcoin-etf-debut-records-0-2-of-first-day-us-etf-trading-volume) (ETFs) experienced a substantial outflow of funds, totaling $162 million on Tuesday, according to financial analytics firm SoSoValue.

**What Happened**: The **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust** GBTC alone saw a [withdrawal](https://sosovalue.xyz/assets/etf) of $93.2277 million, contributing significantly to its historical net outflow of $17.303 billion. **Fidelity‚Äôs** FBTC FBTC bled $35.28 million, while **Bitwise‚Äôs** BITB BITB saw an outflow of $34.31 million. **Ark‚Äôs ETF ARKB** ARKB was the only ETF recording a net inflow, albeit a modest $3.6 million.

Following these developments, the total net asset value of **Bitcoin** BTC/USD spot ETFs fell below the $50 billion mark, landing at $49.413 billion.

**Why It Matters**: This trend of outflows contrasts sharply with the optimism surrounding the launch of new cryptocurrency spot ETFs in Hong Kong.

Harvest Global Investments and other firms received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which started trading on April 30, [according](https://wublock.substack.com/p/hong-kong-cryptocurrency-etf-first?r=jbpop&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true) to Wu Blockchain.

Notably, the initial offering of these ETFs saw significant interest from regions including Singapore and the Middle East, though Chinese mainland investors remain excluded from participating due to regulatory restrictions.

ChinaAMC led the launch with its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, boasting an initial offering size that surpassed $125 million‚Äîoptimistically compared to U.S. launches by industry insiders.

However, the actual first-day trading volume in Hong Kong reached only $12 million, dwarfed by the $4.6 billion volume observed in the U.S. market on similar opening days.

This discrepancy underscores the varying investor appetite and market dynamics between the regions.

Despite the tepid trading volume, Hong Kong‚Äôs market showed signs of growth, with the listing of these ETFs heralded as a significant development in the region's financial landscape.

The SFC has outlined a comprehensive regulatory framework for these products, emphasizing the potential risks associated with high volatility and speculation in cryptocurrencies.

**What‚Äôs Next**: Looking ahead, the [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event, scheduled by Benzinga on Nov. 19, is set to delve deeper into these developments.

### How much is Bitcoin (BTC) worth?

Today, the price of Bitcoin stands at $63,930, with a trading volume over the past 24 hours reaching $24 billion. Its market capitalization is $1.3 trillion, and it currently commands 54% of the market share. Over the last 24 hours, the BTC price has experienced a 1.5% increase. As for its circulating supply, 19.46 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum possible supply of 21 million BTC.

Bitcoin price analysis: BTC price declined heavily as it dropped toward $62K
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL; DR Breakdown**

*   BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a bearish pattern as the price dropped below $63K
*   Resistance for BTC is present at $65,260
*   Support for BTC/USD is present at $62,464

The BTC price analysis for 28 April confirms that bears sparked a solid selling pressure as BTC price plunged buying confidence by heading below the $63K mark. However, BTC price is facing a minor upward correction now.

### BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense bearish pressure

Analyzing the daily price chart of Bitcoin, BTC‚Äôs price faced a robust selling pressure as the price continued to decline below immediate Fib channels and headed toward the $62K level. However, the price is facing a surge in buying demand from the recent low. The 24-hour volume has surged to $252 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. BTC price is currently trading at $63,930, increasing by over 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently trades below the midline at level 45, hinting that a bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.¬†¬†¬†

### BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction above moving averages

The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position as they are aiming to send the price below the Fib lines. However, bulls are maintaining buying confidence and are aiming to hold the price above the EMA20 trend line.

![Image 2: a chart showing the price of btc](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BTCUSD_2024-04-28_11-37-00-1200x524.jpg)

The BoP indicator is trading in a negative region at 0.19, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.

Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed bearish candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders‚Äô confidence.

### What to expect from BTC price analysis next?

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing for further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If BTC‚Äôs price successfully holds its momentum above $65,260, it will fuel a bullish rally to $67,186.

![Image 3: btc - btc - btc - btc - btc -](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BTCUSD_2024-04-28_11-27-27-1-1200x524.png)

If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $62,464, which may begin a bearish trend to $59,942.

Bitcoin has historically presented the opportunity for significant returns due to its decentralized nature. Bitcoin also holds the potential to act as an asset that does not correlate with the broader market trends, akin to gold. This characteristic suggests that it could move independently of other assets such as stocks. Additionally, the recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it a good investment option with bright market potential.

BTC Price Overview
------------------

The price of Bitcoin had experienced notable peaks and troughs in its value. Despite this volatility, the unique nature of the Bitcoin network and its limited supply of coins has attracted the attention of investors and traders worldwide. The [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/) technology underlying Bitcoin enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems.

In recent years, Bitcoin has trended upwards, with significant increases in value occurring in 2017 and 2021. This growth has been driven by a variety of factors, including increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as speculation by investors and traders. Today, Bitcoin is trading at +56654654.6% above its all-time low in July 2010.

While the future of Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains uncertain, many experts predict that the trend towards increased adoption and acceptance of digital currencies will continue to drive demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

BTC Price history
-----------------

Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price again reached an all-time high in 2021, as values exceeded over 65,000 USD in November 2021. That particular price hike was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, whilst others in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively.

Tesla‚Äôs announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of the digital coin fueled mass interest.¬† The market was noticeably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly $17194.91 as of January 10, 2023, after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy.

Large BTC holders ‚Äì ‚Äòwhales‚Äô ‚Äì are said to make up two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, and own approx 92 percent of BTC. As most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients rather than institutional investors, Bitcoin prices are difficult to measure, as movements from one large whale already have a significant impact on this market.

More on Bitcoin
---------------

### What is Bitcoin?

Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto created the coin to overcome the shortcomings of government-issued currencies without requiring a controlling authority.

Bitcoin (BTC) was created out of the need for a cryptography-based e-payment system rather than the conventional trust-based system. Cryptocurrency acts as a store of value and a payment method for any transaction process in the crypto space. It is often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù

Bitcoin‚Äôs current cryptography is based on an impenetrable algorithm (SHA-256) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, after the collapse of the SHA-1 algorithm. This algorithm makes it impossible to crack the Bitcoin network.

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, its value has risen dramatically, from less than 0.01 USD in May 2010 to over 67,000 USD in November 2021. Bitcoin is expected to attain newer feats in the coming years as more institutional investors and traders continue to turn to cryptocurrency.

### What Influences Bitcoin‚Äôs Price?

The world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently taken a substantial hit, dipping below the $25.5K threshold and reaching its lowest value in three months. This downward trend follows a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ).

The news of this legal dispute sparked a swift wave of Bitcoin selling, causing a [ripple](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/ripple-xrp/) effect across the majority of other cryptocurrencies. The market strain has escalated as the SEC has expanded its legal pursuits to encompass Coinbase, another key contender in the cryptocurrency exchange market.

Crypto experts posit that if Bitcoin can hold its resistance level at $26,000, we might see a bounce back in the coming months. However, if this level is breached, Bitcoin could potentially tumble to its lowest ever value of $20,000.

Yet, the experts also caution that the current rise in interest rates and a more stringent monetary policy might hinder Bitcoin from making a significant recovery in the near term.

Despite these hurdles, the year 2023 holds promise for Bitcoin advocates who see it as a ‚Äúdigital safe-haven‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual gold‚Äù. These enthusiasts are confident that Bitcoin can offer investors a substantial hedge or attractive yields during periods of market instability.

### Bitcoin Challenges

Despite its success, Bitcoin has faced several criticisms, especially its energy-hungry mining system. According to an energy consumption tracker developed by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 100 TWh per year, about one-third of the UK‚Äôs total energy consumption in 2016.

In addition, BTC‚Äôs criminality potential has positioned it for more scrutiny, as it has facilitated numerous dark web dealings, such as acquiring illegal weapons, money laundering, etc.

The most significant and long-standing challenge of Bitcoin is scalability. Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying technology limits its performance in terms of transaction completion timeframe, with an insufficient capacity of 3-7 TPS. As more transactions are initiated on the network, processing delays will surface. Several proposals have been put forward to nip this concern in the bud, but a favorable long-term fix remains unclear.

### How do you buy and sell Bitcoin?

You can buy and [sell Bitcoin](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-sell-bitcoin-everything-you-need/) through cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. To purchase Bitcoin, you typically need to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, fund your account, and place an order to buy Bitcoin.

### What is Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the broader financial system?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen by some as a disruptive force that could challenge traditional financial systems and provide greater financial freedom and autonomy for users.

### Where to store Bitcoin?

The best ways to store Bitcoin include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and software wallets. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure, as they store private keys offline and require physical confirmation of transactions. Paper wallets, which involve printing out private keys and keeping them in a secure location, are also considered secure but require careful handling. Software wallets, which run on computers or mobile devices, are a great option, but more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks.

### What drives the value of BTC?

Bitcoin‚Äôs value is determined by supply and demand factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor speculation. Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature, scarcity, and high-security features also contribute to its value in the market.

Conclusion
----------

Bitcoin has gained the mainstream adoption following massive interest from institutional giants. Some companies, like the Spanish firm Telefonica, now accept Bitcoin. Telefonica even works with a cryptocurrency exchange called Bit2Me to let people pay with Bitcoin.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems to have a bright future with potential for its price to go up. This prediction is based on Bitcoin‚Äôs past prices and current market sentiment. Adding Bitcoin to your investment portfolio could be a good move, but it‚Äôs important to do your research and understand the risks before buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency

*   [Base meme coins segment loses 24% in 24 hours](#h260)
*   [Crypto liquidations near $400 million](#h348)

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) competitors on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) blockchains are under pressure as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $60,000. In the last seven days, the Base meme crypto scene lost over one-third of its value.

Base meme coins segment loses 24% in 24 hours
---------------------------------------------

The segments of Base (BASE) and Solana (SOL) meme cryptocurrencies are yet again among the most affected categories of altcoins hit by a massive crypto price flush. In the last 24 hours, meme coins on Base (BASE) saw almost 24% of their capitalization erased.

![Image 1: Base meme coins under biggest pressure](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/47837_1.png)

_Image by_ [_CoinGecko_](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories)

Among all Base (BASE) meme coins, the biggest losses are registered by low-cap assets. However, flagship coins of the Base (BASE) meme crypto ecosystem - BRETT, DEGEN, HIGHER - also witnessed 10%-15% drops.¬†

Cat-themed meme coins represent the fifth worst affected category on CoinGecko, with 17% lost overnight. However, its leaders - Cat In The Dog World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) - printed tiny 3-4% losses and, therefore, even outperformed the crypto market as a whole.

The Solana (SOL) meme coin ecosystem lost 15% in 24 hours with leaders WIF, BONK and BOME only erasing 1-6% of their prices.

As covered by U.Today previously, meme coins on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) were also hit by last weekend's price plunge.

Crypto liquidations near $400 million
-------------------------------------

In the last 24 hours, total capitalization of cryptocurrency markets plummeted by 3.9%. Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, lost 5.7% of its value.

This flush can be attributed to the end of Binance's CZ trial and the paltry start of Hong Kong crypto-based spot ETFs.

As a result, numerous Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin futures traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over $390 million in positions, mostly longs, were erased, CoinGlass's data [shows](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData).

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are responsible for $250 million of this sum.

*   **Elliptic has published new research on Bitcoin money laundering.**
*   **The latest study continues previous research published by the firm in 2019.**
*   **The firm uncovered an emerging trend in BTC money laundering.**

[Blockchain](https://dailycoin.com/tag/blockchain/) forensics firm Elliptic said Wednesday it has made significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify [Bitcoin](https://dailycoin.com/bitcoin-btc-birth-cryptocurrency-blockchain-revolution/) transactions made by illicit actors.

Elliptic published its first research in 2019 after training a machine learning model using over 200,00 transactions. In the second research, published on May 1, the firm trained the model using a vast dataset containing nearly 200 million transactions.

**New Bitcoin Money Laundering Pattern**
----------------------------------------

In a [blogpost](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai) spotlighting the new research, Elliptic said it had detected potential money laundering instances on the Bitcoin network after training the machine learning model to identify ‚Äúsubgraphs,‚Äù chain of transactions representing BTC being laundered.

‚ÄúBy identifying these subgraphs rather than illicit wallets, this approach allows us to focus on the ‚Äúmulti-hop laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors,‚Äù Elliptic said.

Of 52 ‚Äúmoney laundering‚Äù subgraphs predicted by the model and which ended up with deposits to an exchange involved in the research, 14 were confirmed to have been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to possible money laundering.

The research further uncovered new types of emerging money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin network, such as the use of ‚Äúintermediary nested‚Äù in certain ways.

Intermediary nested services include businesses that move funds through accounts at larger exchanges, often without the exchange‚Äôs awareness in the case of illicit activity.

‚ÄúNested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering.‚Äù Elliptic described.

The latest research was co-authored by Elliptic and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers.

Bitcoin miners' revenue drops to a 6-month low

URL Source: https://finbold.com/capitulation-incoming-bitcoin-miners-revenue-drops-to-a-6-month-low/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T15:13:01+00:00

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin‚Äôs ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) price shambled post-halving, with consecutive losses and the first [‚Äúred month‚Äù in April, after a 7-month green streak](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-red-alert-as-7-month-green-streak-ends-how-bad-is-it/). In this context, the Bitcoin miners‚Äô revenue in USD dropped to a 6-month low, slightly above $30 million.

Finbold retrieved [data](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/miners-revenue) from _Blockchain.com_ on May 1, showing $30.17 million of miners‚Äô revenue collected on April 30. Moreover, the 1-year chart illustrates this as the lowest revenue for Bitcoin miners in the past six months.

Notably, the most significant drop occurred after Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth halving, when the block subsidy reward changed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per mined block, drastically affecting the activity‚Äôs profitability.

### Picks for you

However, the situation worsened as the Bitcoin price in USD moved from around $70,000 to $57,000 month-over-month.

![Image 1: a graph showing the miners revenue](https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/Bitcoin-miners-revenue-1024x576.jpg)

Bitcoin miners underwater, mining with losses as revenue drops
--------------------------------------------------------------

As reported by Finbold on April 23, [Bitcoin miners are ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù with increased production costs](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-underwater-as-production-costs-surge-post-halving/), mining BTC with losses. At that time, data from different sources estimated losses from $36,000 to $52,000 per [Bitcoin mined](https://finbold.com/guide/bitcoin-mining-guide/), with BTC trading at $66,000.

Again, this situation worsened amid the most recent [cryptocurrency market](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) crash, which [liquidated long-position traders by $400 million](https://finbold.com/long-position-traders-lost-400-million-in-a-24-hour-bloodbath/). According to the previous sources, Bitcoin miners could be losing between $43,000 and $72,000 per BTC in this revenue drop.

In particular, _Capriole Investments_ has the most pessimistic production cost estimation of $128,989 per mined Bitcoin. The investment firm estimates that $77,400 is spent on electrical costs for each produced coin, considering [hashrate](https://finbold.com/guide/hashrate/#) averages.

![Image 2: a graph showing the production cost of bitcoin](https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/Bitcoin-electrical-cost-capriole-1024x728.jpg)

Meanwhile, [data](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost) from _MacroMicro_ shows a less-worse cost/price ratio of 1.66, according to estimates from _Cambridge University_. As per this data, Bitcoin‚Äôs average mining cost was above $100,500 on April 30, close to historical highs in production costs, with miners theoretically losing around $43,000 for each BTC they issue.

Therefore, current data suggests potential industry turmoil that could cause some Bitcoin mining companies to capitulate. To prevent that, the Bitcoin price would need to rally above the estimated production costs, now at all-time highs.

If the production costs remain higher than the mining rewards, measured in U.S. dollars, the Bitcoin network could centralize in a few big miners. Experts have [warned](https://twitter.com/ColinLeMahieu/status/1778052049319412079) about that for years, mentioning the Economy of Scale dynamics inherent to Bitcoin, which threatens the system‚Äôs security.

After a multi-year investigation, US authorities charged Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) with violating money laundering rules in November 2023. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine and exit the US market. The deal also involved CZ stepping down as company CEO, paying a $50 million fine, and pleading guilty to money laundering.

After months of legal limbo, Judge Richard Jones finally gave sentencing on April 30, ordering that CZ serve a four-month prison sentence. CZ responded by saying, ‚ÄúI will do my time,‚Äù and move forward after the ordeal is over.¬†

Looking to the Future

Responding to the sentencing, CZ put on a brave face, stating that he intends to serve his sentence and put the matter behind him once it is done. Looking to the future, CZ stated that he will remain a passive crypto investor and plans to ‚Äúfocus on the next chapter of my life (education).‚Äù

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).
&gt; 
&gt; I will remain a‚Ä¶
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî CZ üî∂ BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While awaiting sentencing in the US, CZ had already set in motion Giggle Academy, a [free basic education platform](https://dailycoin.com/ex-binance-chief-changpeng-zhao-teases-new-educational-project/) for young students. Notably, it will not feature any cryptocurrency-related content.

The former Binance CEO thanked those who supported him during this ordeal. He stated that the messages of support and backing kept him strong through this uncertain period of his life.

Despite the prison sentence, many in the crypto industry consider CZ a victim of the ‚Äú[war on crypto](https://dailycoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-defends-crypto-crackdown/)‚Äù by US authorities. His guilty plea to money laundering violations enabled Binance to avoid further enforcement actions.

However, in delivering the sentence, Judge Jones clarified that CZ is responsible for Binance‚Äôs compliance failings.

CZ Expresses Regret¬†
--------------------

In handing down sentencing, [Judge Jones stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison-.html) that CZ had the ‚Äúwherewithal, finance capabilities, and people power‚Äù to ensure Binance complied with money laundering regulations. However, the judge determined that CZ ‚Äúfailed at that opportunity.‚Äù

While prosecutors had pushed for a [three-year prison term](https://dailycoin.com/u-s-doj-asks-changpeng-zhao-cz-to-be-jailed-for-3-years/), Judge Jones opted to show a degree of leniency by handing down a four-month sentence instead. The relatively light punishment suggested the court recognized CZ‚Äôs conduct in trying to resolve the case as quickly as possible.

Addressing the court, CZ stated that the sentence represents ‚Äúthe first step of taking responsibility.‚Äù He admitted his failure to ‚Äúimplement an adequate anti-money laundering program‚Äù at Binance, stating, ‚ÄúI realize now the seriousness of that mistake.‚Äù

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The average** **prison sentence** **for** **money laundering** **is** [**70 months**](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Money_Laundering_FY19.pdf)**, according to the** **US Sentencing Commission****.**
*   **Since the enforcement action,** **Binance****‚Äòs global** **market share** **has** [**dropped to 55%**](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/7165350385162)**.**

Why This Matters
----------------

As much as the crypto industry paints a picture of decentralization and operating independently of legacy systems, CZ‚Äôs sentencing is evidence that authorities can pull anyone back into their jurisdiction if they choose.

### **Making A Fortune In Artificial Intelligence**

Please [click here](https://thearorareport.com/chart-analysis-stock-market-fomc-meeting-powell-rate-decision-smci-mc-05012024) for an enlarged chart of **Super Micro Computer Inc** SMCI.

Note the following:

*   This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of SMCI stock is being used to illustrate the point.
*   Super Micro has been the most favorite artificial intelligence stock of the momo crowd.¬†The chart shows the big drop in the stock on earnings released after the market closed.
*   The chart shows a 40.5% drop since the high in March.
*   RSI shown on the chart foretold what was to come.
*   The momo crowd, including momo gurus, that ran up the stock did not really understand the server business.
*   **SMCI presents an important learning moment for prudent investors.¬†These are four important points here:**
*   **What you do not buy is as important as what you buy.**¬†¬†
*   **A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.**¬†¬†
*   **The momo crowd‚Äôs history is that they make money because they run up stocks with their own buying.¬†Subsequently, the momo crowd loses money when smart money sells into the strength.¬†Often, the momo crowd loses more money than they make, resulting in a net loss.**¬†¬†¬†
*   **Follow smart money for investments.¬†Selectively follow the momo crowd for very short term trades when there is a Signal or Signal Limited.**¬†¬†
*   Members and readers of The Arora Report, already knew in advance what was to come.¬†On March 4, right near the top of SMCI stock, [we wrote](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/03/37461504/yolo-rears-its-ugly-head-in-the-stock-market-bitcoin-hits-65k-target-opec-extends-production-cuts):

*   &gt; SMCI has become a favorite of the momo crowd.¬†The momo crowd incorrectly thinks SMCI has the same potential as Nvidia (NVDA).¬†Investors need to keep in mind the following:

*   &gt; SMCI moves a lot more than NVDA.¬†SMCI is so volatile because of the small float.

*   &gt; SMCI is an assembler of servers for artificial intelligence.¬†It uses components from NVDA, Micron (MU), and Marvell (MRVL).

*   &gt; NVDA has a large moat to protect it that includes IP for its GPUs.¬†SMCI has no moat and the barrier to entry for competitors is low.

*   &gt; SMCI sales are to hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG).¬†The reason SMCI sales are booming is that they have availability of NVDA chips.¬†As chips become more available to competitors, SMCI will not be able to sustain its sales growth rate.

*   &gt; The momo crowd is buying SMCI due to lack of knowledge.¬† However, there are many investors who understand and have the knowledge of SMCI's business.¬†Many such investors are short selling SMCI.¬† For the time being, short sellers are being overwhelmed by the YOLO crowd.

*   &gt; Taking all of the above into consideration with the [quantitative analysis screen](https://thearorareport.com/zyx-quantitative-screen) of the ZYX Change Method, in an optimistic case, the fair value of SMCI stock is $442 - $486.


*   You may recall that The Arora Report was the first one to identify that artificial intelligence was real in 2022.¬†At that time, momo gurus were selling AI stock.
*   A fortune is to be made in AI between now and 2030.¬† SMCI shows that at times it will be treacherous.¬†You need expert guidance.¬† Equally important is building your knowledge of investments in AI.¬†
*   **FOMC will release its decision at 2pm ET today.¬†FOMC is expected to keep interest rates unchanged.¬†The key event is Powell‚Äôs conference.¬†The data shows that professional traders are expecting higher volatility during Powell‚Äôs conference than at any other point over the last year.**¬†
*   **In The Arora Report analysis, the near term direction of the stock market will come down to if objective Powell shows up or if political Powell shows up.**¬†¬†
*   **If objective Powell shows up, expect the stock market to go down. ¬†The reason is that the stock market is still levitating on hopium and not paying attention to the data.**¬†¬†
*   **If political Powell shows up, expect a rip roaring rally.**¬†
*   We previously shared that prudent investors should pay attention to the Treasury refunding plan.
*   The Treasury plans to borrow $243B in the April to June quarter vs. $202B estimate.
*   The Treasury has just released the composition of the borrowing.
*   In The Arora Report analysis, the composition is more important than the increased amount of borrowing.¬†Last time, the Treasury manipulated the borrowing to make stock and bond markets run higher.¬†We will be carefully analyzing the just released new data.
*   Automatic Data Processing Inc ADP is the largest private payroll processor in the country.¬† It uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture in advance of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.¬† ADP employment change came at 192K vs. 175K consensus.¬† This indicates that the jobs picture is staying very strong.¬† In The Arora Report analysis, the strength is at the low end while the job picture remains weak in IT and finance.

### **Bitcoin**

**Bitcoin** BTC/USD has fallen below $60,000 on momo crowd selling.¬† Recent momo crowd bitcoin buyers who fell prey to whales‚Äô propaganda of buying on bitcoin halving and bought bitcoin above $70,000 are panicking and selling.¬†Of course, if you listened to the podcast on bitcoin halving, you knew in advance that this was a high probability outcome.

### **Protection Band And What To Do Now**

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.¬†The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.¬†If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

**It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.**¬† When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.¬† High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

### **Traditional 60/40 Portfolio**

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

**The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Since its launch in September 2023, the TRUMP meme coin has rocketed to an all-time high of over $400 million in market capitalization but has lost over 50% of its value from that peak.

Whether Trump will sell his portfolio to realize losses is unknown.

Markdown Content:
Stablecoin issuer Tether has notched a record quarterly net profit at a time during which the company is broadening its scope.¬†

Tether tallied an all-time high net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter, according to a Wednesday attestation report by auditing firm BDO.¬†

Tether‚Äôs first quarter net operating profits of $1 billion were driven by its US Treasury holdings, the company added. Other profits stemmed from mark-to-market gains in its bitcoin and gold positions.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price hit a new peak of about $73,000 in mid-March before trending downward in April.

The $4.52 billion total obliterates the former record of $2.85 billion in net profit gathered during the last three months of 2023.

Tether‚Äôs token, [USDT](https://blockworks.co/tag/usdt), is intended to maintain a value of $1 and can be redeemed for US dollars at any time.¬†¬†

As of March 31, [Tether](https://blockworks.co/tag/tether)‚Äôs reserves were nearly $6.3 billion higher than the liabilities of the companies issuing USDT.¬†¬†

USDT‚Äôs market capitalization was roughly $110 billion at 10 am ET, behind only bitcoin and ether among crypto assets. That figure is more than triple the $33 billion market cap of competing stablecoin USDC.¬†

*   The partnership between Figment and Bitvavo underscores the growing significance of staking services in the cryptocurrency industry.
*   Both entities aim to unlock new opportunities and enhance the overall user experience by combining their expertise and resources.
*   With Bitvavo‚Äôs expansive reach and Figment‚Äôs proven track record in staking infrastructure, the collaboration is poised to reshape the landscape of staking services in Europe.

Netherlands-based cryptocurrency exchange [Bitvavo](https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/bitvavo/) is set to bolster its staking services across Europe through a strategic partnership with institutional staking platform Figment.

With a user base exceeding 1.5 million in the Benelux region, Bitvavo aims to elevate its offerings, tapping into Figment‚Äôs expertise and infrastructure to provide enhanced staking capabilities to its customers.

Expanding staking services with Figment
---------------------------------------

The partnership between Figment and Bitvavo signifies a strategic move towards offering additional security measures and expanding staking opportunities.

Bitvavo CEO Mark Nuvelstijn underscored the importance of staking in the cryptocurrency landscape, recognizing it as a vital service for their vast user base.

By collaborating with Figment, a prominent player in staking infrastructure, Bitvavo aims to fortify the security and reliability of its staking services. Figment‚Äôs comprehensive market knowledge and track record position them as a valuable partner in this endeavour.

Leveraging Figment‚Äôs institutional-grade infrastructure, the Dutch-based crypto exchange will stake user assets across multiple proof-of-stake protocols, including [Ethereum](https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/), Solana, and [NEAR Protocol](https://coinjournal.net/near-protocol/what-is-near-protocol/).

Bitvavo‚Äôs European expansion
----------------------------

Bitvavo‚Äôs expansion into Europe has been marked by steady progress and regulatory compliance.

Following regulatory approval to operate in Austria, Bitvavo successfully launched its services in Italy in 2022.

In addition, the recent approval from France‚Äôs Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF) enabled Bitvavo to extend its offerings to French users.

These expansions align with Bitvavo‚Äôs commitment to providing accessible and compliant cryptocurrency services across Europe.

&gt; ‚ÄúThis current retrace is officially the deepest (-23.6%), recently eclipsing the -22.9% retrace from early 2023. \[‚Ä¶\] Bitcoin has already eclipsed the deepest retrace in the cycle and is 13 days away from equalling the longest retrace in this cycle as well.‚Äù The pullback is 48 days long, compared to the longest retrace of 63 days during this cycle. ![Image 3: a chart of the ecb - gbp - gbp - gbp -](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/d74c32fc-4617-4950-b112-a7839cf81749.jpeg)

Similar corrections have occurred during previous Bitcoin rallies. During the 2018 bull run, Bitcoin saw five corrections of over 30% and an additional 29% correction, according to pseudonymous Bitcoin trader Sister Laura‚Äôs April 30 X [post](https://twitter.com/DecrimNat/status/1785366854602801565):

Can Bitcoin dip to $50,000 in the short term?
---------------------------------------------

Bitcoin lost a significant support level at the $59,000 mark, which also acted as the short-term holder realized price (STH-RP), or the average inflow price of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Losing the $59,000 mark could lead to Bitcoin revisiting the $50,000 mark, according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex. He told Cointelegraph:

&gt; ‚ÄúWhile price predictions are not appropriate based on these, the STH-RP is a crucial support level for BTC to hold and on losing it, or the average ETF buyer cost basis, there is a high likelihood that there is a cascade down to low $50,000s.‚Äù

Over $750 million worth of cumulative leveraged long positions would be liquidated across all exchanges if Bitcoin‚Äôs price fell below $60,000, according to [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap).

Bitcoin price fell below the $60,000 mark days after the debut of the first spot¬†[Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sell-news-hong-kong-etf-launch-btc-60k), which amassed $12.4 million in daily trading volume during the first day.

The debut of the Hong Kong ETFs generated lower-than-expected trading volumes due to the difficult macroeconomic conditions, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of DFG.

Wo told Cointelegraph:

&gt; "These ETFs were launched in different market conditions. U.S. ETFs were launched earlier this year when the market was pricing in around six rate cuts in 2024. Given the sticky inflation data, markets are now pricing in only one rate cut, which saw crypto prices tumbling recently.‚Äù

Deep learning model identifies new money laundering behaviors to enhance Elliptic's crypto transaction monitoring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has made significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify potential money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin blockchain.

In a [research paper](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai) co-authored with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Elliptic described its use of a deep learning model trained on a dataset of nearly 200 million transactions to detect illicit activity involving groups of bitcoin nodes and transaction chains.

The research builds upon a previous study conducted in 2019, which utilized a much smaller dataset of 200,000 transactions. The new ‚ÄúElliptic2‚Äù dataset contains 122,000 labeled ‚Äúsubgraphs,‚Äù representing groups of connected nodes and transaction chains known to have links to illicit activity. By training the AI model on this extensive dataset, [Elliptic](https://cryptobriefing.com/elliptic-estimates-12b-lost-to-defi-exploits/) aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting [money laundering](https://cryptobriefing.com/usdt-usage-money-laundering-surges-east-southeast-asia-un-report/) and other financial crimes on the blockchain.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The inherent transparency of blockchain data makes it well-suited for machine learning techniques, as transaction information and entity types can be readily analyzed. This stands in contrast to traditional finance, where transaction data is often siloed, making the application of [AI](https://cryptobriefing.com/ai/) more challenging.

The trained model successfully identified proceeds of crime deposited at a crypto exchange, as well as novel money laundering transaction patterns and previously-unknown illicit wallets. These findings are already being incorporated into Elliptic‚Äôs products to enhance their capabilities.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe money laundering techniques identified by the model have been identified because they are prevalent in bitcoin,‚Äù Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson explained in an email. ‚ÄúCrypto laundering practices will evolve over time as they cease being effective, but an advantage of an AI/deep learning approach is that new money laundering patterns are identified automatically as they emerge.‚Äù

The research revealed common money laundering techniques, such as ‚Äúpeeling chains,‚Äù where a user sends cryptocurrency to a destination address while sending the remainder to another address under their control, forming a chain of transactions. Another prevalent method involved the use of ‚Äúnested services,‚Äù businesses that move funds through accounts at larger crypto exchanges, sometimes even without the exchange‚Äôs knowledge or approval.

To encourage further collaboration and advancement in this field, Elliptic has made the ‚ÄúElliptic2‚Äù dataset publicly available. As the largest public dataset of its kind, it will enable the wider community to develop new AI techniques for detecting illicit cryptocurrency transactions and contribute to the ongoing fight against financial crime in the crypto space.

*   **The SEC and Ripple Labs have clashed over the validity of an accountant‚Äôs testimony in their ongoing lawsuit.**
*   **The SEC has defended her role of summarizing financial data, which is a permissible practice within legal boundaries.**
*   **The dispute has hinged on whether the accountant stuck to basic calculations or delved into expert analysis.**

The [ongoing legal battle](https://dailycoin.com/sec-vs-ripple-will-lawsuit-decide-fate-crypto-industry/) between the [SEC](https://dailycoin.com/sec-and-crypto-us-regulator-influence-on-cryptocurrency/) and [Ripple Labs](https://dailycoin.com/ripple-xrp-xrp-industry-leader-or-cryptocurrency-dinosaur/) took a new turn as the SEC responded to Ripple‚Äôs challenge regarding the testimony of SEC accountant Andrea Fox. Ripple had sought to dismiss Fox‚Äôs declaration, arguing it constituted undisclosed expert testimony.¬†

Ripple and SEC Clash Over Expert Witness Status
-----------------------------------------------

The SEC [strongly disagrees](https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1785026413357105401), defending her work as a permissible form of summary evidence under established legal rules. The crux of the dispute lies in the nature of Fox‚Äôs contribution. Ripple contends that her role went beyond mere summarization, involving financial analysis and critical decisions about categorizing Ripple‚Äôs financial data.¬†

This, [according to Ripple](https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1782578348423573898), necessitates disclosure as expert testimony. The SEC counters this claim, maintaining that Fox‚Äôs calculations are straightforward and lack the elements of expert analysis. They argue that her work involved no specialized skills or subjective opinions, simply basic calculations derived from Ripple‚Äôs financial records.

In their defense, the SEC emphasizes that Fox‚Äôs role was to simplify large volumes of financial data for the court‚Äôs benefit. They assert that using assumptions while handling such data is standard practice for summary witnesses and doesn‚Äôt elevate the evidence to the level of expert analysis.

The SEC further bolsters its argument by citing legal precedents that establish summary witnesses‚Äô acceptable use of assumptions in court proceedings. They maintain that Fox‚Äôs work falls squarely within the established parameters of a summary witness as outlined by relevant legal procedures, which clearly define expert witnesses as those providing specialized knowledge.

Narrow Focus Raises Concerns About Industry Regulation
------------------------------------------------------

While the SEC aims to uphold the legitimacy of Fox‚Äôs contribution, the case has drawn criticism for its seemingly narrow focus. Some argue that the SEC prioritizes investor protection against missed profit opportunities over addressing broader systemic issues within the cryptocurrency landscape, as highlighted by the recent [FTX collapse](https://dailycoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-cryptos-fallen-hero/).¬†

This incident has reignited concerns about the SEC‚Äôs effectiveness in regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. The outcome of this legal battle will likely have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC‚Äôs approach to navigating the complexities of this dynamic industry.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The SEC argues that Andrea Fox‚Äôs work simply summarized financial data and lacked the complexity of expert analysis.**
*   **They maintain Fox‚Äôs role falls within the legal definition of a summary witness, distinct from experts providing specialized knowledge.**

Why This Matters
----------------

This legal battle between the SEC and Ripple hinges on the definition of ‚Äúexpert testimony‚Äù within cryptocurrency regulation. The outcome will set a precedent for how the SEC evaluates evidence in future crypto-related cases, potentially impacting the regulatory landscape for the entire industry.

*   **Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility stems from its young existence, scarcity factor, and influence of large-scale investors.**
*   **Liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market exacerbate Bitcoin‚Äôs price swings.**
*   **Regulatory developments and the introduction of financial products may mitigate Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility in the future.**

[Bitcoin](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-at-62k-can-bulls-push-past-72k-resistance/?utm_source=telegram_channel&amp;utm_medium=referral) still astounds the financial area with its thrilling price alterations. From its early ages of few cents even per coin to today‚Äôs highs reaching more than $74,000, Bitcoin‚Äôs journey has been nothing short of remarkable.¬†

However, this journey has been marked by extreme volatility, with fluctuations of over 80% in value at times. Uncovering the origin of Bitcoin‚Äôs volatile nature is crucial for the success of investors and analysts as well, because that can give an indication of the future of cryptocurrencies.

The Bitcoin volatility is rooted in a diverse range of factors which take beginnings in the characteristic of the digital currency that is very young. Unlike the aged traditional assets that have a centuries-long historical data, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are unable to maintain stability that comes from decades of influence of established market dynamics.

This first stage of the cryptocurrency development model leads to the permanent process of price discovery, when the value of Bitcoin is regularly reassessed by the market, which results in great price fluctuations in reaction on new information and happenings.

One of the fundamental contributors to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility is its [fixed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2021.1984624) supply cap of 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity factor can magnify price fluctuations as demand fluctuates against the unyielding supply limit. Additionally, the influence of large-scale investors, commonly referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù further exacerbates price volatility. Their substantial holdings allow them to sway market dynamics with significant buy or sell orders, leading to abrupt price changes.

Furthermore, the immaturity of the [cryptocurrency market](https://coinedition.com/market/) infrastructure introduces liquidity issues, wherein the capacity to execute large trades without impacting market prices is limited compared to more established markets. This lack of liquidity can intensify price swings as investors maneuver in and out of positions.

With the development of the cryptocurrency environment and regulatory frameworks taking shape, things might be changing for Bitcoin, which may moderate its volatility overtime. The emergence of Bitcoin-related derivatives shown in [spot ETFs](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-etfs-promising-opportunities-and-potential-pitfalls-for-investors/) and the evolution of market infrastructure could make the trading process more stable.

Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, who has recently been talked about with his Ethereum (ETH) purchases, spoke highly of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI).

Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, who has been talked about recently with large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) purchases, this time came to the fore with the mem token announcement.

Justin Sun, who shared the part of his speech about mem tokens at the Token 2049 conference from his account X, spoke highly of mem tokens.

At this point, mentioning Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), Sun said that he believes that meme tokens are the ‚Äúfirst thing‚Äù that distinguishes the cryptocurrency industry from traditional finance.

Pointing out that Mem tokens will never disappear, Sun underlined that launching a successful Mem Token is ‚Äúas difficult as creating a good crypto project.‚Äù

Additionally, the Tron founder argued that there is significant community support behind the success of meme tokens, and he also pointed to popular personalities who support them.

Citing Elon Musk, known for his support of Dogecoin, as an example, Sun said that DOGE and similar mem tokens with significant support will be very successful in the future.

Finally, Justin Sun described DOGE as one of the best cryptocurrency brands and reminded them of their potential in bull rallies.

&gt; Meme coins may seem unconventional, but they highlight the power of community in crypto. Building a successful project, meme-based or not, takes dedication.

[Redstone](https://redstone.xyz/), a new [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) scaling network designed for fully on-chain games and ‚Äúautonomous worlds,‚Äù launched its mainnet today‚Äîwith a number of early games already available for play.

Developed by Ethereum startup [Lattice](https://lattice.xyz/), Redstone was built via [Optimism](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-optimism-using-rollups-to-help-scale-ethereum)‚Äôs OP Stack scaling tech. But it‚Äôs much more than a rebranded riff on the layer-2 tech that also powers networks like [Base](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-base-coinbases-layer-2-chain) and [Zora](https://decrypt.co/145650/zora-launches-layer-2-nft-netowrk-battle-ethereum-gas-fees)‚ÄîRedstone has been significantly retooled for the needs and demands of video games, particularly those that use blockchain for much more than asset ownership.

‚ÄúWe've had core developers come along and make really cool contributions to the OP Stack,‚Äù Optimism co-founder Ben Jones told _Decrypt_‚Äôs GG. ‚ÄúThis is the first \[network\] that‚Äôs not just tweaking dials a little bit.‚Äù Many crypto or ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù games utilize technologies like NFTs for unique user-owned items or cryptocurrencies for decentralized economies. But fully on-chain or autonomous games also put their game logic or rules on-chain, working within the capabilities but also limitations of the decentralized technology to power playable games. ‚ÄúMost of the time, when you fully embrace the medium or the system you're building to, you tend to get more interesting results‚Äîand sometimes better harmonization‚Äîjust purely from a product development perspective,‚Äù Lattice co-founder and CEO Justin Glibert told _Decrypt_‚Äôs GG. Glibert says his team has embraced this model of building entirely on Ethereum, a ‚Äúcomputer that had to be multiplayer out of necessity, and not out of choice.‚Äù Following early experimental games like [Dark Forest](https://www.designboom.com/technology/dark-forest-one-of-a-kind-sci-fi-blockchain-game-cutting-edge-cryptography-brian-gu-gubsheep-11-15-2022/), zkDungeon, and OPCraft that his team created or helped build on other chains, they‚Äôve designed Redstone to better suit such games‚Äîand it‚Äôs open to the public.

Certainly, crypto games can be built on layer-1 networks, as well as general-purpose layer-2 scaling networks. But fully on-chain games can be held back by the way those networks are typically designed. Games need low latency speeds, for example‚Äîand with such a constant flow of player inputs, they need to cut down on the friction of interacting with a blockchain.

Redstone is built for just that, and it also features the first implementation of Plasma Mode, an alternative data availability protocol co-developed by Lattice and OP Labs. Plasma Mode allows for increased transaction throughput via an [off-chain data availability provider](https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/plasma.html), but also includes a permissionless Ethereum layer-1 feature that lets any user challenge suspicious inputs.

In short, Plasma Mode picks different kinds of design trade-offs to power games and other high-throughput decentralized apps, but also includes an on-chain capability to challenge potential threats. It‚Äôs inspired by the [Plasma concept](https://plasma.io/plasma-deprecated.pdf) that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin co-authored back in 2017 (and recently [shined a fresh light on](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/14/neoplasma.html)), and will be available throughout the OP Stack going forward.

That‚Äôs paired with MUD, Lattice‚Äôs engine for on-chain Ethereum games. It‚Äôs being used by the studio‚Äôs own Sky Strife, a tactical strategy game in the vein of Nintendo‚Äôs classic Advance Wars that‚Äôs available to play today. Other Redstone launch games also use MUD, plus EVE Online developer CCP Games is using the engine for its [Project Awakening game](https://decrypt.co/221814/project-awakening-preview-eve-online-crypto-game)‚Äîthough Glibert said that CCP has yet to choose a network for that project.

Along with Sky Strife, the [initial lineup of Redstone games](https://community.redstone.xyz/) includes titles like [Biomes](https://twitter.com/biomesAW), a Minecraft-like sandbox game; [DF Ares](https://twitter.com/DFArchon), a community-driven revival of Dark Forest; and [Downstream](https://twitter.com/DownstreamGame), which has been described both as an ‚Äúinfinitely moddable MMO‚Äù and the ‚Äúworld's first post-singularity civilization simulator.‚Äù

One of the more distinctive games on the launch list is [DEAR](https://twitter.com/dear_dyr), a game by ARPA that sounds like a cross between an abstract art project, a virtual pet simulator, and a crypto-fied social experiment. Or as an ARPA representative described it, ‚ÄúDEAR is a digital creature that transforms under the collective behavior of all players‚Äîa tug of war between two factions, whether you feed or abuse the creature.‚Äù

‚ÄúExperimental‚Äù is a fair term to describe most of what‚Äôs happening around Redstone and fully on-chain games. Some of the early games look far from mass-market in aesthetic and are built around new and unfamiliar concepts.

There are various benefits to being fully on-chain, Glibert said, such as the ability to easily deploy modifications to games and create new business models around existing games. Fully on-chain games (FOCGs) can‚Äôt be shut down or erased from existence like some Web2 games, while autonomous worlds (AWs) could yield new kinds of play mechanics and experiences.

&gt; This onchain game introduces an interplay of LOVE and HATE, with a PVP twist.
&gt; 
&gt; DEAR gamer,
&gt; 
&gt; DEAR is a creature that inhabits a dark, digital forest, with cellular components woven into smart contracts. DEAR exhibits purposeful behaviour and mimics essential human interactions,‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/gRw2c5ucHc](https://t.co/gRw2c5ucHc)

&gt; ‚Äî ggQuest (@gg\_quest\_gg) [April 24, 2024](https://twitter.com/gg_quest_gg/status/1783181178645725469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Whether there‚Äôs a business here, however, remains to be seen.

‚ÄúMost of the studios out there that have raised capital to build on-chain games‚Äînobody knows if it's actually going to be a valuable market,‚Äù said Glibert. ‚ÄúI would say most of the people that are doing this seriously, they also don't know if there's actually a mature-enough business model today to do it.‚Äù

But they‚Äôre still building, attempting to push the edges of what‚Äôs possible on-chain.

‚ÄúThere is a lot of noise of ‚Äòhow to monetize‚Äô before a FOCG actually takes shape,‚Äù ARPA co-founder and CTO Majorknight told _Decrypt_‚Äôs GG. ‚ÄúRushed monetization is the [killer of innovation](https://andrewkelley.me/post/why-we-cant-have-nice-software.html). At best, it creates one-hit-wonders like the [play-to-earn](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-play-to-earn-games-how-players-are-making-a-living-with-nfts) games we have seen and doesn't have anything to do with making FOCGs, or improving the infrastructure.‚Äù

Majorknight described the Lattice team as a team of ‚Äúyoung, talented, and driven people who focus on building the infrastructure‚Äù for such games, further praising them for attempting to empower new types of on-chain games.

‚ÄúThe original vision of FOCGs is to utilize risk-free and creative scenarios to test the possibility of new blockchain applications and push the boundary of the infrastructure, similar to the relationship between games and simulations in science/engineering and between games and GPUs,‚Äù they added. ‚ÄúWho else to collaborate with if not the team who coined the term FOCG/AWs and established this vision beyond the short-sighted monetization?‚Äù

Data shows that Bitcoin sentiment has cooled off to neutral from greed following the asset‚Äôs latest plunge to the $57,000 level.

Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index Has Returned To Neutral Levels
---------------------------------------------------------

The ‚Äú[Fear &amp; Greed Index](https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/why-crypto-fear-greed-index-sustainable-recovery/)‚Äù is an indicator created by [Alternative](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) that shows the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market.

This index estimates sentiment by considering five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media data, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.

[![Image 2: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374568&amp;setID=366606&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293217&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714581695959086&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fbitcoin-news%2Fbitcoin-greed-sentiment-neutral-57000-plunge%2F&amp;hc=e82f54966e1de3211b3861befd9e926613b51c4b&amp;location=)

The metric uses a scale that runs from zero to 100 to represent this average sentiment. All values under 46 suggest that investors are fearful, while those above 54 imply a greedy market. The zone between these two cutoffs naturally corresponds to the territory of neutral mentality.

Now, here is what the Bitcoin sentiment looks like right now, according to the Fear &amp; Greed Index:

As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is at a value of 54, implying that investors share a neutral sentiment currently. However, the neutrality is only just, as the metric is right at the boundary of the greed region.

This is a significant departure from yesterday‚Äôs sentiment: 67. The chart below shows how the indicator‚Äôs value has changed recently.

As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index has been declining recently. For most of February and March, as well as the first half of April, the indicator was in or near a special zone called [extreme greed](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-no-extremely-greedy-rebound-signal/).

The market assumes this sentiment at values above 75. As the asset price struggled recently, the mentality cooled off from this extreme zone and entered the normal greed region. With the latest crash in BTC, the index has seen a sharp plunge, now exiting out of greed altogether.

Historically, cryptocurrency has tended to move against the majority‚Äôs expectations. The stronger this expectation, the higher the probability of such a contrary move.

This expectation is considered the strongest in extreme sentiment zones, as well as extreme fear and greed. As such, major bottoms and tops have often occurred in these territories.

The [all-time high (ATH) price](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-past-70000-in-wild-week-to-register-new-all-time-high/) last month, which continues to be the top of the rally so far, also occurred alongside extreme values of the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index.

With the sentiment now cooled to neutral, some investors may be watching for a fall into fear. This is natural because a rebound would become more probable the worse the sentiment gets now.

The crypto community is witnessing a virtual showdown between Cardano Founder, [Charles Hoskinson](https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-leadership-shakeup-charles-hoskinson/) and Ripple‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer (CTO), [David Schwartz](https://bitcoinist.com/one-project-man-ripple-cto-clarifies-where-his-loyalty-lays/). The two crypto giants are clashing over Ripple‚Äôs present regulatory challenges and the allegations surrounding the [ETH Gate](https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/).¬†¬†

Hoskinson And Schwartz Embark On Heated Debate
----------------------------------------------

Tensions have flared up within the crypto community as Hoskinson and Schwartz engaged in a [fiery debate](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/eth-gate-conversation-intensifies-after-ripple-cto-and-cardano-founder-debate/) over allegations of conspiracy within the Ethereum community and [Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battle](https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-counters-ripple-motion-to-strike/) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).¬†

[![Image 2: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714581720646747&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fcardano-founder-ripple-ethgate%2F&amp;hc=c15aa05814ce05cc0cdbf456a4f5f56bbbd57739&amp;location=)

The controversy had begun when Hoskinson had publicly addressed rumors which claimed that the [Ethereum community had influenced the regulatory decisions](https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-ripple-lawsuit-part-bigger-plan/) of the Ripple case by allegedly bribing the SEC to go after XRP. The Cardano founder had vehemently dismissed these allegations as unfounded conspiracy theories lacking credible evidence.¬†

In a swift rebuttal, Schwartz [raised questions](https://x.com/joelkatz/status/1784680727742963831?s=46) about a potential conflict of interest involving [William Hinman](https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-clues-hinman-ethereum-free-pass-ripple/), the former director of the US SEC. The Ripple CTO had implied that Hinman, having financial interests in Ethereum and recusing himself, may have swayed regulatory decisions in favor of Ethereum, potentially impacting the litigation against Ripple.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt the conventional ETH Gate arguments precisely about how it came to be that the SEC drew and interpreted the line in such a way that ETH was on the good side of it and XRP was on the bad side?‚Äù Schwartz inquired.¬†

[![Image 3: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714581720647154&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fcardano-founder-ripple-ethgate%2F&amp;hc=cae214719c0e5ffc3a2ca61d23763fc4cccf240a&amp;location=)

Cardano Founder Faces Backlash From XRP Community
-------------------------------------------------

In a subsequent post, Hoskinson [criticized](https://x.com/iohk_charles/status/1784683970745213000?s=46) Schwartz for purportedly spreading false information regarding allegations about an Ethereum community‚Äôs influence on Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the [US SEC](https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-sec-completely-rogue/). He clarified that he had never taken a stance on the rumors and arguments related to the ETH Gate, rather his statements have consistently revolved around the belief that someone within the [Ethereum community had bribed the SEC to target XRP.](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/cardano-founder-ethgate-ethereum/)¬†

Responding to Hoskinson‚Äôs comment, an XRP supporter and crypto member [accused](https://x.com/quadjacksxrp/status/1784685849776468169?s=46) the Cardano founder of constantly using a preface in his posts to elicit sympathy rather than directly addressing the main problem. The member had also suggested that Hoskinson often portrays himself as a victim within the crypto community while refusing to change his opinions.

Following this, Hoskinson challenged the XRP supporter, using explicit language to demand proof that supports the claims that a member of the [Ethereum community](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whale-4-5-million-burn/) had directly influenced the legal proceedings of the Ripple and SEC case.¬†

Another community member also [accused](https://x.com/johnlen90858595/status/1784430057177432525?s=46) Hoskinson of misspeaking and misrepresenting the [allegations made by the XRP community](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-community-and-cardano-founder-engage-in-heated-clash/). The XRP supporter criticized the Cardano founder for aggravating the issues by insulting the XRP community and Schwartz, while simultaneously adopting a ‚Äúnarcissistic victim‚Äù stance.¬†

Hoskinson defended his position, [asserting](https://x.com/iohk_charles/status/1784433766615646407?s=46) that he did not misspeak, and solidified his belief that allegations involving the Ethereum community bribing the SEC were and ‚Äúhas always been a conspiracy theory.‚Äù¬†

URL Source: https://protos.com/defi-lender-pike-finance-loses-1-9m-to-two-hacks-in-less-than-a-week/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T15:47:57+00:00

Markdown Content:
Pike Finance has been hacked for the second time in four days, with losses across the two incidents totaling approximately $1.9 million.

In response to the first hack, on April 26, the team immediately paused the protocol. However, this opened up a new vulnerability that was exploited between 21:45 and 22:20 (UTC) on April 30.

Crypto security firm Ancilia quickly [identified](https://twitter.com/AnciliaInc/status/1785440926212751446) three malicious transactions on the [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6baa6332f9a3ed75e727311d6317fb636844d61d9df5e199f9f68711eb632d6f), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdac6af5695ba00b3d229574dbf7fcc326d16b9f8a52ad2620637d3022956d157), and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe2912b8bf34d561983f2ae95f34e33ecc7792a2905a3e317fcc98052bce66431) networks. Ancilia [states](https://twitter.com/AnciliaInc/status/1785452418945429981) the attacker was able to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô and take control of the Pike Finance contracts, which allowed them to withdraw the funds held within.

The stolen assets were **swapped to ETH** and [consolidated](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23#internaltx) in the attacker‚Äôs Ethereum [address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23) before being [deposited](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf8ce549fe83ecaf0d889ef5bda0b613081cefdad5bd82237e3a9014584a95d11) into privacy protocol Railgun.

The hack was [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) by the Pike team on X (formerly Twitter). The post put the losses at approximately **64k OP ($150,000), 100k ARB ($105,000), and 480 ETH ($1.4 million)** and admitted that the hack was related to the previous incident.

The last time Pike Finance was [hacked](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1783989069212799321) (three days ago), it suffered losses of around $300,000 worth of the USDC stablecoin. The resulting funds were swapped for ETH and transferred to the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash.

According to the earlier incident‚Äôs [post-mortem report](https://mirror.xyz/pikefinance.eth/M1ToE42vwEHuE6xlz0dVRQwPT0xpaRtpIIw2arOdBAM), the protocol was paused to prevent any further losses while the incident was investigated. The report also admits that the vulnerability had been reported by auditors OtterSec, but that the Pike team ‚Äúwas unable to address the identified vulnerability in a timely manner.‚Äù

However, as described in today‚Äôs [response](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to the second hack, pausing the contracts inadvertently introduced ‚Äúan additional dependency within the smart contract code.‚Äù This led to a ‚Äúmisalignment in storage mapping‚Äù which the attacker could take advantage of, reinitializing the contract and assuming full control.

Pike Finance has offered a **20% bounty for the return of the funds** and has promised to provide a ‚Äúplan to make users whole.‚Äù

The community‚Äôs opinions on this response can be seen in the Pike Finance Discord.

This in itself has, [predictably](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785607580146163876), opened up another potential attack vector as scam replies (impersonating the Pike Finance account) promise a refund to victims as part of a common phishing technique.

Markdown Content:
Las Vegas resident¬†**Glauber Contessoto**, famously known as the "[Dogecoin Millionaire](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/08/34016792/dogecoin-millionaires-holdings-drop-from-3m-to-50k-but-remains-optimistic-says-doge-will-r),‚Äù took to his social media account to throw light on the concept of fair launches in the crypto markets.

**What Happened:** The heavily followed trader argues that the presence of snipers and bots has created an uneven playing field, making it nearly impossible for average investors to compete.

"These days, there is no such thing as a fair launch," Contessoto asserts. "Snipers, people who use bots and are fucking professional at it, are who you‚Äôre going against when a coin launches." He emphasizes that, this cannot be considered a fair launch, as these players are not adhering to the same rules as regular investors.

He further warns that attempting to participate in these launches is a surefire way to lose money, stating, "They‚Äôre not playing by the same rules as you, and you will lose money 100% of the time. Stop being completely delusional." He paints a picture of snipers waiting on the sidelines, ready to "crush and destroy a project the second it goes live."

**Why It Matters:** For the betterment of the situation, Contessoto suggests that the best outcome investors can hope for is to support projects with solid teams that understand the challenges posed by snipers and bots.

He advises teams to take proactive measures to protect their projects and communities. They could buy up most of the supply and distribute it over time, allowing the project to grow naturally with a thriving community as the market cap rises.

His suggestion to investors is to focus on these types of projects rather than chasing the so-called "fair launches" that are vulnerable to snipers and bots. He also warns that as soon as the snipers dump their bags within hours of launch, they move on to the next coin that they can demolish and make endless money.

Contessoto famously watched his fortune take a drastic plunge from $3 million to as low as $50,000 when he did not sell his **Dogecoin** DOGE/USD holdings after a massive run-up.

**What‚Äôs Next**: The influence of¬†meme coins and [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment)¬†is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga‚Äôs upcoming¬†[Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/)¬†event on Nov. 19.

On the hourly chart, the rate of SOL is in the middle of the local channel, between the support of $118.47 and the resistance of $127.33.¬†

As most of the daily ATR has been passed, there are low chances to expect any sharp ups or downs by the end of the day.

On the bigger time frame, traders should focus on the bar's closure in terms of yesterday's low at $121.21. If a false breakout happens, one can expect a bounce back to the $130 zone within the next few days.

On the weekly chart, there are no reversal signals yet. The price of SOL is approaching the recently formed level of $116. If buyers cannot seize the initiative by the end of the week, the accumulated energy might be enough for a move to the crucial zone of $100.

SOL is trading at $122.43 at press time.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kyc-sends-shockwave-through-nigerian-fintech/

Markdown Content:
Four well-known fintech companies have received orders from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stop onboarding new clients. This mandate is part of a larger audit of OPay, Kuda Bank, Moniepoint, and PalmPay‚Äôs KYC procedures.

KYC concerns prompt temporary onboarding pause
----------------------------------------------

The CBN directive [influenced](https://techcabal.com/2024/04/29/exclusive-cbn-directs-four-fintechs-to-stop-onboarding/) the operation of these fintech platforms, ‚Äúthey have been put on hold for the time being, meaning those who would have had new accounts cannot continue.¬†

Each website features a notice of apology, indicating no disgrace on their account for the momentary interruption that affected them. Because no new customers are to be acquired, the continuing operation and the existing customers‚Äô deposits remain safe and sound.‚Äù

The move entails the Central Bank devising measures reflecting a series of events in which the legitimacy of the fintech platform was called into question due to loose KYC regulations.¬†

The story goes back to Fidelity Bank in October 2023, which had similar concerns about fraudulent activities restricting OPay, PalmPay, Kuda, and MonieP transactions. In turn, the banking authority implemented new KYC rules for any related financial institutions, and they focused on fintech startups as the most prominent threat.

Government crackdown on Fintech
-------------------------------

Government involvement in the fintech industry is practically the CBN directive. The alignment of the National Security Agency (NSA) and economic-related fraud agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the battle against financial misdoings exposes their undeniable effort to eradicate such acts.¬†

The EFCC‚Äôs recent blocking of over a thousand accounts involved in unauthorized foreign exchange market transactions clearly shows the extra regulatory attention the financial sector is now subject to. The industry has mixed reactions, from cautious optimism to concerns about intensifying trade tensions.¬†

While some industries welcome the assistance afforded by higher domestic production requirements to strengthen their competitive edge, others fear that worldwide trade relations may become increasingly complicated.

Although stopping the enrollment of a new customer base may disrupt business operations, the independent decision by the regulators is the right move in that it guards against regulatory infringements as it safeguards the financial risks.¬†

The recently conducted audit of KYC procedures is undoubtedly evidence of the industry‚Äôs determination and commitment to ensuring regulatory oversight.

Regulatory evolution
--------------------

However, amid these interventions, several positive policies and programs are currently being implemented within Nigeria‚Äôs financial regulatory structure.

The appointment of Emomotimi Agama as the new Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the crypto community and investors not only for the recent economy but also for the future‚Äôs crypto economy is considered by cryptocurrency enthusiasts as an optimistic move.¬†

The appointment fosters devotion among investors, controls the capital market, and accelerates economic growth. The regulatory authority and fintech start-ups are expected to collaborate to expedite the process of acquiring licenses to operate crypto exchanges in Nigeria.¬†

Some stakeholders view the selection of Emomotimi Agama as a positive outcome that vows to open a new chapter of consensus between regulators and the crypto industry, which should result in an appropriate framework for innovation and growth.

The CBN‚Äôs resoluteness against the currently ongoing activities of e-currency firms, which has led to the central bank‚Äôs ban on their customer onboarding operations, further explains the necessity of the KYC process for the financial system.¬†Although they might be less desirable in the short run, such regulatory measures were intended to control standards of compliance and financial risks.

URL Source: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/an-eth-etf-wouldnt-deliver-full-returns-to-investors/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T16:00:00Z

_ETFs bring awareness but are less effective than private funds as an ETH investment vehicle._

With the recent approval, launch and success of [spot bitcoin ETFs](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/19/bitcoin-spot-etfs-register-five-day-withdrawals-streak-ahead-of-halving/), all eyes have turned to the possibility of spot ETH ETF regulatory approval, an outcome we believe to be unlikely under the current administration. Additionally, an ETH ETF will, at least initially, lack a staking reward component, a key aspect of ETH total return.

We see the primary value of crypto-ETFs being the _normalization_ of crypto investing for traditional finance allocators. Large ETF providers entering the space license their legitimacy, allowing allocators to invest in crypto without taking career-risk. However, for all the industry benefits of a spot ETH ETF, the return characteristics are not as attractive as total return options.

At the time of writing, rewards from staking eth are over 3% per annum, according to [CESR, the benchmark composite ether staking rate](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr/). In other words, if an investor invests into an ETH ETF, they may be at a disadvantage compared to someone investing in a staked investment. CESR has been as high as 8% in the trailing twelve months.

**ETH ETFs ‚Äî A liquidity mismatch due to staking**

Mechanically, staking reduces liquidity due to the validator entry and exit queues. In the summer of 2023 the entry queue rose to 45 days due to a surge in activity. As a network security activity, staking is not designed with the liquidity needed for securitization in mind. Due to the immense liquidity demands of an ETF, issuers will struggle to deliver liquidity and ETH total return, including staking rewards.

**Structural Underperformance**

Passively holding unstaked ETH is akin to holding unneeded fiat currency for long periods in a demand deposit account with zero interest. Said another way, passively holding unstaked ETH will create structural underperformance and, if compared to a total return benchmark, persistent negative tracking error. From any angle, that is an untenable position for an investor.

For accredited investors, private funds offer an effective solution to achieve total return ETH exposure. Buying and staking ETH through a private fund structure does not face regulatory challenges. Managers can also match the liquidity of the fund to stake and unstake ETH on behalf of investors. With a thoughtful operational setup, there are limited tradeoffs; a private fund can be audited, benchmarked, and keep assets in qualified custody.

**Coinbase Global Inc** COIN, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Wall Street expects $1.00 in EPS and $1.34 billion in revenues as the company reports [after market hours](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings?tickers=COIN).

The stock has gained over 300% in the past year, riding with the crypto boom. The stock‚Äôs surge compares favorably to Bitcoin‚Äôs price, which rose by 103.13% over the past year. YTD, shares have returned 17.13%, lagging behind Bitcoin‚Äôs 30% stride.

Let‚Äôs look at what the charts indicate for Coinbase stock, and how the stock currently maps against Wall Street estimates.

**Coinbase Stock‚Äôs Bearish Signals Ahead Of Q1 Earnings**¬†
----------------------------------------------------------

Charts indicate that the current trend for Coinbase stock is relatively bearish.

![Image 1: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

_[Chart: Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard)_

Its share price at $203.40, is trading below key moving averages. The 5-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $213.25, the 20-day EMA at $226.46, and 50-day EMA at $219.61, indicate selling pressure and a risk of future bearish movement.

Coinbase stock is also trading below the 8-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA), all of which suggest a bearish momentum. However, the stock is above the 200-day SMA of $137.69, indicating a bullish signal.

![Image 2: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

_[Chart: Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard)_

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is -6.11, suggesting a strongly bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 40.64 is in the Neutral zone. However, since March, the RSI has been heading lower, so it could enter the oversold (&lt;30) zone in the near-term. That could potentially be bullish for the stock, if supported by other indicators.

The Bollinger Bands have Coinbase stock trading in their lower band ‚Äì indicating trader bearishness dominating the stock.

Overall, the technical indicators suggest a bearish trend for Coinbase stock, but with potential trend reversal opportunities once the RSI enters the oversold zone.

**Coinbase Stock Analysts See 34% Upside**
------------------------------------------

**Ratings &amp; Consensus Estimates:** [The consensus analyst rating](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/COIN/analyst-ratings) on Coinbase stock stands at a Buy with a price target of $169.08. However, the latest analyst ratings for Coinbase stock from HC Wainwright &amp; Co., Bernstein, and Compass Point, received in April, point toward a greener picture. These analysts have an average price target of $275, suggesting a potential upside of 34.02% for Coinbase stock.

**COIN Price Action:** Shares of Coinbase are down 1.34% to $201.20 at the time of publication Wednesday.

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/eminem-cryptocom-advertisement-silly

Markdown Content:
![Image 1: off topic with molly jane](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Off-Topic-with-Molly-Jane_20230616a-1.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024)

This isn‚Äôt going to be another op-ed about how silly it is for celebrities to do cryptocurrency ads. We all know that they don‚Äôt age well.

Instead, what I‚Äôd like to opine on is why a cryptocurrency ad with Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, falls flat in particular. If you‚Äôre going to put a celebrity in your crypto ad, you need to go all out with creativity, humor or just overall entertainment value. Eminem‚Äôs new crypto ad does none of that ‚Äî¬†it has almost nothing to do with the rapper, or crypto at all.

The rapper‚Äôs voiceover on an [advertisement for Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) aired during the Lakers NBA play-off game last week. The ad itself, just a minute long, shows a nameless, faceless boxer getting ready to face-off in a match at the Crypto.com Arena. You can hear Eminem‚Äôs voice saying empty platitudes of encouragement in the background, telling the audience to enjoy the moment, before the screen shows the somewhat infamous slogan, ‚ÄúFortune favors the brave.‚Äù

I say infamous, because Matt Damon‚Äôs 2022 Crypto.com SuperBowl commercial ‚Äî¬†where the Oscar-nominated actor was actually pictured on screen saying that catchphrase out loud ‚Äî just looked so silly in the wake of the FTX crash. Damon later gave an [awkward, pause-filled red carpet interview](https://gizmodo.com/matt-damon-crypto-com-crypto-bitcoin-1850282413), noting that he only did the commercial to support his water non-profit in a down year.

Some are [already speculating](https://www.stereogum.com/2261473/eminem-is-crypto-coms-new-spokesman-teases-new-album-the-death-of-slim-shady/news/) that Eminem‚Äôs main motivation to lend his voice to Crypto.com‚Äôs latest ad is part of a marketing push for his upcoming album. But his motivations for being crypto‚Äôs latest celebrity spokesperson aren‚Äôt important. What‚Äôs important is how soulless that advertisement is. Watching the commercial for the first time as a longtime Eminem stan, I lamented all of the missed opportunities staring me in the face.

**Read more from our opinion section:** [Crypto‚Äôs best use case? Buying goats on Twitter](https://blockworks.co/news/cryptos-best-use-case-buying-goats-twitter)

For one, this is far from Eminem‚Äôs first foray into crypto ‚Äî¬†he had his own, pretty cringey Bored Ape phase at the peak of the NFT boom, culminating in a [half-animated BAYT music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrA-slMoZ4) with none other than Snoop Dogg. That was terrible, and also funny: and Crypto.com‚Äôs pretty basic ad could have benefitted from any sort of creative reference to Eminem‚Äôs actual crypto interests.¬†

Granted, Crypto.com is not an NFT platform. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you aren‚Äôt allowed to have a sense of humor ‚Äî especially when creating a likely very expensive advertisement with a very famous, previously NFT-obsessed rapper.

Which brings me to my second point ‚Äî¬†there‚Äôs no rap. Paying Eminem to remain faceless and read a short, only slightly rhyming text over a black-and-white boxing video feels like paying [Bob Dylan to promote Victoria‚Äôs Secret](https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/i-think-about-bob-dylans-victorias-secret-ad-a-lot.html).

Eminem‚Äôs crypto ad isn‚Äôt the first since the unfortunate crypto Super Bowl. Both Coinbase and Greyscale also [put out slightly more entertaining ads](https://blockworks.co/news/nba-nhl-bitcoin-halving-ads) in the lead up to the Bitcoin halving, albeit celebrity-less ones.¬†

As I said at the top, my point here isn‚Äôt to convince the world that celebrities in crypto ads are setting themselves up for [future embarrassment](https://blockworks.co/news/celebrities-erase-ftx-ties), [loss of money](https://blockworks.co/news/what-do-tom-brady-steph-curry-and-naomi-osaka-have-in-common-an-ftx-lawsuit) and even potentially [SEC fines](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183). We already know that. And I also know that no one will stop crypto companies, especially during a bull market, from paying celebrities tons of money to promote their brands anyway. Sam Bankman-Fried set that precedent, and even with him in jail, it really shows no signs of abating.

Instead, I‚Äôd like to propose that if we are going to keep having celeb-studded crypto ads ‚Äî¬†make them really sparkle. Pay Eminem to write an entire song about trading on Crypto.com and release it alongside his new album, with a specially crypto-themed music video (he already has the experience). Get JoJo Siwa to [wrap another car](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjojosiwa/video/7352686405887331630) with whatever memecoin logo, or Brooklyn Beckham to tattoo Dogecoin eyes next to his [tattoo of his wife‚Äôs eyes](https://pagesix.com/article/brooklyn-beckham-tattoos-for-nicola-peltz/).

Celebrity crypto ads, in my opinion, should only exist if they do something really creative or really silly: In other words, make them match the whimsy and creativity of this burgeoning financial tech industry. I‚Äôm not sure that any SEC lawyers would agree with me. Good thing I don‚Äôt work for the SEC.

Otherwise, make celebrity crypto endorsements illegal for all of the obvious reasons (high potential for securities fraud and misleading investors to start). In a nutshell ‚Äî¬†go silly or go home.

_I don‚Äôt care much about tech, I don‚Äôt care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve ended up in crypto._

_But because I‚Äôm missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about ‚Äî finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto._

_That‚Äôs what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major._

_It‚Äôs precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game._

_If you want to talk crypto with me, let‚Äôs go off topic._

Bitcoin and Solana non-fungible token (NFT) market registered records in daily active traders (DAT) last week, [according](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/on227-nft-marketplaces) to the research blog OurNetwork. While Solana reached its all-time high of 59,300 DAT, Bitcoin registered a peak of 25,600 DAT.

Solana‚Äôs rising DAT number represents a fourfold increase from the approximately 15,000 daily traders earlier last week. The publication attributes this growth to the influx of wallets engaging in sub-$10 transactions on platforms like Magic Eden and Tensor. Over the past week, Magic Eden has captured a significant 74% of Solana‚Äôs trading volume market share and 38% of its trader market share, while Tensor has secured 18% of the volume and a dominant 61% of traders.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs NFT trading historical peak was attributed to the anticipation of the Runes protocol launch. However, the trader count experienced a sharp decline to around 7,000 the day following the launch. Magic Eden has been the primary hub for Bitcoin‚Äôs NFT activity, commanding 82% of both active traders and trading volume over the last seven days, with OKX trailing at 16% for the same metrics.

Ethereum still reigns, but numbers decline
------------------------------------------

Despite dominating in trading volume and daily active traders, Ethereum‚Äôs weekly NFT trader numbers have been in decline over the past two years, with less than 36,000 wallets engaging in trades last week. OurNetwork points out that this is a significant drawdown compared to the 218,000 seen in April 2022.

Similarly, the weekly volume has plummeted from the $1.4 billion peak last April to approximately $100 million per day currently.

Moreover, the Ethereum NFT landscape also shows changes when it comes to marketplace dominance. OpenSea and Blur rivalry was met by the rise of Magic Eden as a competitor since its Ethereum marketplace debut in February. Magic Eden has quickly garnered over 20% of Ethereum‚Äôs NFT volume in the last week alone.

![Image 3: Solana and Bitcoin NFT trading hits record numbers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201530%20782'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Although Blur maintains a majority share with over 50% volume, OpenSea‚Äôs presence has diminished to 13.5% in the recent seven-day period. Yet, OpenSea still leads in trader count on Ethereum, attracting about 4,000 traders daily, compared to Blur‚Äôs 2,500 and Magic Eden‚Äôs under 600. Over the last two years, OpenSea has seen a dramatic 90% drop in its weekly trader base.

On the significant trades side, a transaction on the CryptoPunks NFT marketplace involved a 4,000 ETH purchase, valued at over $12 million, for a highly coveted alien punk. This sale propelled CryptoPunks to the second-highest platform by volume on Ethereum for that day, with only Blur surpassing it with $15.2 million in volume.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/investor-charged-with-tax-fraud-in-multi/

Markdown Content:
Roger Ver, a supporter and pioneer of Bitcoin, has faced criminal cases related to mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The indictment accuses Ver of hiding Bitcoin ownership, not reporting important company valuations, and evading nearly $50 million in estimated taxes.

Court documents unveilsRoger Ver‚Äôs alleged tax evasion scheme
-------------------------------------------------------------

The court documents [maintain](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) that Ver, who at the time resided in Santa Clara, California, was the owner of two companies, Memory Dealers Inc. and Agilestar Inc., which resold computer and networking hardware. Verkammen‚Äôs bitcoin history goes back to 2011 when he allegedly bought the first bitcoins for himself and his firms. He also called for coins in his articles and blogs, where he got the nickname ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus.‚Äù

He reportedly abandoned her US citizenship in 2014 by becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, just two years after obtaining her citizenship. He moved his Bitcoin assets to the wallet of a family member who had not reported capital gains.¬†

Under U.S. law, he was also required to echo that. The indictment claims that Ver intentionally underreported his asset in her appraisal by his law firm and appraiser; thus, the jurors suspected tax violation.

False tax returns and undisclosed Bitcoin sales
-----------------------------------------------

In February 2014, 73,000 bitcoins were estimated at his firm‚Äôs disposal. This fact is still in doubt, as Ver didn‚Äôt report any Bitcoin on their tax files. Moreover, Ver allegedly sold off tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2017, which roughly translated to around $240M.¬†

He never reported these transactions and missed paying the taxes due to the profits incurred. The indictment charges that Ver had committed acts that caused a minimum loss to the IRS not less than $48 million, according to the law. US DoJ Tax Division Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and US Attorneys Martin Estrada for the Central District of California published the case today.¬†

The IRS Criminal Investigation Cybercrimes Unit is spearheading the cybercrime arena. Matthew J. Kluge, an Assistant Chief in the Tax Division of the Justice Department, James Anthony, a Trial Attorney, and James, an aide US Attorney, have been essential players. Besides C. Hughes, the lawyer for the Central District of California, some well-qualified personnel are involved in the discussion as well.¬†

He now faces extradition to the U.S. as a possible option. Roger Ver‚Äôs case for tax fraud, evasion, and false filing of tax returns was the second one in a row that emphasized that tax law submission is obligatory and should keep up with the speed of the coin industry development. This allegation sheds some light on the difficulty in regulating digital assets and the authorities‚Äô persistence in confirming responsibility regarding the individuality‚Äôs whole sector. While the instance amasses, it may also revive awareness of the unfriendly, anti-investment practices in investors and businesses.

URL Source: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-euphoria-btc-distribution/

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin has finally [broken below the $60,000 support](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-nosedives-60k/) level for the first time in two months. The world‚Äôs largest digital asset has largely been in a [euphoria phase](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/usdt-dominance-falling-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-to-reach-80000/) since the beginning of the year, particularly after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. However, the current consolidation of the price of Bitcoin indicates the [euphoria might be fading](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/timing-the-breakout-when-will-bitcoin-escape-the-post-halving-consolidation/).

According to a new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin, which has been active for the past 6.5 months, looks to be fading. At the same time, the BTC distribution has entered into the fear zone and investors are now heavily weighted towards selling.

Selling Pressure Rises
----------------------

After reaching an all-time high of over $73,737 in March 2024, Bitcoin has declined by more than 18% as investors take profits. This drop in price has been accompanied by a rise in the percentage of addresses holding losses, indicating increased selling pressure. The percentage of addresses making a profit has [fallen in tandem](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/BTC) from over 99% to 86% at the time of writing.¬†

On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in its recent [report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-18-2024/?utm_campaign=woc_18_2024&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=woc_newsletter) the consolidation action. According to the Net Unrealized Profit &amp; Loss (NUPL) metric, Bitcoin has been in a euphoria mode very early in this cycle when compared to past cycles. Notably, the NUPL crossed over 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the just concluded halving amidst hype about Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

This is in comparison to the 2021 market cycle, where the NUPL was triggered into a profit zone 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving. This metric suggests the market is still in its euphoria phase for the last seven months but has cooled off significantly [due to correction](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-rally-over-leverage-drops-as-halving-highs-fade/) in the past two months.

[![Image 3: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374569&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293218&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714584833824911&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-euphoria-btc-distribution%2F&amp;hc=f009dbbebe1f44c492fac097070229784836a41f&amp;location=)

Interestingly, the report noted a ‚Äúdistinct uptick in net outflows‚Äù across all wallet sizes throughout April, indicating the current sentiment among traders. This means traders are now in a sell-side pressure across the board. Furthermore, a majority of short-term (one week to one month) holders have been posting losses on the 90-day +1sd level since March.¬†

What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?
--------------------------------

While the ‚Äúfear‚Äù rating may worry investors, a pullback after such a steep price rise is considered healthy by most crypto analysts. Many long-term holders are still [holding strong](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-3-metrics-solid-healthy-bull-market/) and are waiting for the halving effect to kick in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,899 and is down by 5.35% in the past 24 hours.

Considering the current cost-basis for short-term holders (STH) is at $66,700, and their realized price is at $59,800, many more holders in this cohort have possibly entered into the loss zone.¬†

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, $59,800 is a [key price level](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/59800-important-level-bitcoin/) to watch, as history has shown Bitcoin tends to bounce over the STH realized price.

*   **Vitalik Buterin uses a multi-sig wallet for 90% of his crypto to enhance security.**
*   **He recommended a multi-sig solution to minimize the personal risks of hardware wallets.**¬†
*   **In a multi-sig solution, users hold some keys but are insufficient to recover the funds independently.**

[Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin](https://coinedition.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-under-fire-after-sending-325k-to-privacy-protocol/) has explained why as much as 90% of his personal crypto funds are secured through a multi-signature hardware wallet solution. Buterin revealed this information while commenting on a trend urging crypto users to migrate to hardware wallet solutions.

Crypto data analyst Kofi [sparked](https://x.com/0xKofi/status/1785294613579730966) the conversion by painting a scenario where crypto users woke up one day and discovered their investments had been stolen. Notably, stories of devastating losses are rampant in the crypto scene, particularly as the bull market gains momentum.¬†

As crypto enthusiasts participate in airdrop activities and other endeavors, they become susceptible to [bad actors who create similar but fraudulent activities](https://coinedition.com/investigation-shows-655000-solana-valued-122-5m-sent-to-scam-presales/) intended to steal their seed phrase to ultimately drain their wallets.

Renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT recently [uncovered](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1784935501935390930) that the Lazarus Group orchestrated over 25 crypto hacks to launder $200 million. On the other hand, security firm CertiK [disclosed](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1785262226430926997) that the crypto community witnessed exploits worth $21 million in April, often involving hacks and wallet drainers.

While utilizing a hardware wallet solution could prevent some of these exploits, the founder of the NFT trading platform Reservoir contends that the primary risk shifts to the users themselves. The risks include forgetting or losing the seed phrase, especially if it is hidden too well or stored in a bank safety deposit box and becomes inaccessible due to sudden relocation.

In response, Vitalik Buterin noted that the cited concerns are precisely why he opted for a multisig service like Safe for over 90% of his personal funds.¬†

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds üôÇ
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

He explained that multi-sig setups, where multiple keys are required for transactions but not all held by the user, provide an added layer of security.¬† Typically, some keys are held by the user, but not enough to independently recover the funds. The remaining keys are entrusted to other individuals whom one trusts.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.‚Äù Buterin concluded.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) sliced through the $60,000 support on May 1, signaling that the uptrend has weakened. While the fall has muddied the short-term picture for Bitcoin, the [analysts remain bullish for the long term](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-correction-crypto-traders-indicators).¬†

Traders latch on to every bit of negative news when the price action turns bearish. Investor¬†[sentiment received a beating](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-bitcoin-ether-etfs-attract-200m-day1) on the muted response to the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that debuted on April 30. Continued outflows from the United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs [for the fifth consecutive day](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sub-60k-after-daily-crypto-liquidations-near-300m)¬†also¬†did little to soothe nerves.

Every bull phase witnesses sharp corrections, which shake out the weak hands. The lower levels give an opportunity to the long-term investors to add to their portfolios. However, it is better to wait for the price to confirm a bottom before initiating large bets.

Could Bitcoin and the altcoins start a sharp recovery, trapping the aggressive bears? Let‚Äôs analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis
----------------------

Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation resolved to the downside on May 1, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

![Image 2](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/f747a732-be81-4271-8edd-81a26247767e.png)

_BTC/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT)

Buyers will attempt to push the price back above $59,600, but the bears are likely to have other plans. If the price turns down from $59,600, it will suggest that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That will enhance the prospects of a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($66,596).

Ether price analysis
--------------------

Ether broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,170) and the $3,056 support on April 30, signaling that the bears are in command.

![Image 3](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/589a538c-e87d-4709-90f0-0a7f557004e2.png)

_ETH/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT)

The selling continued on May 1, and the bears tugged the price below the solid support at $2,852. If bears sustain the price below $2,852, the ETH/USDT pair could move downward to $2,700 and subsequently to $2,400.

Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push the price back above the moving averages. If they do that, it will indicate that the fall below $2,850 may have been a fake breakdown.

BNB price analysis
------------------

The long tail on BNB‚Äôs ([BNB](https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index)) April 30 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased at lower levels but they could not sustain the momentum.

_BNB/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT)

The bears continued selling and yanked the price below the moving averages on May 1. The BNB/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $495. This is an essential support for the bulls to defend because a break below $495 could sink the pair to $460 and later to $400.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off $495 and rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for some more time. The bulls will have to overcome the obstacle at $635 to start the next leg of the uptrend.

Solana price analysis
---------------------

The failure of the bulls to start a rebound off $126 in Solana ([SOL](https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index)) shows that the bears remain in control.

![Image 5](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/6e657e85-5ad9-450c-8d30-3c541e18503e.png)

_SOL/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT)

There is a minor support at $116, but if this level cracks, the selling could accelerate, and the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to $100. The greater the fall, the longer it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.

If bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price above the 20-day EMA ($144). That may trap the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The pair may then ascend toward the 50-day SMA ($166).

XRP price analysis
------------------

XRP ([XRP](https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index)) tried to start a relief rally from the psychological level of $0.50 on April 29, but the bulls could not maintain the higher levels.

![Image 6](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/2f0e7d51-b2a6-4235-9ec0-cbef9185d164.png)

_XRP/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT)

Sustained selling by the bears pulled the price below $0.50, opening the doors for a retest of the solid support at $0.46. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $0.46 and $0.41 because a break below it may start a downtrend.

Alternatively, if the price bounces off $0.46 and rises above the 50-day SMA ($0.57), it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The XRP/USDT pair may then extend its stay inside the $0.41 to $0.74 range for several more days.

Dogecoin price analysis
-----------------------

Dogecoin‚Äôs ([DOGE](https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index)) fall picked up momentum after the price broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern.

![Image 7](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/f5f17c7f-2b54-4503-a729-12de28b3d13e.png)

_DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT)

The bears have pulled the price below the neckline of the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. If the price remains below $0.12, the selling could intensify, and the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to $0.10 and eventually to $0.08.

On the contrary, if the price quickly rises back above the neckline, it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will gain strength on a break above the 20-day EMA ($0.15), and a potential trend change will be signaled above the downtrend line.

Toncoin price analysis
----------------------

Toncoin (TON) broke below the 50-day SMA ($5.32) on April 30, indicating that the bears are maintaining their pressure.

![Image 8](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/f5826c63-10fc-4a3d-8096-71ec5e7d9105.png)

_TON/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=OKX%3AtonUSDT)

The bulls are likely to defend the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.90 and the 61.8% retracement level of $4.25. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.58) to signal that the correction may be over. If that happens, the TON/USDT pair may attempt a rally to $6.24.

Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below $4.25, it will signal that the uptrend has ended. That increases the risk of a drop to $3.32.

Cardano price analysis
----------------------

Cardano ([ADA](https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index)) is trying to start a recovery from $0.42, but the weak rebound suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.

![Image 9](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/33707c4d-85b1-4cde-b52c-423f0fe59948.png)

_ADA/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT)

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.48) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price skids below $0.42, the ADA/USDT pair could retest $0.40 support. The bulls are likely to defend the level with all their might because a break below it may extend the decline to $0.35.

The 20-day EMA remains the key overhead resistance that needs to be crossed to suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. If that happens, the pair may attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.57).

Avalanche price analysis
------------------------

Buyers tried to push Avalanche ([AVAX](https://cointelegraph.com/avalanche-price-index)) back above the uptrend line on April 29, but the bears did not relent. This shows that the bears are trying to flip the uptrend line into resistance.

![Image 10](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/dd6ee173-ab09-46e8-b9a9-b331dff8b2a9.png)

_AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AavaxUSDT)

There is a minor support at $31.92. But if this level gives way, the AVAX/USDT pair could plummet to $29.24. The zone between $27.24 and $29.24 may witness aggressive buying by the bulls.

Buyers will have to clear the downtrend line on the way up if they want to signal a comeback. The pair could then rise to $42 and thereafter to the 50-day SMA ($45.68). This level may attract selling by the bears.

Shiba Inu price analysis
------------------------

The bulls tried to push Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index)) above the 20-day EMA ($0.000024) on April 30, but the bears held their ground.

![Image 11](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/c198c8b2-10e8-4687-91a4-6f30c1c006d0.png)

_SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AshibUSDT)

The SHIB/USDT pair could slide to $0.000020, which is likely to act as a strong support. Any rebound off this level is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.000018 increases.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. Such a move will signal solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.000033, where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/interpol-extradition-paperwork-binance-executive/

Markdown Content:
The Nigerian Central Bureau of Interpol has finalized the extradition papers of Nadeem Anjarwalla, a [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/) Holdings official currently having legal problems. Anjarwalla left Nigeria after [being accused o](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nigeria-holds-binance-execs-eyes-march-20-hearing/)f money laundering and tax evasion and is now believed to be in Kenya. Garba Umar, head of the Nigerian NCB, also pointed out that attempts are already being made to serve a Red Notice to bring Anjarwalla back to Nigeria for trial.

In an appearance on the local ‚ÄúSunrise Daily‚Äù on April 30, Umar divulged that Anjarwalla‚Äôs precise location is not known, but his last known location was Kenya. Interpol is coordinating with various countries Anjarwalla may have traveled through to gather essential information, which remains confidential.

Incident Details and Binance Exiting Nigeria
--------------------------------------------

Despite Nigerian officials confiscating Anjarwalla‚Äôs travel documents, he left Nigeria on March 22, raising questions about the control of his departure. At the same time, Tigran Gambaryan, Anjarwalla‚Äôs colleague, [was arrested](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nigerian-court-delays-binance-executive-bail/) on similar charges. He pleaded not guilty and is detained for his bail hearing scheduled for May 17. Gambaryan‚Äôs case led to a petition for his release, which has gained over 4,000 signatures.

Subsequent to this, Binance declared its withdrawal from the Nigerian market after the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria accused Binance of involvement in illegal transactions. In consequence, Binance stopped all transactions in the Nigerian naira and delisted all naira trading pairs from its peer-to-peer trading platform in late February. This move signals a major withdrawal from one of Africa‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency markets.

Litigations and Regulatory Measures
-----------------------------------

The charges against Anjarwalla have triggered a united international effort to arrest and repatriate him to Nigeria. The ongoing case is an indication of Interpol‚Äôs growing role in solving transnational financial crimes. This event is a component of overall enforcement measures aimed at compliance and regulatory adherence in the sphere of cryptocurrency.

Blockchain development firm Movement Labs has received an undisclosed investment from Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This investment comes on the heels of Movement Labs' $38 million Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.

Movement Labs is on a mission to build an ecosystem of blockchains based on the modular programming language Move, starting with ‚ÄúM2‚Äù, a Move Virtual Machine Layer 2 for Ethereum. The company plans to use the funds to expand into the Asia-Pacific region and encourage adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems.

‚ÄúBinance Labs' support and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to implement our 'Move Anywhere' strategy, focusing on the vibrant and innovative APAC market,‚Äù said Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs.

Movement's Layer 2 blockchain aims to expand the use of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed by a team within Meta, formerly known as Facebook's now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.

Additionally, Movement Labs is developing Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The company will launch its public testnet Parthenon in the coming weeks and aims for a mainnet launch by the end of the year.

The Web3 landscape is experiencing a significant shift, with user expectations for their [wallets evolving rapidly](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29175135/eu-tightens-noose-around-russia-bans-all-crypto-wallet-services).

Gone are the days when secure asset storage was the sole function; users now seek a more comprehensive and integrated experience within their Web3 wallets.

Features like DApp browsing, trading, NFT marketplaces, and even inscriptions tools are becoming increasingly in-demand.

In an interview with Benzinga, **Alvin Kan**, COO of **Bitget Wallet**, revealed substantial shifts in user expectations for Web3 wallets over the past two years, reflecting broader trends within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors.

Kan noted that the functionality of these wallets has expanded significantly, transforming from mere storage solutions to comprehensive platforms supporting various Web3 activities.

‚ÄúPreviously, Web3 wallets were mainly seen as secure storage for assets. Now, they have evolved into complex gateways offering trading, DApp browsing, and more,‚Äù Kan explained.

He further emphasized that Bitget Wallet has been at the forefront of this evolution since 2018, continuously enhancing its features to meet the growing demand for integrated services like NFT marketplaces and staking gateways.

Kan also highlighted the rise of inscriptions and meme coins as prominent trends driving recent developments in the wallet space.

‚ÄúInscriptions have gained traction, especially post-BTC halving and with the proliferation of ETFs. We‚Äôve responded by enhancing BTC network support and even launched our own meme coin, MOEW, which has seen surprising interest from our users,‚Äù he said.

Addressing future expectations, Kan predicted that AI and intent-based management would play significant roles in the evolution of wallet technology.

‚ÄúMoving forward, integrating AI to improve the wallet experience isn't just about adding features‚Äîit's about fundamentally enhancing how users interact with Web3 technologies,‚Äù he stated.

Kan also discussed the importance of security, a top concern for many users, especially following several high-profile breaches.

‚ÄúSecurity isn't just an add-on; it‚Äôs integral to the user experience. At Bitget, we‚Äôve introduced keyless MPC wallets and have established strong partnerships for security audits, ensuring our users‚Äô assets are protected without complicating the user experience,‚Äù he asserted.

Bitget‚Äôs approach to integrating with various blockchain mainnets illustrates their strategic focus on interoperability and user engagement.

‚ÄúOur recent BWB Points campaign, for instance, allowed users to engage with over 40 different projects, earning points that could be converted into our upcoming BWB token,‚Äù Kan said, underlining the potential for such strategies to foster a more interconnected and user-friendly Web3 environment.

As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Benzinga‚Äôs upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19 will further explore these developments.

Insights from leaders like Kan will be central to discussions on how the industry can navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the [next generation of digital asset technologies.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38547115/ex-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sees-crypto-industry-entering-new-phase)

**Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) advantages of multi-signature wallets over hardware wallets.**

Buterin highlighted crucial considerations for crypto holders worldwide to keep their assets secure.

Multi-Signature Wallets Over Hardware Wallets
---------------------------------------------

Buterin [stressed](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) the significance of employing multi-signature wallets to safeguard personal funds. He revealed that he utilizes this method for over 90% of his assets.¬†

With [multi-signature wallets](https://beincrypto.com/learn/metamask-vs-coinbase/), the control over funds is distributed among multiple parties, known as ‚Äúkeys.‚Äù Therefore, Buterin advocates for an M-of-N approach. This¬†entails the user holding some keys while the remainder is entrusted to other individuals, forming a decentralized security network.¬†

Buterin also advised against disclosing the identities of these trusted parties to each other to ensure an added layer of privacy and security.

This reflects the importance of user vigilance and responsible storage practices, as even the most secure hardware wallets are susceptible to user-related vulnerabilities.

Buterin and Watts‚Äô endorsement of multi-signature wallets aligns with the broader industry consensus on enhancing security protocols. Indeed, prioritizing robust security measures is fundamental to risk mitigation and asset protection.

**April 2024 witnessed a remarkable 141% reduction in financial damages due to crypto-related [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) exploits, with losses totaling a historic low of $25.7 million.**¬†

This figure represents the smallest amount recorded since 2021, suggesting a significant improvement in Crypto security measures.

Crypto Security Exploits Drop, Indicating Enhanced Its Safety
-------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto security firm CertiK [highlighted](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1785262226430926997) that the sharp decrease in damages was primarily due to fewer exploits targeting blockchain protocols. The bulk of the April losses, amounting to $21 million, arose from [DeFi](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/) platform attacks.

The repeated breach of FixedFloat‚Äôs Ethereum-based hot [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/) resulted in a $2.8 million loss. The same group was responsible for a February attack, which cost the exchange $26 million, perpetrated this incident.

&gt; ‚ÄúCombining all the incidents in April,¬†we‚Äôve¬†confirmed ~$ $25.7 m lost to exploits, hacks, and [scams](https://beincrypto.com/learn/common-cryptocurrency-scams/). This is the lowest figure¬†we‚Äôve¬†recorded, dating back to 2021, and it is a 141% decrease from March,‚Äù¬†CertiK said.¬†

Additionally, exit scams accounted for $4.3 million in losses. These frauds, where founders absconded with invested funds, included notable incidents like the suspected [rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino](https://beincrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-zero-knowledge-misuse/). This is under investigation for potentially diverting $32 million in Ethereum.

Security Score of ZKasino Source: [CertiK](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/zkasino)

Only three major incidents in April exceeded the $1 million threshold, reflecting a strengthening in [protocol security.](https://beincrypto.com/blockchain-security-slowmist-new-crypto-scam/) Among these, the [tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-tokenization/) platform Grandbase suffered a $2 million theft due to a compromised private key, which led to unauthorized token minting and subsequent robbery.

CertiK‚Äôs analysis points to an encouraging trend of resilience within the [cryptocurrency industry despite ongoing challenges](https://beincrypto.com/us-recovers-millions-crypto-fraudsters/). The reduction in private key compromises and the lower frequency of high-value breaches suggest that enhanced security practices are becoming more effective.

Fewer key compromises and exit scams are pointed as the reasons behind the record fall.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto protocols witnessed $25.7 million in losses across three major incidents in April, reaching a record low since 2021. Blockchain security firm CertiK highlights that this is a 141% decrease from March‚Äôs figures.

The reduction in losses is due to the fall in private key compromise incidents, which plummeted from eleven in March to just three in April, CertiK underscored.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The largest exploit in April involved FixedFloat, with suspicious withdrawals totaling approximately $3 million across multiple chains. FixedFloat acknowledged this as their second exploit by the same attackers since February.

Meanwhile, exit scams also saw a downturn, with the most notable being CondomSol‚Äôs pre-sale scam on the Solana network, leading to losses of around $933,000. In total, April experienced 13 exit scams, a 40% reduction from the previous month.

![Image 2: Crypto losses caused by exploits fall 141% in April: CertiK](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20571%20887'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Flash loan attacks in April resulted in the lowest monthly losses since February 2022, with four incidents totaling $129,086. The largest of these accounted for $55,000. Combining all incidents, April‚Äôs losses amounted to approximately $25.7 million, the lowest on record since 2021.

However, the brief CertiK report on April losses does not account for the ZKasino controversy. ZKasino‚Äôs co-founders allegedly performed an exit scam on April 25, by swapping nearly $33 million worth of Ether (ETH) for their native token ZKAS. The funds were locked on the gambling platform bridge, as users tried to be eligible for ZKAS airdrop.

Markdown Content:
United States Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has stated that she is "deeply troubled" by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) stance on non-custodial software.

In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367), Lummis expressed concern at the DOJ's "hyper-aggressive argument that non-custodial software can constitute a money transmission service." She added that the DOJ's stance "contradicts existing Treasury guidance," and "violates the rule of law."

"Arguments against self-custody software threaten the fundamental property rights that are core to being an American," Lummis said, adding that she will fight "for your rights to hold your own keys and run your own node." She further accused the Biden Administration of "criminalizing core tenants of the [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) network and [decentralized finance](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance)."

Lummis' comments follow two recent cases where DOJ prosecutors have pushed for criminal charges against software developers for unlicensed money transmission: an unsealed indictment against Bitcoin mixer [Samourai Wallet](https://decrypt.co/227949/feds-arrest-founders-bitcoin-mixer-samourai-wallet), and a [reply brief](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf) responding to the defense's motion to dismiss in the [case](https://decrypt.co/news-explorer?pinned=277556&amp;title=tornado-cash-co-founder-roman-storm-arrested-for-money-laundering) against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.

&gt; I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing¬†core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.
&gt; 
&gt; My full statement. ‚¨áÔ∏è [pic.twitter.com/M3CHcNTi3x](https://t.co/M3CHcNTi3x)
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äî Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The DOJ's interpretation of money transmission laws, encompassing wallet developers who have no direct control over user assets, has sparked a backlash among the crypto community.

Crypto advocacy group [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org/dojs-new-stance-on-crypto-wallets-is-a-threat-to-liberty-and-the-rule-of-law/) has characterized the DOJ's stance as "a massive overreach," arguing that it contradicts [existing FinCEN guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf) and [rulings](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/administrative-rulings/application-fincens-regulations-virtual).

In a blog post, Coin Center's director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh claimed the DOJ's position would mean that "every functioning cryptocurrency wallet and smart contract is 'doing' money transmission and every developer is engaged in unlicensed money transmission."

The group has filed an [amicus brief](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-files-a-court-brief-in-defense-of-tornado-cash-developer/) in defense of Roman Storm, arguing that the publication of Tornado Cash's code is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.

Markdown Content:
As the [cryptocurrency landscape](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) undergoes a volatile shift, [Standard Chartered](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/), a global banking behemoth, has voiced concerns about ¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) price trajectory, suggesting it might drop to the $50,000 mark.

_Geoffrey Kendrick_, head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at [Standard Chartered,](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/) has voiced concerns after Bitcoin‚Äôs recent dip below $60,000, indicating a potential drop toward $50,000-$52,000, according to [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/bitcoin-could-drop-further-to-as-low-as-50k-standard-chartered-says/).

Adding to the [crypto](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) market‚Äôs challenges are the significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin [ETF](https://finbold.com/etfs/)s and tepid interest in Hong Kong‚Äôs newly launched [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://finbold.com/guide/what-is-bitcoin-etf/), the factors Kendrick cites as primary reasons for the recent downturn.

### Picks for you

Key factors include five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and prices falling below the ETFs‚Äô average purchase price. Furthermore, the average purchase price of these ETFs falling below $58,000 increases the risk of liquidation, especially since more than half of these ETF positions are incurring losses.

Additionally, the bank pointed out that the launch of the Hong Kong spot ETF did not meet expectations, with the focus on the low turnover volume of $11 million overshadowing the satisfactory net asset position of the new ETFs.

The broader economic environment hasn‚Äôt been supportive either, with tightening liquidity measures in the U.S. which have been worsening since mid-April, exerting additional pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.

Long-term optimism despite current volatility
---------------------------------------------

Despite these immediate challenges, Standard Chartered remains [bullish](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) on Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects. The bank recently revised its [end-of-2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-to-hit-150000-after-halving.html) Bitcoin price prediction upward from $100,000 to $150,000.

The bank recommends purchasing Bitcoin if it falls to the $50,000-$52,000 range, or if the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th, which measures inflation, is favorable.

While the market currently faces downward pressure, the underlying momentum and institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin might rebound strongly. This belief is anchored in the crypto‚Äôs past performance and its foundational role in the digital asset space, pointing towards recovery as market conditions improve and as strategic investments in the ecosystem continue to unfold.

A prospective stablecoin bill will likely not be included in upcoming must-pass Federal Aviation Administration legislation as lawmakers try to get the bill across the finish line. House and Senate leadership have indicated the FAA will be "clean" of bills lawmakers have been looking to attach, so it is unlikely that a stablecoin bill will be included, according to a Democratic aide. Lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., ranking Democrat Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had reportedly discussed attaching the bill to upcoming FAA reauthorization, which could accompany cannabis legislation. That must-pass reauthorization is up against a May 10 deadline.
