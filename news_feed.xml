URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/vitalik-buterin-zk-proofs-more-efficient

Markdown Content:
Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a new blog post discussing a new cryptographic proving system that can make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient.

The proving system, called Binius, is designed to operate directly over binary code on computers. Binary code is a language understood by computers, and it is used to store information and represents data using the symbols zero and one, otherwise known as bits. 

Although there are some similarities between STARKs and Binius, Buterin explains that the mathematical tricks that enable these different proving systems are very different. 

Generally speaking, STARKs is a technology that has enabled complicated statements to be easily cryptographically verified. It is designed in a way that can easily compute numbers when they are of small value, when there are large values, STARKs generate extra values, which can lead to inefficiency. 

Unlike STARKs that “arithmetize” a statement into a polynomial equation — a mathematical expression which model a relationship between variables in a block — Binius treats data as a hypercube and grid, and uses multilinear polynomials to perform cryptographic proofs.

Binius converts individual values into bits and places them in a hypercube and a square. This hypercube is then converted into a grid and computations are performed in order to receive an output matrix.

A verifier will then perform its own computational calculations to ensure that the information itself matches and ensure that the compute columns returns a value claimed by the prover.

“I highly encourage people to understand and explore! Lots of innovations have been happening in ZK-proving recently. And I expect lots more to come soon,” Buterin wrote in an [X post](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1784912152655974533).

According to a recent [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/business/a-strong-us-dollar-weighs-on-the-world.html) by Joe Rennison and Karl Russell for The New York Times (NYT), the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength against nearly every major currency in the world this year. The Times reports that two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, largely due to expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

The article explains that high Fed rates, a response to persistent inflation, have made American assets more attractive to investors worldwide. As a result, money has been flowing into the United States, creating ripple effects felt by policymakers, politicians, and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo.

The Times highlights the far-reaching consequences of a strong dollar, including intensified inflation abroad, higher interest bills for countries that have borrowed in dollars, and potential benefits for foreign businesses exporting to the U.S. However, the article also notes that American companies selling abroad may be put at a disadvantage, potentially widening the U.S. trade deficit.

The impact of the dollar’s strength, as reported by The New York Times, depends on the underlying reasons for high U.S. interest rates. If rates remain elevated due to stubborn inflation despite slowing economic growth, policymakers worldwide may face a difficult choice between supporting their domestic economies or bolstering their currencies.

The article emphasizes that Asia has been particularly affected by the strong dollar, with the Japanese yen and Korean won reaching multi-year lows. The Times also points out that China has allowed the yuan to weaken, raising questions about the strength of its economy.

Per the NYT article, European policymakers are considering cutting rates but must be mindful of the potential impact on the euro’s value relative to the dollar. The article also notes that central banks in South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia are grappling with similar challenges.

URL Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-signs-hint-that-bitcoin-price-is-nearing-a-bottom

Published Time: 2024-05-01T19:45:46.000Z

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin price crashed between April 30 and May 1, with its price decreasing by 11.5% to $56,522. This downturn triggered $172 million in leveraged long position liquidations, which is notably low given that Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) futures open interest was at $28.9 billion before the price crash. Consequently, it would be simplistic to assume that bulls were taken by surprise.

Uncertainty should drop after the Fed minutes publish
-----------------------------------------------------

Some analysts believe that investors are in a holding pattern until Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, concludes his speech following the two-day monetary council meeting on May 1. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will maintain interest rates at 5.25%, there is considerable skepticism regarding the U.S. Treasury Department’s ability to finance the government’s budget.

On April 30, the yield on the U.S. Treasury two-year note climbed to its highest level in five months, reaching 5.06%, as investors sought higher returns to offset increased risk following the announcement of a $1.07 trillion deficit for the first half of 2024. Since the Fed’s rate hikes throughout 2023, interest expenses on the deficit have risen by 23% in the first half of 2024 and are projected to continue to rise as long as rates remain elevated.

Bitcoin is not alone in facing declines: Worsening macroeconomic conditions have made investors more risk-averse. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks mid- and small-cap U.S.-listed companies, fell by 8.2% over the last 30 days, wiping out gains from the previous two months. Similarly, WTI oil prices have dropped 8.3% since April 5, when they reached a five-month peak of $87.91.

A key indication that Bitcoin’s price correction may be reaching a bottom stems from the traditional markets, following a series of robust first-quarter corporate earnings reports from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, TSMC, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays. A temporary recovery in the stock market shifts investor focus away from Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, although traders may seek alternatives if the Fed decides to maintain higher rates for an extended period.

Bitcoin miner capitulation FUD and strong crypto influx in China
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin miners are under significant strain after the April 20 halving, which reduced their rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC per block. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, mentioned that estimates of miners’ outflows to exchanges show [no signs of capitulation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-signs-bitcoin-miner-capitulation-despite-plummeting-revenue-cryptoquant) “for now.” Young Ju added that if the Bitcoin price downtrend “stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of Bitcoin.”

Thus, another sign that Bitcoin’s downturn may be nearing its end is the steadfastness of miners, which remain reluctant to sell despite a 57% drop in the Hashrate Index, as [reported](https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index) by Luxor Technology. This metric assesses the daily expected return of one terahash of hashing power, factoring in network difficulty, Bitcoin’s price and transaction fees.

To understand the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, examining the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)), can be enlightening. The premium on USDC transactions over the official U.S. dollar rate offers insight into retail investors’ activities, indicating whether they are moving into or out of cryptocurrency markets.

On May 1, the premium for USDC in China increased to 2.7%, signifying a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. This sustained interest points to a positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in China, bolstering an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, which recently saw a 20% decline in price over three weeks.

However, despite potential improvements in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s notes and the realization that fears of miner capitulation are, thus far, unfounded, the situation in U.S. markets shows a different trend. Specifically, net outflows from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million in the past five trading days.

Such findings suggest that investment flows are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price movements, with no certainty that the $56,500 support level will hold.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/developer-awarded-250k-by-curve-finance/

Markdown Content:
Cryptocurrency and [DeFi](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/) protocols have faced increasing problems due to vulnerabilities and resultant loss of funds. As the problems have continued, those identifying it have contributed to the benefit of the cause of decentralized finance. In a big discovery, a cybersecurity expert identified a vulnerability in Curve Finance protocol which could be used for withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

Cryptocurrency protocols and vulnerability 
-------------------------------------------

There has been an estimate of losses [amounting to $758 million](https://de.fi/blog/de-fi-rekt-report-over-758m-lost-in-q3-2023) due to vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols in Q3 of 2023. There have been a staggering 116 cases which show that there is an urgent need for enhancement of security. A workforce needs to be deployed for this purpose to identify vulnerabilities and address problems. 

In a recent discovery, Curve Finance protocol has identified a vulnerability in the DeFi system. The vulnerability is of historical importance as it has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for years. The vulnerability has resulted in hackers’ access to the protocol’s liquidity pool and drawing out funds. 

There have been a range of security attacks in 2023 and major areas of focus for hackers included smart contract vulnerabilities, reentry attacks, and Oracle manipulation attacks. The first one is of critical importance because if a hacker is able to identify a vulnerability, they can use it for negative purposes, affecting the funds and security of the protocol.  

Claim of a key vulnerability in [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/) and other protocols came from a cybersecurity expert Marc Croc. Belonging to Kupia security, Marc Croc said that the vulnerability resulted in the loss of funds from the liquidity pool. The mentioned cybersecurity expert also added that it has led to the loss of millions from various protocols. 

Reentrancy Vulnerability in Curve Finance
-----------------------------------------

Reenetracy vulnerability was verified by the developers’ team from [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/). In a detailed overview, they were able to identify and confirm it. According to official sources, the bug could manipulate the balances of a DeFi protocol. The manipulation of balances could also result in the withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

&gt; Big thanks for the disclosure! Grieving attacks are not as dangerous (funds would be anyway recoverable, and no profit for attacker) – could have caused serious panic if happened.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an example of a very professional work
&gt; 
&gt; — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1785406648082997532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

According to Curve Protocol sources, the bug didn’t pose an existential threat but it could create panic if any such incident took place. Furthermore, the company believed that they could recover funds in case such an incident took place. In July Curve Finance was able to recover funds amounting to $62 million which had been stolen after a vulnerability was exposed to hackers. 

Furthermore, the protocol members agreed to return assets valuing $49.2 million to liquidity providers. It announced the recovery of ETH assets, CRV, and other assets that were recovered by whitehat hackers. 

Curve protocol has brought forward a proposal the community fund will supply CRV tokens. The attackers identified a vulnerability in the Vyper language where problems were found in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0.

Developer rewarded $250K
------------------------

It was a critical problem that would have created problems for the development team because of the increased panic amongst the users and investors. To face the problem promptly, a cybersecurity expert identified the problem, not revealing their identity. 

&gt; 🐞I reported a vulnerability in [@CurveFinance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and I am thrilled to share that I've been awarded a bug bounty of $250,000. 🧵
&gt; 
&gt; — Marco Croc (@malicator) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Once the problem was confirmed, the protocol awarded the whitehat maximum bug bounty of $250K. The whitehat shared the details in the X thread, thanking Curve Finance. Furthermore, the account shared the details of how the vulnerability would affect the protocol. 

Conclusion
----------

In a recent tweet from a whitehat cybersecurity expert, Marc Croc announced the discovery of a vulnerability in Curve Finance. The development team confirmed and addressed the problem, announcing a bounty amount of $250K for the mentioned whitehat. Though the problem wasn’t an existential threat, it would have created a panic.

Markdown Content:
Just a few months ago, most economists expected the Federal Reserve to kick start rate cuts by May. All signs pointed to this: the fight against inflation appeared to be coming to an end, jobs data promised a cooling labor market on the horizon, and consumer confidence began to falter. 

Fast forward to May’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and the hopes of a rate cut in the first half of 2024 are quickly diminishing. Indeed, it appears likely the Fed will hold rates where they are for much longer than anyone could have imagined back in January. Some market commentators even think we're stuck with “higher for longer” until 2025, despite the pressure of an imminent presidential election.

Whether rates stay put until September or next January, the May FOMC meeting was certainly a far cry from December 2023, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell first mentioned rate cuts, sending markets into a frenzy. Now, we're seeing a much more hawkish committee, resolute in its restrictive monetary policy stance in the face of stubborn inflation and a labor market that refuses to stumble.

**_Related:_** [**_The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halving_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/runes-protocol-ignite-new-season-bitcoin-after-halving)

But while disappointing for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, the Fed's stance shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who follows economic data. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — [the PCE index](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-trades-deep-discount-after-halving-5-things-bitcoin-this-week) — rose to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in February. The CPI index has remained similarly sticky, rising again from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March.

This has been fuelled by rampant spending, with consumers preferring to take on more debt rather than tighten their belts. In fact, the savings rate in the U.S. has continuously declined from 4.1% in January to just 3.2% in March, while household debt levels keep beating previous records. On top of this, unemployment has failed to edge higher. The jobless rate fell from 3.9% in February to 3.8% in March, hovering around historic lows.

So, even though the economy is beginning to slow — first-quarter GDP growth surprised on the downside, coming in at 1.6% against expectations of 2.4% - we're still a long way from the economic slowdown that would warrant stimulus in the form of rate cuts. Indeed, Powell has always been clear that the Fed's monetary policy decisions will be driven by data, and data alone. And the data simply doesn't support a looser stance, yet.

As expected, the markets have been taking this disappointment badly. Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) was hovered between $60,000 and $65,000 in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting, and global stock markets were subdued as expectations of a hawkish pivot mounted. Conversely, the dollar strengthened, battering other global currencies like the yen, which fell to the lowest level against the dollar since 1990. Other emerging market currencies can be expected to follow.

![Image 2: a black screen with the words'powerful unlucky that move will be like'](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/4a6465be-0133-4667-ae94-0efaf1e0091d.jpg)

_Jerome Powell said it was "unlikely" the Fed's next move would be a rate hike. Source: X_

And the bad news is that we're likely stuck with this picture for a good few months. This will be a real anticlimax for those who expected the Bitcoin halving to drive a bullish breakout to a new all-time high. After some rampant price action over recent months, no one is ready for another extended period of sideways trading. It’s akin to the lights going on at the nightclub when the party is just getting started.

**_Related:_** [**_Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchains_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-illustrates-dark-side-monolithic-blockchains)

As long as the Fed holds rates steady, though, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a tight range — below $70,000 — barring any major global disasters causing a flight to safety. So far this year, Bitcoin hasn’t really cared about macroeconomics — it shrugged off the last few inflation announcements. But the Fed’s stance will have a more profound effect. The reality is that BTC is now deeply embedded in traditional financial markets thanks to spot ETFs, so it will most likely mimic the behavior of other risk assets until rates begin coming down.

So, thanks to Jerome Powell, we’re in for a boring summer that will truly test investors’ patience. That's not to say there won't be another Bitcoin party — it's coming, and it will likely rival or perhaps even surpass what we've already seen this year. Over the longer term, the Bitcoin investment thesis remains intact. Indeed, while Powell's renewed hawkishness is buoying the U.S. dollar for now, it's only a matter of time until the Fed finally pulls the plug, causing renewed dollar weakness.

Once the greenback begins its slide, Bitcoin will provide refuge from currency devaluation. Then, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs will truly come into their own, and those who can hold on to their assets and wait out the drought will be rewarded. Until then, perhaps it's not such a bad idea to leave investment portfolios alone and go enjoy the summer.

*   **Tether reports a Q1 net profit of $4.52 billion.**
*   **Gains come from treasury holdings and Bitcoin and Gold.**
*   **Treasuries enable Tether to make substantial profits.** 

Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of [USDT](https://dailycoin.com/stablecoins/tether-usdt/), the biggest stablecoin in the world, had often [found itself in controversy](https://dailycoin.com/tether-usdt-a-giant-with-feet-of-clay/). These largely stemmed from the transparency of its reserves, which often came under question. 

Since then, Tether has started to take transparency more seriously. Its latest report breaks down the company’s assets, including its significant profits. 

On Wednesday, May 1, Tether Holdings Limited released its [financial report](https://t.co/K7eFBQ6aAQ) for the first quarter of 2024, showing a record net profit of $4.52 billion. According to the attestation by the accounting firm BDO, the largest share, $1 billion, came from US Treasuries. 

The remainder came from the increase in the value of Bitcoin and gold, which Tether owns in large quantities. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price was $42,280 and has since shot up significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $57,329. Moreover, gold has significantly increased over the same period, going from $2070 per ounce to $2300. 

![Image 4: A chart breaking down Tether's reserves.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20945'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Tether’s considerable Bitcoin and gold holdings contributed substantially to its profits. According to the attestation, Tether’s total reserves are $115.41 billion, with the largest portion, $90.87 billion, in U.S. Treasuries. 

Why Tether Holds So Much Bonds
------------------------------

Tether’s bonds offer a liquid asset that is easily convertible to cash, enabling the company to meet eventual withdrawal demands. However, unlike cash reserves, US Treasury bonds provide a return on investment. This means Tether can profitably from them while exposing itself to relatively little risk.  

In addition to bonds, Tether holds $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents. These are highly liquid assets that fulfill immediate redemption requirements. 

In addition to treasury bonds and cash, Tether also holds $5.37 billion in Bitcoin and $3.65 billion in Gold. Notably, Tether issues a gold-backed stablecoin, which explains its substantial gold holdings. 

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **Despite Tether’s reports,** [**questions**](https://dailycoin.com/tethers-usdt-approaches-historic-ath-market-cap-milestone/) **about its reserve transparency still persist among the crypto community.** 
*   **Tether has recently been expanding** [**beyond stablecoins**](https://dailycoin.com/whats-behind-tethers-expansive-vision-beyond-stablecoins/)**, including into venture capital, big data, and AI.** 

Why This Matters
----------------

Tether’s recent financial outcomes and the management of its reserves have broad implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting perceptions of USDT’s stability and reliability.

Markdown Content:
According to a [report](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-nyc-hush-money-trial-resume-with-bankers-testimony-2024-04-30/) by Reuters, Judge Juan Merchan has fined former U.S. President Donald Trump $9,000 for contempt of court during his ongoing criminal hush money trial, warning that incarceration could follow if Trump continues to breach the gag order. The fine, issued on Tuesday, was for Trump’s violation of the gag order, which restricts him from making public comments about trial witnesses and participants. Trump was penalized $1,000 for each of nine comments he made online that the judge found in violation of this order.

Justice Merchan, overseeing the trial, expressed concerns that the fine might not sufficiently deter Trump, given his substantial wealth, and noted his own limitations in imposing a higher penalty. The judge emphasized the necessity of upholding the integrity of the court’s orders and indicated a willingness to consider jail as a further measure if Trump persists in his violations.

The cited comments included an article shared by Trump labeling his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness in the trial, as a “serial liar.” Another contentious post cited a claim about “undercover liberal activists” attempting to infiltrate the jury. Merchan dismissed Trump’s defense that he should not be held accountable for content he reposted but did not originally write.

A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Thursday, where additional penalties for other statements may be discussed. Merchan also demanded the removal of the offending posts from Trump’s Truth Social platform and his campaign website.

In a response on Truth Social, Trump decried the actions as an infringement on his free speech and denounced the trial as “rigged.” His attorney, Todd Blanche, argued the posts were legitimate responses to political attacks, yet failed to provide evidence of any provocation by the witnesses involved.

The developments occur amid Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting his charges of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment meant to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter. Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty.

According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/arts/television/late-night-trump-contempt.html) by The New York Times (NYT), the $9,000 gag order violation fine prompted late-night comedians to seize the opportunity for some lighthearted jabs at Trump’s expense.

Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” playfully questioned the significance of the $9,000 fine for a successful businessman like Trump:

“I know $9,000 might not seem like a lot to a successful businessman, but what about to Trump?”

However, he quickly followed up with a more serious note, mentioning that the judge lamented the legal limit on the fine and warned that if Trump continues to violate the gag order, jail time may become a necessary punishment. Colbert quipped, “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump, but I need it.”

On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the host took a different approach, arguing that the situation seemed unfair to Trump. Kimmel pointed out the irony of the trial being about Trump paying a woman to be quiet, only to now face fines for not being quiet himself. He jokingly compared the situation to Jesus, a carpenter, being nailed to a cross, and urged his audience to “think about it” and “read about it in your Trump-brand Bibles.”

Kimmel also poked fun at the judge’s warning that continued gag order violations could result in Trump being locked up. He imagined Trump’s wife, Melania, encouraging her husband not to let the judge dictate his actions.

The comedians didn’t stop there. Kimmel took a jab at Trump’s spending habits, suggesting that the former president could easily spend $9,000 at a Wendy’s drive-through. Jimmy Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show,” joined in, imagining Trump’s response to the fine: “But I get the 10th one free, right?”

Decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider Ankr will [introduce](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-x-talus-delivering-btc-liquidity-to-onchain-ai-and-smart-agents/?page=1) Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) liquid staking tokens to AI-focused blockchain Talus starting May 1. 

“Bitcoin is not only the oldest blockchain but also continues to have the highest liquidity,” Ankr wrote. “Unfortunately, this liquidity has traditionally been trapped within the Bitcoin L1. With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols. This enables users on the Bitcoin network to earn additional staking rewards while providing other ecosystems access to Bitcoin liquidity.”

To engage in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), users first delegate their BTC to an operator in a restaking protocol, which is then used as collateral for Ankr to create BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In the case of Talus, the Bitcoin LSTs can be used to power the blockchain’s smart agents or AI assistants and their applications, such as “booking travel, making purchases online, and managing portfolios.”

Smart agents on Talus are also capable of bundling multilayer atomic swaps and executing them in one single transaction to provide security exploits such as flash loan attacks. “Ankr’s BTC liquid staking unlocks a massive amount of liquidity to ensure that smart agents on Talus can execute simultaneous DeFi transactions like atomic swaps seamlessly,” Talus commented. 

The move comes after Ankr [revealed](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-btc-liquid-staking-everything-you-need-to-know/) its first Bitcoin liquid staking product in early March in conjunction with the Babylon protocol. The project allows users to “earn yields from their idle bitcoins in a secure way” by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral to mint LSTs that can be used to validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains. 

Yields earned from the staked LSTs are then funneled back to users’ locked Bitcoin. Currently, the Babylon protocol is in its testnet phase, with a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year. 

Despite an ongoing market correction, the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem has been thriving over the past year with the invention of new protocols such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Atomicals and Runes.

One such project, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, has [accumulated a total value locked of $700 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-defi-ecosystem-thrives-market) from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin and BNB Smart Chain. In a statement to Cointelegraph, SolvBTC claimed that the protocol recently surpassed 10,000 BTC staked and attracted “over 92,000 participants” shortly after its launch earlier this month.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its dog-themed branding, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in whale activity, indicating significant movements of large SHIB tokens. This surge comes after SHIB’s price decline of over 10% over the last seven days.

Whale activity, often a key indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, saw a staggering 268% increase in the case of Shiba Inu. [Large transaction volume](https://zycrypto.com/0-0001-shib-price-tsunami-looks-near-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-massive-transaction-spike/), typically involving transactions worth more than $100,000, surged to $98.12 million within 24 hours.

This surge highlights a significant uptick in whale activity, suggesting that large holders of SHIB tokens are actively buying or selling.

**Dramatic Increase in SHIB Large Transactions**
------------------------------------------------

According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions in Shiba Inu saw a dramatic increase from 1.07 trillion SHIB on April 28 to 4.17 trillion SHIB on April 29. This substantial spike in large transactions indicates that whales in the SHIB market have been particularly active, possibly taking advantage of the price dip.

SHIB has still been down by 12.05% over the past seven days. This divergence between whale activity and price performance suggests a complex interplay of factors driving SHIB’s market dynamics.

**Shiba Inu Ecosystem Key Developments**
----------------------------------------

In other [developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem](https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-beckons-as-shib-devs-aim-to-go-big-with-upcoming-shibarium-update/), the Shiba Eternity collectible card game (CCG) has undergone significant upgrades. The latest version, 1.2.7, introduces enhancements to improve player interaction and strategic depth.

Notable changes include improvements to the social menu, making players connect easier, and adjustments to fighter mechanics, providing a more balanced gameplay experience. Specifically, these fighters have been tweaked to no longer inflict debuff damage on adjacent friendly fighters upon being destroyed.

ShibaSwap, the project’s decentralized exchange (DEX), is expanding to support Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. This move enhances security and interoperability, offering users a seamless trading experience.

Adding to Shiba Inu’s excitement, the SHIB/JPY trading pair has been listed on Binance Japan. This listing opens up new trading opportunities for SHIB holders, further expanding the coin’s reach and accessibility in the Japanese market.

In conclusion, Shiba Inu’s recent surge in whale activity and ecosystem developments paint a dynamic picture of the coin’s evolving market landscape.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting by keeping interest rates unchanged, maintaining the target range at 5.25% to 5.5%. This decision was widely anticipated by market participants and came as a relief to investors, who had been closely monitoring the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.

According to a [report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/fed-meeting-today-live-updates-on-may-fed-rate-decision.html) by CNBC, during the post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided insights into the Fed’s decision-making process and its outlook for the future. Powell emphasized that the central bank’s rate decisions are not influenced by political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He stressed the importance of focusing on getting the economics right and stated that considering political factors would reduce the likelihood of achieving that goal.

Powell also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction process, known as quantitative tightening (QT). He clarified that the decision to slow the pace of reducing the balance sheet is not intended to provide accommodation to the economy or be less restrictive. Instead, the move aims to ensure a smooth process and avoid financial market turmoil, drawing lessons from the previous instance of balance sheet reduction.

When asked about the possibility of the U.S. entering a period of “stagflation,” characterized by slowing economic growth and persistent inflation, Powell downplayed these concerns. He pointed out that, by some measures, economic growth is at 3%, and inflation is below 3%, suggesting that the current economic environment does not fit the definition of stagflation.

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Powell’s remarks was his indication that it is unlikely the next policy move will be a rate hike. This statement prompted a rally in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all initially experiencing sharp gains. Powell’s comments provided reassurance to investors who had been anticipating a potential pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle.

Powell also acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has not yet gained “greater confidence” in the trajectory of inflation this year. He stated that the central bank is prepared to maintain the current target federal funds rate for as long as necessary until there is persuasive evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% target.

While the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, the central bank’s cautious tone and willingness to remain patient in the face of uncertain economic conditions have provided some comfort to market participants. As investors digest the implications of the Fed’s latest meeting, attention will now turn to upcoming economic data releases, particularly those related to the labor market and inflation, which will help shape expectations for future monetary policy decisions.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), XRP as well as several other altcoins turned green during a [speech](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1785745563515834870) by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Powell dismissed market concerns about "stagflation," a scenario in which slow economic growth is coupled with high inflation. He said that he did not see "the stag or the flation."

Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon amplified stagflation concerns, warning that the US economy might be heading back to the 1970s. 

In response to Powell's speech, American businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach said that he expects only a single rate cut this year. He doesn't see a rate cut coming this June. The Fed chair himself has stated that it would be hard to predict how the rates are going to change, but he has predicted that the next policy move is unlikely to be a cut. 

[card](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays)According to Powell, rate cuts could come sooner due to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. However, the decision will still hinge on the incoming inflation data. Powell has stressed that the Fed is now satisfied with inflation staying at 3%. The Fed's goal is to bring inflation back to 2% before it would be able to start cutting rates. 

Interest rate futures are [betting](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1785746107055657129) on a single rate cut in 2024. The first rate cut is expected to occur in September. 

The cryptocurrency market has been [hit hard](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays) by the Fed's U-turn, with Bitcoin logging its worst monthly candle since August 2023. The Fed was previously predicted to implement at least three rate cuts this year.

Bitcoin’s price briefly soared to $59,300 following a selloff that dipped it below $56,700 earlier today, according to CoinGecko’s data. The resurgence came after the Federal Reserve (Fed) had decided to maintain interest rates between 525 and 550 basis points.

In a statement announcing the hold, Powell said the decision to hold rates steady was due to high inflation. As he noted, the Fed plans to continue reducing public bond sales, yet the remaining bonds continue to be sold at the same pace.

&gt; “Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace,” stated Powell, “…in recent months inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.”

Powell noted the solid pace of economic expansion, strong job gains, and low unemployment, despite inflation remaining above the desired 2 percent target.

&gt; “Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” he said. “Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.”

According to him, inflation has exceeded expectations in the short term, yet aligns with long-term forecasts. Due to these higher-than-anticipated inflation indicators, the central bank remains hesitant to lower interest rates.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The Fed has indicated that it will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. However, it also noted that it would consider adjusting its policy should there be an increase in unemployment.

Fed Chair: “I don’t see the stag or the flation”
------------------------------------------------

In contrast to the previous belief that Powell could have a hawkish stance, he maintained a neutral stance during his speech today.

Addressing a series of questions from the media about the state of the world’s economic powerhouse, Powell said there is a low likelihood of raising interest rates further, as current data does not support such a move. According to him, the Fed believes that the current high-interest rates are sufficient to guide inflation back toward the 2% target.

Speaking of stagflation risks, he expressed skepticism about the claim that the US has entered a period of stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation coupled with economic decline.

According to Powell, the defining conditions of stagflation won’t last or fully develop because inflation will eventually decrease.

&gt; “I don’t see the ‘stag’ or the ‘-flation’,” Powell [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/fed-meeting-today-live-updates-on-may-fed-rate-decision.html). “I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he added.

Despite Powell’s neutral stance, Bitcoin’s regained momentum faltered. After briefly surpassing $59,000, it couldn’t hold above this key level. CoinGecko data shows Bitcoin is currently trading at around $57,300, a 3.4% drop in one hour.

Similarly, top ten altcoins experienced a modest post-Fed decision rally, with gains between 0.5% and 2.5%. However, this short-lived bounce quickly fizzled out.

**Dogecoin** DOGE/USD and **Shiba Inu** SHIB/USD have experienced a turbulent month, but traders remain optimistic about [their future prospects](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38552945/how-did-shiba-inu-become-the-dogecoin-killer-crypto-whale-thinks-its-mission-and-this-one-).

**What Happened:** Renowned chart analyst **Ali Martinez** has predicted a bullish breakout for Shiba Inu, highlighting the formation of a bull flag on its daily chart. Martinez is placing buy orders around $0.000018343, anticipating a potential surge in Shiba Inu’s value to $0.000072323.

Meanwhile, crypto trader **YG Crypto** [analyzed](https://twitter.com/ygcrypto/status/1785647800686096467) Dogecoin’s recent performance, which saw a dramatic 40% price drop after reaching $0.228.

Despite the sharp decline, Dogecoin is still trading above the crucial support level of $0.112-$0.123, which previously prevented a steeper fall. YG Crypto suggests that this support level could serve as a potential springboard for a rebound.

However, a break below this support could indicate further downward pressure.

**Why It Matters:** IntoTheBlock [data](https://app.intotheblock.com/) shows a 36.2% surge in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume to $1.32 billion, while daily active addresses increased by 8.9% to 54,630. Transactions greater than $100,000 rose from 407 on April 29 to 490 on April 30, and total exchange inflows increased from $21.9 million to $30.5 million.

However, the recent price drops have reduced the percentage of Dogecoin holders currently in profit from 83% to 78%.

Shibariumscan [data](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats) points to a surge in active accounts, from 1,724 on April 29 to 3,650 on April 30. Transaction fees have also witnessed a substantial increase, rising from 12.07 BONE to 61.47 BONE.

**Price Action**: At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1274 and SHIB is trading at $0.000022, down 0.9% and 3.9% on the day, respectively.

**What’s Next**: The influence of meme coins and [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment) is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19.

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin layer-2 project Stacks (STX) has announced a significant delay in the activation of the much-anticipated Nakamoto update. The delay was due to the need for an additional eight weeks of development time.

Mitchell Cuevas, who heads the Stacks Open Internet Foundation, detailed the reasons behind the delay in a recent blog post. Cuevas explained that, armed with more knowledge and practical experience with the features of the new network, the core developers determined that they needed a more advanced Signer resiliency/recovery system. This was something originally planned for a later release.

As a result, they anticipate an additional eight weeks of development and testing time before the second hard fork, which will bring Nakamoto features to us in 'Activation'. The new Signer flexibility features are expected to be completed by July 15, with Activation to begin on August 28.

Cuevas acknowledged his disappointment that the dates were changed so late. He wrote: “Fast blocks can't get here fast enough. However, this change is being made to ensure the security and liveness of the network upgrade.”

STX has lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last month.

![Image 1: BONK surges 50%, flips FLOKI in market cap, but key hurdles remain](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bonk-sam-1200x686.jpeg)

*   _BONK Inu’s market cap rises to $1.40 billion, surpassing Floki Inu._
*   _Despite overall memecoin market downturn, BONK gains nearly 50% in two weeks._ 

As the broader crypto market continues to navigate turbulent waters with an overall downturn, the memecoin sector is not immune to the volatility, experiencing a significant drop of 13.3% in 24 hours. 

This decline has reduced the total market cap of meme coins to approximately $45.2 billion. Amid this general market retreat, a notable exception emerges—[Bonk \[BONK\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/bonk-news/).

#### **BONK becomes the fifth-largest memecoin**

While the majority of meme coins have faced downward pressure, Bonk has charted a different course.

Over the past two weeks, BONK has surged nearly 50%, contrasting sharply with the modest 3% gain of its peer, [Floki Inu \[FLOKI\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/floki-news/), according to recent [data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token) from CoinGecko. 

This growth has propelled BONK’s market valuation to $1.40 billion, enabling it to leapfrog over Floki Inu and secure its position as the fifth-largest memecoin in the market.

As a result, BONK now stands as the 58th largest cryptocurrency globally, surpassing well-known names such as [Aave \[AAVE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/aave-price-prediction) and [Algorand \[ALGO\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/algorand-price-prediction).

Emerging on the cryptocurrency scene in December 2022, Bonk initially flew under the radar until it caught the market’s attention a year later with a [dramatic price increase](https://ambcrypto.com/bonks-bullish-run-begins-but-why-you-should-stay-cautious/).

This surge was fueled by robust investor interest, endorsements from influential figures within the crypto community, and its inclusion on several major cryptocurrency exchange platforms. 

Notably, BONK also ranks as the second-largest memecoin on the [Solana \[SOL\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/solana-price-prediction) blockchain, trailing only [Dogwifhat \[WIF\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/dogwifcoin-price-prediction).

The latter experienced a significant market cap increase to nearly $5 billion at the end of March as well, before retracting to around $2.2 billion.

#### **BONK: Market outlook**

Despite the recent success of Bonk in overtaking its competition, technical analysis of both BONK and Floki Inu revealed potential challenges ahead.

The daily chart for BONK indicated a bearish pattern, with the memecoin’s price recently triggering a liquidity pull on the buy side, suggesting a possible downturn as it targets the next swing low.

Floki Inu’s 8-hour chart mirrored this sentiment, indicating potential declines for both meme coins in the near future.

Stablecoin issuer Tether, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market behind the widely used USDT stablecoin, has released its audit statement for the first quarter of 2024, accompanied by a report conducted by independent accounting firm BDO. 

The [report](https://tether.io/news/tether-releases-q1-2024-attestation-reports-record-breaking-4-52-billion-profit-highest-treasury-bill-ownership-percentage-ever-total-group-equity-of-11-37-billion/), which provides additional financial information beyond the reserves backing Tether’s fiat-denominated stablecoins, shows the company’s profit for the first quarter of the year, which saw an increased influx of capital into the market. 

Tether Q1 2024 Financials Soar
------------------------------

Digging into the numbers, the first quarter of 2024 proved highly profitable for Tether, with a net profit of $4.52 billion.

The main contributors, the entities responsible for issuing stablecoins and managing reserves, reportedly generated approximately $1 billion of this profit from net operating gains, primarily from [US Treasury holdings](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/tether-buys-8888-bitcoin/). The remaining profits were attributable to mark-to-market gains on Bitcoin (BTC) and gold positions.

The report also highlighted Tether’s success in increasing its direct and indirect holdings of US Treasuries to over $90 billion. This includes indirect exposure through overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries and investments in US Treasuries through [money market funds](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-usdt-tether-8888-btc/).

In a sign of significant growth, Tether also disclosed its net equity for the first time, revealing a figure of $11.37 billion as of March 31, 2024. This is an increase from the $7.01 billion equity reported as of December 31, 2023.

The report also highlighted a $1 billion increase in excess [reserves](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stablecoin-takeover-record-tether-71-dominance-raises-questions-about-crypto-future/), which support the company’s stablecoin offerings, bringing the total to nearly $6.3 billion.

CEO Emphasizes Transparency And Stability
-----------------------------------------

The BDO confirmation reiterated that Tether-issued tokens are 90% backed by cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the company’s stance on maintaining liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the report revealed that over $12.5 billion worth of USDT was issued in the first quarter alone.

Tether Group’s strategic investments, which exceed $5 billion as of the report date, span various sectors, including [artificial intelligence](https://www.newsbtc.com/tether/tether-launches-new-security-policy-freezes-41-sanctioned-wallets/) (AI) and data, renewable energy, person-to-person (P2P) communication, and Bitcoin Mining.

In response to the latest report, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed the company’s commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. 

Ardoino highlighted Tether’s record-breaking profit benchmark of $4.52 billion and the company’s efforts to increase [transparency](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/tether-usdt-cap-90-billion-why-affects-bitcoin/) and trust within the cryptocurrency industry. Ardoino further claimed:  

&gt; In reporting not just the composition of our reserves, but now the Group’s net equity of $11.37 billion, Tether is again raising the bar in the cryptocurrency industry in the realms of transparency and trust.

Will the SEC approve an [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&amp;p=5726)Ethereum ETF this year?

Optimism among market participants is fading—and now that the SEC’s stance on [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.

“If this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told _Decrypt_. 

That’s because of a [lawsuit filed last week](https://decrypt.co/228134/consensys-sues-sec-attempts-regulate-ethereum-security) by Ethereum software company [Consensys](https://decrypt.co/resources/consensys) against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an [unregistered security](https://decrypt.co/228504/sec-declared-ethereum-security-last-year-consensys-lawsuit)—and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in _Decrypt_.)

To be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant’s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers [accusing](https://decrypt.co/228870/sec-gensler-lied-congress-ethereum-patrick-mchenry) SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency’s position on ETH.

While the long-term impact of SEC’s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren’t happening—at least, not without another legal fight.

Spot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot [Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval](https://decrypt.co/210763/bitcoin-etf-approved-sec) for trading in the U.S. market in January—but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, [successfully sued the SEC](https://decrypt.co/154119/grayscale-wins-appeal-against-sec-to-convert-bitcoin-trust-to-etf) to make it happen.

Still, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts [assumed](https://decrypt.co/212478/bitcoin-etfs-are-here-when-ethereum-etf) spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren’t so sure.

[Gensler Lied to Congress About Ethereum, Says Rep. McHenry](https://decrypt.co/228870/sec-gensler-lied-congress-ethereum-patrick-mchenry)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry (R-NC) waded into the escalating feud between financial regulators and the crypto industry on Tuesday, accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of having “misled Congress” regarding the agency’s stance on Ethereum.  McHenry’s comments come following the revelation that the SEC has internally considered Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security for over a year, according to unredacted portions of a lawsuit filed against the regulator b...

Ethereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval [by May 23](https://decrypt.co/227817/blackrock-grayscale-amend-ethereum-etf-applications-after-sec-delays). By last month, analysts were [already cooling](https://decrypt.co/222439/ethereum-etf-may-2024-bitcoin-hype) on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week’s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go. 

Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC’s now-evident position on ETH’s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren’t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that’s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said. 

&gt; Yes dif rules, 33 act for commodities
&gt; 
&gt; — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) [April 29, 2024](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1784934711426511180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

It doesn’t appear, though, that the SEC’s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers—at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the [first-ever](https://decrypt.co/155204/cathie-woods-ark-invest-21shares-apply-for-first-spot-ethereum-etf) Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told _Decrypt_ that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved. 

Van Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well. 

The company’s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved “in time.” 

But he emphasized that Van Eck’s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week’s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.

“This has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,” he said. “Part of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.”

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge Zeus Network will launch its Zeus Program Library (ZPL) that connects the two ecosystems by Q3 2024. 

“These ZPL-Assets unlock a world of opportunities on Solana,” Zues Network [wrote](https://medium.com/@zeus-network/unlocking-connectivity-between-bitcoin-and-solana-with-zpl-zeus-program-library-126d0f9b4d9d) on May 1. “Facilitating activities like DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, DePIN, and more, which were previously challenging on the Bitcoin blockchain.”

ZPL is a set of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) programs that enables developers to integrate native Solana support into decentralized applications and power transactions across multiple blockchains. “ZPL-Assets can be either fungible (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (NFTs), representing a wide range of digital assets,” commented Zeus Network, continuing: 

&gt; “With a market cap of approximately 1.2 trillion dollars, and over 11,000 Runes generating over $135 million in fees within the first week on the Bitcoin blockchain, the potential for value transfer is immense.”

Through ZPL and bridging protocol Apollo, users deposit their Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and, in return, receive ZPL-wrapped zBTC tokens, which can then be used to engage with decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, borrowing, lending, gaming and SocialFi within the Solana ecosystem. 

Developers plan to further expand ZPL-supported assets on Solana to Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals, dubbed “zRuneX” and “zOrdX,” respectively. Other tasks in its Q3 roadmap include enabling Bitcoin staking on its Apollo mainnet. 

Zeus Network is backed by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali. On April 8, the protocol [secured](https://twitter.com/ZeusNetworkHQ/status/1775855748276167018) a $8 million funding round at a valuation of $100 million. 

Released in April, Bitcoin Runes is a new token standard that [expands the functionality](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/runes-supporters-unlock-bitcoins-potential/) of the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling users to tokenize various real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking transfer, and minting of unique assets on the namesake blockchain. 

The Bitcoin decentralized application ecosystem has been experiencing a revival with the invention of such novel protocols. Last month, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables [BRC-20 token swaps](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/6b-scam-accused-court-china-loophole-hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-asia-express/).

Ronin goes against the grain when it comes to the Web3 philosophy. 

For many in the crypto space, the beauty of the blockchain is that it’s permissionless and that anyone can build without a centralized authority. Instead, the [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) sidechain gaming network instead opts for a closed, curated approach at present.

There’s a reason for this kind of early approach, the team says—and it's hard to argue with success, given the vast rise in Ronin players in recent months, plus its [surge to an all-time high price](https://decrypt.co/221552/ronin-all-time-high-ethereum-gaming-network-free-kairdro-nft-mint) in March ahead of the recent markets cooldown.

And there's a path to a “pervasively permissionless” [Ronin](https://decrypt.co/price/ronin) network ahead.

“There are too many developers, too many applications, and too many games,” [Sky Mavis](https://decrypt.co/124884/sky-mavis-signs-deals-with-directive-games-bali-games-tribes-and-bowled-to-build-web3-games) and Ronin co-founder Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin told _Decrypt_. “There are more applications, games, and developers than there are actual real people using these applications.”

['Match Made in Heaven': Why Ethereum RPG Kaidro Migrated to Ronin](https://decrypt.co/226124/match-made-heaven-why-ethereum-rpg-kaidro-migrated-ronin)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anime-inspired role-playing game Kaidro has already made waves on Ethereum scaling network Ronin since announcing its plans to migrate in February. A buzzy free mint in March saw nearly 350,000 free NFTs claimed by Ronin wallets, while Kaidro’s first premium mint on Ronin this week sold out some 9,999 Spark Suit NFTs—with 2,400 of those going in a public sale in just 10 seconds—generating $2 million in the process and pushing Kaidro to become the third most-traded collection on the Mavis Market....

Many open blockchains have an “overabundance” of games, Zirlin believes, while the relatively small number of gamers that are playing in this space struggle to sift through the good and the bad. To battle this dilemma, [Ronin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ronin-ethereum-gaming-chain-behind-axie-infinity-pixels) curates the games that are allowed on its network.

In his personal time—and aside from crypto games—Zirlin only plays games by Nintendo, Blizzard, and Supercell. They’re giants of the industry known for releasing few games, and often really beloved and massively popular games at that.

By curating Ronin’s game library, he believes that the network is aligning itself with these game publishers. In fact, he suggests that the Web3 element “adds another layer on top” by incentivizing gamers to support the network through its token.

“This strategy emphasizes quality over quantity, allowing us to work closely with fewer teams and ensure their long-term success in the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming,” Zirlin explained. “\[A Twitter poll\] [showed us that 40%](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1776637871748730899) of all \[Axie\] gamers were onboarded by a friend or family member. So these are insane levels of evangelism.” ['Apeiron' Open Beta: Should You Play This Clever Mashup of Strategy Genres?](https://decrypt.co/228218/apeiron-open-beta-should-you-play-clever-strategy-mashup)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bored of all trading card games feeling the same? Apeiron blends together a spectrum of genres to produce a refreshing experience. While in closed beta on PC, the game launched a play-to-airdrop campaign which attracted an audience on the Ronin network. Now in open beta via the Epic Games Store and Mavis Hub, players are giving the game a spin and finding the game is more than just token-fueled hype—it’s actually quite good. Apeiron’s unique concoction gives the game a distinct feel, fun and str...

In turn, Ronin accounts for 30% of all active Web3 gamers, the largest share by some margin with Polygon in second at 17%, according to [Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/research/gamefi/game-overview/game-market?series_date-79421=past90days). Despite the model working for Ronin, most of Web3 opts against such an approach.

“In order to win, you need to do non-consensus things. That’s where most of the strategic leverage is,” Zirlin explained. “People want chaos, I guess, in Web3. But for the adoption of a new technology, you need to be more zen. You don't want to confuse people, because the technology is already confusing enough.”

Thus far, a curated approach appears to have served Ronin well. The doors will only be closed for so long, however, as Zirlin admits that open models do have advantages in the long run—and Ronin is indeed eyeing up a more open future.

[](https://decrypt.co/videos/interviews/3GbWbSMh/pixels-founder-luke-barwikowski-on-the-games-wild-rise-and-ronin-move) Looking down the path, one major hurdle in Ronin’s way is scalability. Currently, Ronin claims, the network can handle 7.5 million daily transactions without congestion. This may not be enough once the network is opened to all builders, so Sky Mavis is [actively exploring](https://roninchain.com/blog/posts/scalability-on-ronin) scaling solutions to increase what Ronin can handle. But scaling isn’t just a technical leap, said Zirlin—it’s also a cultural challenge.

“Ultimately, the key factor in scalability is not just technical superiority, but also user adoption and loyalty,” Zirlin explained. “Similar to the console wars of the past, where players chose platforms based on where their friends were, our focus is on curating games that draw players to Ronin.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic Ragnarok Online gaming franchise is coming to Ethereum thanks to a partnership between developer Gravity and Ronin, a sidechain gaming network. Gravity will launch Ragnarok: Monster World, a strategy game based in the Ragnarok Online universe, on Ronin. Ragnarok Online, an iconic massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has amassed over 167 million downloads globally since its 2002 launch in South Korea, is making its blockchain debut with Ragnarok: Monster World....

Once Ronin turns “pervasively permissionless,” Zirlin said, he expects the number of games deploying on Ronin to accelerate. He hopes one of these games will help drive growth for the network, as current game [Pixels](https://decrypt.co/resources/pixels-ronin-farming-game-airdrop-ethereum) is doing at present and [Axie Infinity](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-axie-infinity-the-play-to-earn-nft-game-taking-crypto-by-storm) did back during the [play-to-earn](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-play-to-earn-games-how-players-are-making-a-living-with-nfts) boom in 2021—but this time without such a heavy-handed approach from Ronin.

When Ronin plans open up the network is still undecided. Once this path ends and Ronin opens its doors, the network will begin to eye up its next big transformation—expanding beyond gaming.

“The endgame is to create an ecosystem that seamlessly blends gaming with ecommerce and payment apps,” Zirlin told _Decrypt_.  "We believe the path to getting there is by bootstrapping adoption and attention through gaming, and then expanding into payments and ecommerce, thereby disrupting the predatory banking system and credit card industry.”

The $6.6 billion market cap niche of Solana meme coins finds room to grow in a day when Bitcoin slides.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solana’s 10 largest meme coins by market cap are all showing gains in the last 24 hours, [according](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins) to data aggregator CoinGecko. While Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins wobble, tokens such as POPCAT and MANEKI soar by two digits.

The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, announced today that there will be no more interest rate cuts until inflation shows stronger signs of going back to 2%. This means that risk assets, such as stocks and crypto, will still be less favorable than US Treasuries. At the time of writing, BTC had fallen 2.7% over the past hour.

Despite this, MANEKI has shown significant 38% growth in the last 24 hours, while POPCAT shot up 24.8% in the same period. Other cat-themed coins with positive performances are MEW and WEN, rising 3% and 6.5% respectively.

WIF, the biggest meme coin on Solana by market cap, also registered 3.7% growth, followed by a 3% price increase from BONK. BOME, the token airdropped to investors of the first ‘meme coin pre-sale mania’ from Solana this year, exhibits the smallest of gains in the group, rising nearly 2%.

The total market cap for meme coins created on Solana sits at over $6.6 billion, surpassing $1.6 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours. According to CoinGecko, they represent the 40th largest crypto niche by market cap, out of 217 in total.

Earlier today, in an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Laxman Narasimhan provided a candid look at the company’s disappointing fiscal Q2 2024 results. Yesterday, Starbucks issued a detailed [press release](https://investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2024/Starbucks-Reports-Q2-Fiscal-2024-Results/default.aspx) shedding light on the complexities and strategic adjustments the company is navigating through these challenging times.

Starbucks reported a 2% decline in consolidated net revenues, amounting to $8.6 billion, which the company attributes to a complex operating environment. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at $0.68, marking a significant decrease from the previous year, with GAAP earnings per share down by 14% and Non-GAAP earnings per share down by 8%.

Key performance highlights from the fiscal second quarter include:

*   **Global Comparable Store Sales:** There was a 4% decline overall, driven by a sharp 6% decrease in transactions but partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket prices.
*   **North American Performance:** Comparable store sales in North America fell by 3%, with transactions down 7%, though mitigated slightly by a 4% rise in average ticket prices.
*   **International Markets:** International comparable store sales saw a 6% decrease, with an 11% decline in China due to significant drops in both ticket prices and transaction volumes.

The company also continued its expansion, opening 364 net new stores globally, bringing the total count to 38,951 stores, split between company-operated and licensed outlets.

The operating margin showed a contraction, with GAAP operating margins decreasing by 240 basis points to 12.8%. This was primarily due to increased investments in store partner wages, benefits, and promotional activities. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is committed to its long-term strategy and is actively implementing the “Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps” strategy, aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring future growth.

The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program reported an increase in 90-day active members in the U.S. to 32.8 million, up by 6% from the previous year. This highlights a resilient aspect of Starbucks’ customer engagement strategy despite broader market challenges.

The Starbucks CEO remarked on the quarter’s performance, “In a highly challenged environment, this quarter’s results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead.” He emphasized the comprehensive roadmap and action plans the company has laid out to navigate through the current complexities.

CFO Rachel Ruggeri also commented on the financial discipline and strategic focus, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to capital allocation and operational efficiencies as they steer through dynamic market conditions.

The Starbucks share price closed at $74.44, down 15.88% on the day.

The 150th Kentucky Derby on May 4 could have more people paying attention to the superfecta odds and top four finishers [than in past years](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/kentucky-derby).

**What Happened:** Virtual horse racing game **Photo Finish LIVE** [announced](https://photofinish.live/news/article/celebrate-the-150th-kentucky-derby-with-photo-finish-live-and-a-free-chance-to-win-100000) a SuperFecta Scratch-Off event that will offer a $100,000 prize to one lucky winner.

SuperFecta tickets are [minted](https://mint.photofinish.live/) for free plus the cost of gas on the Base Network, a Layer 2 from **Coinbase Global** COIN. Photo Finish Live parent company **Third Time Entertainment** counts Coinbase as an investor.

"As a portfolio company of Coinbase Ventures, it felt long overdue for us to build a seamless experience that works with the Coinbase Wallet to set the stage for an unprecedented FREE MINT event — featuring 116,280 Superfecta tickets, a collection guaranteed to include one $100,000 lucky winner.

Users can mint the tickets with Coinbase Wallet or several other supported wallets until the tickets are all reserved. Each user can mint three tickets for free. The scratch-offs can then be revealed and sold on exchanges [like](https://magiceden.io/collections/base/0x3bf097eb787be3ed0b871a02590382ff642933ed) Magic Eden.”

Photo Finish LIVE partnered with **Churchill Downs** CHDN in 2023 to attract new fans to [live and virtual racing.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38365133/exclusive-madden-gaming-veteran-leads-play-to-earn-horse-racing-game-photo-finish-into-new)

"A year ago, Churchill Downs entrusted Third Time Games with helping bring a younger generation of fans to horse racing," Third Time Games CEO **Ian Cummings** told Benzinga. "Superfecta Scratch-Off is our fun way of connecting web3 technology and digital assets to the actual Kentucky Derby results."

Other prizes, including free unraced virtual horses, will also be offered to owners of Superfecta scratch off tickets.

**What's Next**: The Superfecta tickets are available until they are all claimed or until the race on Saturday. As of Tuesday, Photo Finish reported that over 26,000 of the 116,280 tickets had been claimed.

The 150th running of the Kentucky Derby takes place on Saturday May 4, 2024 at Churchill Downs Racetrack.

Coverage of the race starts at 2:30 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock, units owned by **Comcast Corporation** CMCSA. The Kentucky Derby is scheduled to race at 6:57 p.m. ET.

"We believe this will have thousands of people who otherwise haven't been introduced to horse racing previously now paying attention to the results of the race on Saturday night," Cummings told Benzinga.

Twenty horses are set to compete in the 150th Kentucky Derby with a $3.1 million prize available for the first-place finisher and a total prize pool of $5 million for the top five finishers.

The 2023 Kentucky Derby [saw Mage win](https://www.benzinga.com/general/sports-betting/23/05/32270092/heres-how-much-100-bet-on-mage-to-win-kentucky-derby-paid-out-and-how-you-could-have-owned). The 18-to-1 odds horse paid out $32.42 to anyone who placed a $2 wager on the win. A $1 Superfecta bet that correctly predicted the order of the top four horses (8, 3, 14, 11) paid out $15,643.

The current favorites for the 2024 race and their gate position are:

*   16\. Fierceness: 5-2
*   2\. Sierra Leone: 3-1
*   4\. Catching Freedom: 8-1
*   10\. Forever Young: 10-1
*   8\. Just a Touch: 10-1

This means the favorite Superfecta tickets right now would be 16-2-4-10 or 16-2-4-8. But as anyone who has watched or bet on horse racing knows, anything can happen.

Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.

Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
----------------------------------------------------------------

It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.

The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.

The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.

This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.

The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.

Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.

They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

URL Source: https://www.bankless.com/economic-wobbles-hit-crypto-hard

Markdown Content:
**Macro Mania.** Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. _Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?_

Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.

Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have [gotten bullish](https://x.com/blknoiz06/status/1785718067554648365?ref=bankless.ghost.io) on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.

Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.

BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…

Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!

Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.

In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after [inventory levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/crude-oil-prices-today.html?ref=bankless.ghost.io) exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.

Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.

While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, [decreasing](https://x.com/FedGuy12/status/1785732034012274930?ref=bankless.ghost.io) the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.

The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.

Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.

Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:

1.  Optimism (OP) – 541
2.  Hedera (HBAR) – 459
3.  Cardano (ADA) – 432
4.  Chainlink (LINK) – 397

It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.

This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

Nearly 14,000 wallets have triggered withdrawals from the Ethereum restaking protocol since April 29.

DeFi traders are leaving EigenLayer in droves since the much-hyped Ethereum restaking protocol released its [airdrop allocations](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-to-drop-token-on-may-10) two days ago.

Since April 29, almost 14,000 wallets have initiated withdrawals from the protocol, accounting for roughly 13% of its [user base](https://dune.com/queries/3592801/6052719).

EigenLayer Withdrawals

EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/). It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).

Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune [dashboard](https://dune.com/hahahash/eigenlayer). That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.

Daily LST Withdrawals

The project is facing [severe backlash](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigen-airdrop-elicits-pushback-from-eigenlayer-community) from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.

Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens. Many community members also criticized the linear distribution of EIGEN, which favours larger depositors.

**Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-explainer/)) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows.** 

With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.

The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
------------------------------------

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 

This indicator is vital for [SHIB’s short-term trajectory](https://beincrypto.com/shib-continues-price-correction-whats-next/), serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.

Conversely, [SHIB has some potential bullish signals](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-trigger-rally-for-shib/) on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move.

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025.

Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.

As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.

Markdown Content:
As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time.

However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here?
---------------------------

In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to [plunge](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analysts-bullish-on-bitcoin-despite-peter-schiffs-20000-doom-scenario/) from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering.

This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull [examined](https://twitter.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1785617072296206825) some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in.

According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom.

In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the [flagship cryptocurrency](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-odds-in-bitcoin-bulls-favor-these-analysts-forecast-btcs-future/) might “wick through the support and bounce back.”

According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023.

Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top.

Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle
------------------------------------

According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the [post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785661251357487123), today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023.

The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think.

&gt; 
&gt; We are here (orange circle)
&gt; 
&gt; And we've seen Post-Halving pullbacks like this in the past (e.g. 2016)[$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#BitcoinHalving](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinHalving?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/OvOcmJTzFk](https://t.co/OvOcmJTzFk)
&gt; 
&gt; — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785600472029466670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the [resemblances](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-getting-ready-for-an-explosive-breakout-these-analysts-believe-so/) include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.”

After today’s retrace, the analyst [added](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785599091893846428) the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.”

Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.”

As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

*   _BNB tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period owing to broader market bloodbath._
*   _The positive commentary around the coin increased dramatically in the last 24–48 hours._

[Binance Coin \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) suffered substantial losses in the last 24 hours, as the broader market downturn took its toll on the native token of the Binance ecosystem.

The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period, data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/) showed.

However, on a monthly time frame, the coin performed comparatively better against other leading coins, nursing losses of just 6%.

That being said, BNB could be in for healthy gains in the short to medium term, as a major chapter, which fueled considerable FUD for the coin in the recent past, reached a conclusion.

#### A short-term bullish catalyst?

Binance’s ex-boss, Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, was [sentenced](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-billionaire-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/) to four months in prison, for the charges brought against him by the U.S. government.

The charges were severe, including violation of anti-money-laundering rules that allowed illicit transactions on the exchange.

The news of the announcement set the social circles buzzing. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the mention of BNB on top crypto-focused social channels surged dramatically.

Interestingly, positive commentary around the coin exceeded bearish takes, as weighted sentiment entered the positive territory. This suggested a more favorable view of BNB’s next moves by the market.

#### Futures traders not hopeful of quick rebound

BNB’s sentiment in the derivatives market continued to be bearish.

The number of traders shorting the crypto increased considerably in the last 24 hours, AMBCrypto spotted using Coinglass’ Long/Shorts Ratio indicator.

The [Open Interest (OI)](https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest), or the money invested in active futures contracts of BNB, dropped 1.27% in the last 24 hours to $564 million.

While this might be due to the broader market downturn, BNB could see investments trickling in once the sentiment improves.

Cathie Wood, one of the most famous investors, revised her previous Bitcoin price prediction of $ 1.5 million.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is known for her bold predictions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Despite the skepticism surrounding these predictions, they continue to attract the attention of investors and analysts alike.

At an investor day in New York, Wood made a surprising prediction. According to Wood, Bitcoin price could rise to a staggering $3.8 million by 2030.

In his own words, Wood expressed his prediction as follows:

&gt; “Last year, we put forward our bullish scenario for Bitcoin. This figure was $1.5 million. With the institutional green light provided by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), albeit difficult, according to our analysis, institutional investors invested a little more than 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. “If they do, and we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the estimate I gave you.”

Wood's prediction is based on the assumption that institutional investors will start investing heavily in Bitcoin. If Wood's prediction proves correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million by 2030, a modest investment of $1,000 today could potentially rise to over $60,000. However, there are also many analysts who are skeptical of Wood's prediction, considering it only has 5.5 years to come true.

Despite the [current market downtrend](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-3-metrics-solid-healthy-bull-market/), crypto traders are still finding ways to make life-changing gains. This is the case of some [Solana meme coin traders](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/) who recently turned $6,400 into $8 million in 24 hours. 

[On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain](https://bitcoinist.com/tron-founder-justin-sun-gets-new-wallet-heres-what-hes-buying/) revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a [meme coin on Solana](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/). 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.

These wallets then transferred their $TIM holdings (now worth around $8.28 million) to multiple addresses to avoid drawing attention. On-chain data shows that they are already looking to secure their profits, as they have been selling their $TIM tokens, although in small bits, to avoid a market crash.

Meme coins (especially ones on Solana) have continued to provide traders with significant gains, especially with Bitcoin and other major cap cryptocurrencies maintaining a downward trend. Bitcoinist [previously reported](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/) of a trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million with Dogwifhat (WIF) by getting in early on the meme coin while it was still a micro-cap token. 

Meanwhile, more recently, pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier was [reported](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-100-8-3-million-ethereum/) to have turned $353 into $8.3 million by investing in $KEYCAT, a [meme coin on Base](https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/). The layer-2 network (like Solana) has witnessed an influx of meme coin traders thanks to the barrage of meme coins that continue to launch on the network daily.

More Recent Success Stories
---------------------------

Lookonchain also recently revealed a trader who turned [$9,770 into $10 million](https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-1-6-million-bsc-meme-coin/) in just a day. The trader spent 64.5 SOL to [buy](https://t.co/GTaRgN09X7) 97.36 million $GUMMY (another [Solana-based meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/bonk-bullish-massive-burn/)) in the “same block where the $GUMMY deployer added liquidity.” Another trader [turned](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1782467836969205889) $110,000 into 48.72 million in just 3 hours by buying $MANEKI.

Although this trader wasn’t the first to buy the [meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-market-cap-100-billion-bull-cycle/), he used $716 SOL to acquire 1.02 billion $MANEKI (11.51% of the token’s supply) less than one minute after the token launched. Like the $TIM traders, he distributed these $MANEKI tokens across different wallets to avoid drawing attention. 

Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there is an ugly side to [meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/pepe-flip-dogecoin-shiba-inu/) trading, as some traders have also recorded significant losses. One is a trader who [recently](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1784804956073291842) spent 1,600 SOL to buy $COOL and ended up [selling](https://t.co/YSbJWfPzAJ) the meme coin for 532.58 SOL, losing 1,067.42 ($152,000) in the process.

Oregon has become the sixth state to revoke, suspend or decline to renew Binance.US’ license to operate there, following a spate of refusals earlier this year. 

The Oregon Division of Financial Regulation announced on April 30 that it had revoked Binance.US’s license, as a result of which it is prohibited from accepting money for transmission or holding or selling fiat or crypto for Oregon consumers. The division [explained](https://dfr.oregon.gov/news/news2024/Pages/20240430-Binance-Revocation.aspx) in a statement:

&gt; “Due to the nature of the felonies committed by \[former Binance CEO Changpeng\] Zhao, the Division has revoked Binance.US's money transmission license.” Oregon was following the example of five states that moved against the exchange after Zhao pleaded guilty to violating Anti-Money Laundering laws. Florida [was the first state to act](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-banned-florida-alaska), suspending Binance.US’ license in November, shortly after Zhao’s guilty plea. Alaska followed suit at the beginning of January when it declined to renew its license.

North Carolina [suspended](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/Artifact/Other.pdf?q=303764-394428) Binance.US’ license on January 23, and Maine [declined](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/Artifact/Other.pdf?q=303753-394417) to renew its license on January 29. According to a local press report, Connecticut [suspended](https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/ct-seeks-to-block-crypto-exchange-binance-from-operating-in-state-founder-sentenced-to) Binance.US’ license on April 24.

Binance.US never received licenses in New York, Texas, Vermont and Hawaii.

According to one page on the Binance.US website, its services are [unavailable](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360046786914-List-of-Unsupported-States) in Georgia and Ohio as well, although another page indicates that the exchange [has](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050532193-Licenses) licenses there. Binance [opened](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/binance-opens-a-regional-hub-in-georgia-8854914046327976377) a regional hub in Georgia with a staff of 25 in March 2023. Its license in Minnesota does not cover the exchange or transmission of virtual currency.

That is not the full extent of Binance.US’ troubles. Binance.US chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett [said in a court deposition](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-sec-lawsuit-choking-business-layoff-revenue) in December that the exchange had taken a “near-mortal blow,” forcing it to lay off over 200 staff members, due to U.S. banks’ unwillingness to work with it.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [sued Binance in June](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations). In that suit, the SEC claimed that Binance.US had failed to register as an exchange, broker and clearing agency. It further alleged that Binance.US lacked controls over “manipulative trading,” engaged in wash trading and had commingled funds with Binance, which created Binance.US in 2019 under regulatory pressure.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) price dropped 5.42% over the last 24 hours to hit a new multi-week low at $57,151 on May 1. On-chain data shows that a slowdown in Bitcoin demand growth and increased open short positions may be responsible for the latest drawdown, and it’s possible that new lows will be in store for BTC.

![Image 1: a chart of the usd - ecb - ecb - ecb - ec](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/ae49e572-65a6-40ca-a870-f4b4269bb648.png)

Reporting from CryptoQuant attributes [BTC’s latest decline](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today) to a slowdown in demand characterized by decreased growth in Bitcoin balances among permanent holders, [slowing spot Bitcoin ETF demand](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-demand-negative-btc-halving#:~:text=Demand%20for%20the%20newest%20Bitcoin,after%20launching%20in%20January%202024.) and an increase in short positions in the futures market.

CryptoQuant data shows that demand from permanent holders (investors who only purchase Bitcoin and never sell) fell by 50% in April, from over 200,000 BTC in late March to about 90,000 BTC.

&gt; “Accelerating demand growth is needed for prices to bottom and eventually rally significantly.”

![Image 2: a graph showing the price of bitcoin](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/013a5e28-2ab5-42cd-9783-6b019685c0b7.png)

The chart above reveals that this metric has “reached levels similar to early March when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,” dropping 7% immediately after breaching its all-time highs.

[Demand from whales](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-accumulation-phase-btc-halving-week-away) has been declining since late March,, and according to CryptoQuant analysts, BTC price corrections are usually driven by slower growth in demand from large investors.

&gt; “Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”

![Image 3: a graph showing the price of bitcoin](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/6e7cb51f-6e54-47a8-bb7b-ea42be4b463f.png)

The analysts also said that the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was evinced by declining purchases from spot ETFs in the U.S., which also added to the sell-side pressure.

“The daily purchase of Bitcoin from ETFs has plummeted to basically zero currently, after peaking in mid-March at more than $1 billion,” noted the report, adding that "a new wave of Bitcoin purchases from ETFs is needed to refresh demand growth.”

Another metric that the on-chain data analytics firm used to explain the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was the “traders’ unwillingness to pay more to open long positions” as sell orders outpace buy orders.

![Image 4: a chart showing the price of a stock](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/3862b225-4ca5-457b-b7df-9653ea548cfc.png)

_Bitcoin funding rates. Source: CryptoQuant_

Bitcoin’s funding rate has dropped to a year-to-date low, indicating traders’ unwillingness to “pay as much as before to open long positions.”

Instead, “the recent price decline has been caused by traders opening short positions, expecting prices to decline further,” the report noted.

Analysts agree that downside is the likely direction for Bitcoin price
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ongoing [market correction](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today) has left market participants wondering [how low Bitcoin price can go](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go) before a trend reversal occurs.

CryptoQuant analysts set the lower target within the $55,000 to $57,000 demand zone, which is “10% below the current cost basis of traders of $63,000.” Traders’ cost basis has been known to offer support for prices during bull markets.

&gt; “The current Bitcoin price is already below traders’ cost basis.”

For popular analyst Scott Melker, $52,000 is as low as the BTC price can go in the short term. Melker [said](https://x.com/scottmelker/status/1785596055125434827) the correction is still mild for a bull market since the daily RSI is not yet oversold.

&gt; “This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”

Continuing, Tuur Demeester, a Bitcoin analyst, spotted BTC trading at $60,409, [saying](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1785435223687049378) $50,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin now that the $60,000 support was lost.

_Source:_ [_Tuur Demeester_](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1785435223687049378)

Trader and analyst Mags [said](https://x.com/thescalpingpro/status/1785573452243775528) that if Bitcoin closes below $60,000 on the weekly timeframe, traders should “expect a much deeper retracement, till $40,000 and even lower.”

Markdown Content:
Cryptocurrency company **Coinbase Global** COIN will report first-quarter (Q1) financial results after market close on [Thursday, May 2, 2024.](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings)

Read on for earnings estimates, [analyst ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/COIN/analyst-ratings), price targets and the key items to watch:

**Ratings &amp; Targets**:

*   HC Wainwright: Buy rating, raised price target from $250 to $300
*   JPMorgan: Neutral rating, $150 price target
*   Bernstein: Market Perform rating, raised price target from $80 to $200
*   Compass Point: Buy rating, raised price target from $235 to $325
*   Mizuho Securities: Underperform rating, raised price target from $84 to $145
*   Piper Sandler: Neutral rating, raised price target from $225 to $245
*   Bank of America: Underperform rating, raised price target from $92 to $110

**Earnings Estimates:** Analysts expect Coinbase to report first-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, according to [data from Benzinga Pro.](https://www.benzinga.com/pro/feature/newsfeed?gspk=bHVrZWphY29iaTUzNDg&amp;gsxid=tdEE0VrK8Jeg&amp;ref=lukejacobi5348)

The company reported revenue of $772.53 million in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in five straight quarters.

Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.00 for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 34 cents in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last five quarter, including four consecutive quarters.

The company has not guided for revenue estimates but [said previously it expects](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/02/37169863/coinbase-q4-earnings-revenue-beat-surprise-profit-crypto-update-and-more) first-quarter subscription and services revenue to be in a range of $410 million to $480 million.

**What Analysts Say**: The first quarter was an "eventful quarter for the cryptoecosystem," JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said.

The analyst said Coinbase could be a key beneficiary of the increased trading activity.

Worthington expects Coinbase to post subscription and services revenue of $450 million. The analyst also sees Base, which is Coinbase's Layer 2 platform, contributing more meaningful in the quarter at around $20 million in net revenue.

"We see Coinbase as both a leading driver and beneficiary of the cryptocurrency economy, and we previously underestimated the strength of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its early days – launched January 2024 – as a key catalyst for the crypto industry," Worthington said.

The analyst said Coinbase's revenue generation could benefit in the short term with a crypto rally.

"We see the longer term success of Coinbase being driven by development, with our focus on tokenization and payments."

**Key Items to Watch:** When Coinbase reported fourth-quarter financial results, the company said its three main priorities for 2024 would be driving revenue through improving core trading, driving utility in crypto with experiments in payments and driving regulatory clarity for the industry.

Investors and analysts will watch for all of these items in the upcoming quarterly report.

The biggest item likely watched by those looking at Coinbase will be the impact [the approval and launch](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36514679/wall-street-enters-the-crypto-age-sec-issues-historic-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs) of **Bitcoin** BTC/USD ETFs had on the company in the first quarter.

Investors will also be looking to see how big of an impact on trading volume and transaction revenues Bitcoin had compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represented 31% of trading volume and 29% of transaction revenues in the fourth quarter.

The balance of transaction revenue with the company's subscription and services revenue could also be something to monitor. The transaction revenue is larger but can also be more volatile from quarter to quarter, while the subscription and services revenue is growing and also important for the company increasing efforts for profitability.

**COIN Price Action**: Coinbase shares were up 3% to $210.09 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $46.43 to $283.48.

_Wednesday, May 01, 2024_ – An ongoing presale for Solana’s greatest multichain good boy [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) ($DOGEVERSE) has taken in $13 million so far, with at least $2 million flooding into the ICO in the five days since it deployed on Solana.

Crypto’s latest Shiba Inu-inspired funny token has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see Dogeverse’s hyper-jumping cross-chain capabilities as a hint of tomorrow’s meme coin capabilities.

Now SOL fans are in on the action too. As of Friday, April 26, Dogeverse has rolled out on its sixth native chain, Solana, joining a digital economy that is home to [$3.465 billion](https://defillama.com/chain/Solana) in total value locked (TVL), with [1.13 million active users](https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/solana/number-of-active-addresses-on-the-solana-network-daily-7dma) transacting daily and over [2,500 monthly active developers](https://solana.com/news/2023-state-of-solana-developer-ecosystem).

Since Dogeverse exists on multiple chains, it can be purchased by anyone on Ethereum ($ETH), BNB Smart Chain ($BNB), Polygon ($MATIC), Avalanche ($AVAX), Base ($BASE) and now Solana ($SOL) to spare.

To purchase with SOL, simply head to the [website](https://thedogeverse.com/en) and select “Buy With SOL” from the drop-down menu of the buy widget. Doing so will transport users to a Solana-based version of the site hosted on [solana.thedogeverse.com](http://solana.thedogeverse.com/).

The option to pay with Solana is hosted on a subdomain, due to wallet connect functions not being able to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana-integrated wallets in tandem.

The SOL-specific version of the Dogeverse website also adds the ability to buy tokens using Circle’s hugely popular USDC, which is the stablecoin of choice on the Solana network,

The Dogeverse ICO and Beyond
----------------------------


Currently priced at $0.000304 and due to rise in a few days, [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) sold out its initial soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launching at the beginning of April.

A heady $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated to the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.

This enabled [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) to move onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens are being sold to the public across the remaining rounds before the presale closes. Initially, this was planned for June 11, however, due to the immense success of the presale, it’s likely to conclude substantially earlier.

The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used to bolster liquidity to ensure high-volume trading and for buy-back funds.

Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.

The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.

Cosmo: Crypto’s New Hyper-Jumping Multi-Chain Good Boy
------------------------------------------------------


The market’s appetite for canine-themed coins began with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. Dogecoin didn’t need much of a sales pitch, because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)

Since then, many celebrities have professed their love for the novelty canine cryptocurrency, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, American entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg.

But fun as it may be, Dogecoin is not without its problems.

Since Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, it utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions. This means that the miners with the most computation and power mine the most Dogecoin. Like Bitcoin, mining DOGE consumes a lot of energy.

Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but all of them have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

To date, none of the alternative Dogecoins have seriously challenged the original’s dominance.

[Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) hopes to change that. It is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism.

At the center of the [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/) is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.

Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.

Dogeverse and the Ethereum ETF Saga
-----------------------------------


Analysts are anticipating potentially price-driving news this month, on May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for US spot Ethereum ETFs.

The date could mark the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.

So will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the [Dogeverse](https://thedogeverse.com/).

Given the fact that a federal court overturned the SEC’s earlier refusal of Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious” it’s possible that spot Ethereum ETFs will pass through unopposed, smashing the doors down for the approval of similar products for Solana and Avalanche.

The ETF effect is a very real catalyst, too. Earlier this year, the US launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs rallied the original cryptocurrency to set a new high watermark of $73,737.94 on March 14.

So Cosmo is a clean and green representative of not one, not two, but six different blockchain networks. And with staking capabilities, seamless multi-chain fun and a potentially catalytic news cycle in the coming months, what’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?

Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – Crypto’s latest cybernetic sausage dog sensation, AI meme coin WienerAI ($WAI), has added the most advanced beginner-friendly trading bot in crypto to its ecosystem in an ICO that has already attracted over $700,000 in three weeks.

The team is touting its new AI companion as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner” with user-friendly AI-enhanced trading, seamless swap functionality and zero fees. With unparalleled capabilities, WienerAI is the ultimate asset for every crypto trader.

It couldn’t be easier to get an edge, thanks to WienerAI. Just ask the bot a question relating to whatever your crypto investment needs are, and WienerAI will use its predictive technology to scour the markets to sniff out a winner for his owners, providing them with a breakdown of his logic and analysis.

![Image 5: winner ai the future of trading](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01205241/1714596761-9d165f859d1fec04f2df2c21ebfb2c3b.jpg)

Wiener’s swap feature allows his users to make fast, efficient token swaps and in a few clicks find the best prices available on DEXs.

It also has a reflexive edge over frontrunners, like MEV bots. These bots frontrun traders’ transactions in order to profit from minimizing their gains. WienerAI’s cybernetic capabilities get him in front of every frontrunner.

WienerAI recalls another successful recent token launch, canine meme coin and AI security token Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY), which netted close to $10 million in a recent presale.

Combining two hot niches, both $WAI and $SCOTTY have inspired investors with the promise of a new generation of coins that offer more laughs than run-of-the-mill AI coins and more utility than bog standard meme coins.

Other strong narratives driving the project are its eye-watering staking rewards, currently offering yields of 1241% per annum, its verified audit, and the fun, community-building storyline.

WienerAI: The Only Sausage/Dog/AI Hybrid
----------------------------------------


To begin with, investors have probably never heard an origin story like this before. Like his predecessor, Scotty the AI, WienerAI arrives on the scene with a fully-formed backstory.

Wiener was born in a lab in New Silicon Valley, AD 2132. His progenitor is a mad puppy-loving scientist known as The Architect, whose life’s work was to create an advanced AI/canine hybrid.

Indeed, he succeeded, albeit with one caveat. The Architect was eating a sausage as he was performing the splicing procedure. The accidental result was WienerAI, a hybrid of pup, AI and sausage.

Now, the [whitepaper](https://wienerdog.ai/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf) mentions “companionship” and “friendship” as key parts of Wiener’s premise. It also mentions “The Sausage Army”, the endearing term for the legions of followers Wiener hopes to attract, so there are subtle hints at a strong social component.

He’s not the first crypto doge with an army, but he may be the best.

WienerAI Wants To Take Over Crypto’s Doge Scene
-----------------------------------------------


The world’s first and favorite meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), also has an army: the self-styled “Doge Army”, but Wiener is aiming for a wider community and he has a decent battle cry to help him rally his sausage forces.

See, Dogecoin is one tired pupper. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is housed on its own blockchain, which is a spin on Bitcoin’s. Dogecoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which means that it’s the miners with access to the most power and/or computation that bag the most DOGE.

In a world of rising atmospheric temperatures and international climate targets, PoW is a growing concern among more conscientious investors.

WienerAI’s native chain, Ethereum, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where the miners that stake the most ETH get the most rewards. This is well over 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

Secondly, in an industry that was rocked by near-constant scandals and liquidity crises in the last two years, WienerAI offers the security of proper auditing. The WienerAI smart contract was [audited by Coinsult](https://coinsult.net/projects/wiener-ai/), a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. This gives investors added confidence in WienerAI.

Lastly, there’s the daily staking rewards. Some 20% of $WAI’s supply is earmarked for staking. Buyers can stake during the presale, and are in fact [encouraged](https://wienerdog.ai/en#howto) to do so on the website, in order to take advantage of the lucrative 1241% APY on offer at present.

Mysterious he may be, but it’s no mystery why investors are piling into WienerAI’s new presale. Everybody wants to get their hands on a tokenized piece of crypto’s most advanced beginner-friendly AI trading companion yet.

Bitcoin Traders Target Test of $53,000 Support as BTC Price Predictions Remains Bearish Following Fed Meeting

The Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating in the mid-$57,000s, down roughly 5% on the day, though up around 1.5% or $1,000 from earlier session lows as traders weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts this year in wake of the latest policy announcement from the US central bank.

As anticipated, the [Fed left interest rates](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-hold-rates-steady-inflation-dims-hopes-policy-easing-2024-05-01/) at multi-decade high levels of 5.25-5.5% and [slowed its balance sheet run-off](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-announces-reduction-balance-sheet-runoff-pace-2024-05-01/).

The central bank will now allow its portfolio of assets to shrink by only $25 billion per month. Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.

That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate. That could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.

At current levels, [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/) is trading hands roughly in line with where it was prior to the Fed’s announcement.

As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.

Gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than though, he commented.

The money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago, as per [CME data](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).

Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.

Net-net, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.

**Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?**
-------------------------------------


While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside incoming.

Prior to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.

That drop came after fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.

The drop from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures, and as ETF outflows accelerate.

As per data presented by [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/bitcoin-etf/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows), US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five straight days.

Importantly, Wednesday’s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.

The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.

A chorus of analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s, including at Standard Chartered.

&gt; Bitcoin will drop 13% to $50,000 after falling below a key support level as macro drivers slow, Standard Chartered says  
&gt; Bitcoin has fallen past the ETF purchase price of around $58,000, putting over half of ETF positions underwater, Standard Chartered wrote.

A few analysts mentioned the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 as important to watch.

“There might have been lots of ‘TradeFi’ tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving”, 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.  “This time is now over”.

“We expect more unwinding as… Bitcoin trades below $57,300”, he continued.

“This will likely lower prices to… a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top”.

That explains “our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks”, he concluded.

*   **The SEC may be set to approve leveraged ETH futures ETFs.**
*   **The likely approval comes despite an ongoing investigation into whether Ethereum is an unregistered security.**
*   **At the same time, the SEC continues to delay a decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.**

[The debacle](https://dailycoin.com/sec-reignites-ethereum-debate-yet-again-security-or-not/) over the SEC’s classification of [Ethereum](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-ethereum-blockchains-future-of-finance-explained/) is getting more complicated.

Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the regulator has the second largest crypto asset in terms of market cap in its cross-hairs, suspecting that the asset may be an unregistered security. For the observers, the situation recently got more complicated as [a recent ConsenSys complaint revealed](https://dailycoin.com/how-year-long-eth-security-probe-paints-sec-into-a-corner/) that the SEC’s Ethereum probe has been on for at least a year, months before the agency implicitly signed off on the CFTC’s classification of ETH as a commodity by approving ETH futures ETFs.

Adding to the growing confusion over the SEC’s stance, the agency now looks set to approve leveraged ETH ETF products.

Leveraged ETH Futures ETF Applicants Feeling “Optimistic”
---------------------------------------------------------

On Wednesday, May 1, _Fox Business_ journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that leveraged ETH futures ETF applicants felt “optimistic” about their chances of getting approval, citing persons familiar with the matter. The journalist disclosed that these institutions expressed this view based on “positive dialogue” from the SEC. 

&gt; 🚨SCOOP: Some issuers that have filed with the [@SECGov](https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for leveraged [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) futures ETFs describe “positive dialogue” with SEC staff over applications, one telling me they feel “optimistic” the agency will let the funds go into effect based on the engagement thus far.

&gt; — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1785448317645906211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

If the SEC gives the green light as they expect, Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) will be the first to go live on June 4.  As Terrett highlighted, approving these products will add another layer of intrigue to the Ethereum security status debacle.

By approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs, the SEC will be stirring further confusion by again implicitly accepting the CFTC’s classification of the crypto asset while having a pending investigation into whether it is a security.

Stressing the potential implications of the move, Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnsson asserted that the SEC’s decision on the matter would be “key to watch.”

&gt; This is key to watch. Beyond this, we know the SEC has historically requested voluntary withdrawals on similar ETH products within about a week of filing (when they don't want them to go effective). It's now been over 3 weeks for these. [https://t.co/QLM7vnNQUW](https://t.co/QLM7vnNQUW)
&gt; 
&gt; — Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1785675887163105287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Beyond the apparent inconsistencies in the regulator’s actions, from a risk perspective, most could not wrap their head around the logic of approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs while delaying spot ETFs.

“Make It Make Sense”
--------------------

For months, [the SEC has delayed](https://dailycoin.com/eth-etf-wait-continues-as-sec-delays-decision-on-two-filings/) its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, offering no reason for the delay except that it required more time to review applications. With the May 23 deadline for the agency to decide on VanEck’s application looming, the growing consensus among observers and even some applicants is that this application will be denied.

The possibility of the SEC first approving leveraged futures ETFs, which arguably pose greater investment risks over spot offerings, has rubbed many off as odd, to say the least.

Angel Investor Eric Conner sarcastically quipped, “Make so much sense… Much protection!”

Chiming in, The ETF Store, Inc. President Nate Geraci [added](https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1785461956138127870?t=xflxScFKTJnyUR4K8FOtWA&amp;s=19), “Somebody make it make sense.”

On the Flipside 
----------------

*   **The SEC has yet to approve the leveraged ETH futures ETFs officially.**
*   **It will not be the first time the SEC approved leveraged futures ETFs before the spot. The agency had approved leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs about six months before finally approving the spot product.**

Why This Matters
----------------

The likely approval of leveraged ETH futures ETFs adds further confusion to the uncertainty surrounding the agency’s classification of Ethereum.

[Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/these-altcoins-are-set-to-inject-billions-into-the-crypto/) following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment.

Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash
-----------------------------

In an analysis [posted](https://x.com/intocryptoverse/status/1785310389976043682) on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his [expectations for altcoins](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-altcoins-parabolic-curve/). According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come.

Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow.

[![Image 2: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112492)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368655&amp;setID=366606&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697925&amp;banID=521829427&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287437&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714606414330692&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Faltcoin%2Faltcoins-in-trouble-40-drop%2F&amp;hc=b1848a9801a825a1638b229c905d5740b5c86973&amp;location=)

The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said.

Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated.

If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The [altcoin market cap](https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-opportunity-zone-santiment-reveals/) has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion.

Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market
--------------------------------------

While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the [impact on altcoins](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/are-altcoins-cooling-off-analyst-weighs-in-on-this-cycles-market/) has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader [Dogecoin](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-traders-og-dogecoin-altcoins/) dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and [Shiba Inu](https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-surprise-binance-japan-listing-ignites-360-price-spike/) fell 4.18%.

Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with [Optimism (OP)](https://www.newsbtc.com/optimism-2/optimism-soars-by-17-despite-recent-security-revelations/) recording 12% gains. Cosmos (ATOM) followed with a 9.8% increase, and Starknet (STRK) rose 9%, making them the top gainers of the day, according to [data](https://coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/) from Coinmarketcap.

Despite the 7% pullback, Bitcoin, Base, and Blast managed to capture more interest from DeFi users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total value locked (TVL) on decentralized applications fell $10 billion in April, [according](https://defillama.com/?liquidstaking=true) to data aggregator DefiLlama. That’s a 7% drop in 30 days, as the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem closed last month with $138.6 billion, including liquid staked amounts.

![Image 1: DeFi’s total value locked falls $10 billion in April](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201809%20311'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

DeFi’s TVL variation in April. Image: DefiLlama

Considering the 10 largest blockchains by TVL, Avalanche registered the most significant monthly drop, with 31.5% of the funds leaving the chain. Solana also saw a considerable amount of crypto leaving its ecosystem as its TVL slump was almost 30%.

[![Image 2: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

Nevertheless, the over $6 billion locked in its applications makes Solana the third-largest blockchain in total value locked. Meanwhile, despite the 14.2% drop, Ethereum still dominates almost 69% of DeFi’s TVL.

Despite the outflow of locked funds seen in the decentralized ecosystem, Base and Bitcoin managed to attract more capital and surpass the $1 billion threshold. The Layer-2 blockchain created by crypto exchange Coinbase presented an 18.4% growth, led by Moonwell, Seamless Protocol, and Tarot applications.

Bitcoin was propelled by new L2 infrastructure, which boosted its TVL by almost 39% in a month. Moreover, the Bitcoin DeFi narrative is hyped by industry players, such as services provider Trust Machines. Mark Hendrickson, a member of Trust Machines’ team, shared with Crypto Briefing that Bitcoin has as many functionalities as other blockchains, and events such as Stacks’ Nakamoto upgrade will boost the DeFi narrative.

Blast, another layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum, showed a slight growth of 4.4% in April and closed the group of winners for the past 30 days.

**How to Buy Solana Memecoins**
-------------------------------

Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.

Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like [Raydium](https://beta.raydium.io/swap/) or [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-USDC).

This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Markdown Content:
**[Chainlink](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-chainlink/) (LINK) is currently facing bearish woes and could react to them by noting a price drop. This is essential for the altcoin to initiate a recovery that could help gain the losses noted recently.**

Investors are exhibiting short-term pessimism, which aligns with the predicted outcome for the LINK price.

Chainlink Investors Could Make a Move Soon
------------------------------------------

LINK price is anticipating a decline, and the network is not keen on changing the outcome. The recent correction eliminated any incentive for new investors to [jump aboard the Chainlink train](https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-ccip-expands-nine-blockchain/). This is evident in the network growth, which has dipped to a yearly low.

Network growth is calculated based on the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network. This data determines whether or not a project is losing traction in the market.

Given [Chainlink’s network growth](https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/) is so low, it seems probable that LINK is not attracting any new users at the moment. This could negatively impact the price of the token.

Secondly, LINK is highly undervalued at the moment, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This, however, is a bullish development. 

The MVRV ratio measures investor profit/loss. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV at -16% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation.

Historically, LINK price recovery occurs at -7% and -17% MVRV, labeling it an opportunity zone. Nevertheless, there is still some room before LINK investors purchase the token right now to initiate a recovery.

LINK Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch
------------------------------------------

LINK price, trading at $12.7 at the time of writing, is below the support of $13.2. This is a crucial level because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement.

Further [decline is likely should LINK fall below](https://beincrypto.com/link-price-breach-bearish-pattern/) the support at $12.7. Considering the market conditions, LINK will potentially drop to $11.7 before bouncing back up.

However, if the support at $12.7 remains intact and Chainlink reclaims 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement as support, [it could initiate a recovery](https://beincrypto.com/link-primed-for-recovery-next/). This would invalidate the bearish thesis and enable a rise to $14.8 and beyond.
