As expected, the FED left interest rates constant. In the statement published after the decision, it was stated that there have been deficiencies in reaching the 2% inflation target in the recent period.

Now, FED President Jerome Powell's press conference, which started at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3), is being followed closely.

As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are bringing you this conversation live. You can access Jerome Powell's latest remarks by refreshing the page. You can also find the official live broadcast link right below.

*   Inflation fell significantly last year but remains very high.
*   Further progress on inflation is not guaranteed; The path is unclear.
*   We are extremely careful about inflation risks.
*   The restrictive policy stance put downward pressure on inflation and the economy.
*   Risks to achieving bilateral goals have become better balanced in the past year.
*   The labor market remains relatively tight.
*   Nominal wage growth has decreased over the past year, but labor demand still exceeds supply.
*   This year's inflation data was higher than expected.
*   Our policy actions are guided by our goals.
*   FED officials are 'very aware' of the challenges posed by high inflation.
*   But long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
*   We do not think it would be appropriate to cut interest rates until we have greater confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
*   Gaining greater confidence is likely to take longer than previously expected.
*   Lowering policy too soon or too much, or too late or too little, both have risks.
*   Inflation data so far this year have not given us any more confidence.
*   Politics is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face.
*   We will make our decisions separately for each meeting.
*   The policy rate is at a restrictive level.
*   We believe it will be restrictive enough over time.
*   We believe that over time the policy is restrictive enough to reduce inflation to 2%.
*   The next policy move is unlikely to be a rate hike.
*   We are focused on how long to keep the policy restrictive.
*   To raise rates, we need to see evidence that the policy is not enough to bring inflation back to our target.
*   We think policy is well placed to consider the different paths the economy can take.
*   If inflation is more persistent and the labor market remains strong, it may be appropriate to postpone interest rate cuts.
*   But there are other avenues that point to a rate cut, but these would only come if we gain more confidence and there is an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
*   There is no obvious link between easing financial conditions and inflation.
*   I'm not ruling out that we could still have strong growth or that the labor market and inflation could continue to fall.
*   It is unlikely that the next move will be a rate hike.
*   To meet the inflation target, we will likely need to see wage growth slow to more sustainable levels.
*   I don't know how long it will take us to lower interest rates.
*   Powell: (when asked about 3 interest rate cuts this year) said only that the FED needs more confidence on inflation and does not see progress in Q1.
*   We need to take a cue from three worse-than-expected inflation data.
*   Once we gain confidence about inflation, interest rate cuts will be within scope.
*   The indication we are getting is that it will take longer to get on a sustainable path towards 2% inflation.
*   My expectation is that inflation will decline again this year.
*   My confidence that inflation will decline again is lower than before.
*   Question: Has the possibility of a rate cut decreased this year? Powell: I don't have a probability estimate. We need to be more confident, our confidence did not increase in the first quarter, on the contrary it will last longer than expected.
*   I don't know if inflation will drop enough to merit interest rate cuts.
*   I'm not sure whether there will be a rate cut this year or not.
*   In light of the data we have, I really don't understand where the talk of a stagflation scenario comes from.
*   I don't see stagflation related to growth or inflation.
*   3% inflation does not satisfy us.
*   Restrictive monetary policy needs more time to fulfill its duty.
*   We have peace of mind that we will do what we think is right, when we think it is right.
*   We've seen pretty consistent progress in slowing wage growth, but it's been bumpy.
*   It will take some time, but we will reduce inflation to 2%.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded modestly in the minutes since the news broke, but remains under pressure, falling more than 4% to $58,000 in 24 hours.

Markets entered 2024 expecting a long series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but those hopes have faded sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rose slightly in the first four months of the year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing the probability of a zero rate cut this year at around 25%. A month ago, the probability that the FED would not cut interest rates in 2024 was only 1%.

However, following the decision, many investors predict that the FED will make the only interest rate cut this year in November.

Venture capital is seeing a strong comeback in the gaming industry, with a surge in both funding and deal volume. 

[According](https://www.konvoy.vc/content/gaming-industry-report-q1-2024) to Konvoy Ventures, a venture capital firm specializing in the video gaming industry, the first quarter of 2024 saw $594 million in gaming VC funding, marking a 94% increase from the previous quarter. Deal volume also rose 28%, with 124 deals completed.

Konvoy predicts the gaming market is projected to reach $225 billion by 2029, from $189 billion in 2023.

The Web3 industry is also being driven by blockchain games. According to DappRadar, Web3 games accounted for 30% of all DApp activity in the first quarter of 2024, attracting 2.1 million active wallets every day. During the quarter, Polygon drew in over 1.1 million new wallets, an increase of 429% from the quarter before.

Venture capital firms are gearing up to keep pace with the bull cycle. In April, some of the VCs raising capital for funds included Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm and Pantera Capital.

Early crypto investor Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ has been [charged with a tax fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud), with the Department of Justice saying he evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.

In an indictment filed in federal court in Los Angeles, 45-year-old Ver is charged with mail fraud and tax evasion. The DOJ stated that the indictment was unsealed after his arrest in Spain over the weekend, and the U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.

Ver earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” due to his early investments in cryptocurrency and his [tendency to preach about it](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/02/meet-bitcoin-jesus-a-virtual-currency-millionaire.html). Born in California, Ver renounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.

According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350116/dl?inline), Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he owned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is alleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and evaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means Ver’s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.

Ver’s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange [Binance founder Changpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering,](https://qz.com/binance-founder-cz-money-laundering-1851446897) received a four-month jail sentence. Previously, [Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange](https://qz.com/sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentence-ftx-collapse-1851371007), was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Polygon (MATIC) inches close to 2024 low after 7% drop.

*   **Polygon (MATIC) has dived to near-yearly lows.**
*   **MATIC’s price action follows a broader market dip led by Bitcoin.**
*   **A critical U.S. macroeconomic data release expected today could be essential to MATIC’s short-term fate.**

[Polygon (MATIC)](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-second-layer-of-blockchain/) sees red.

After [a parabolic run in Q1 2024](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-matic-price-hits-12-month-high-in-bitcoin-led-rally/), crypto assets, including Polygon’s native token MATIC, are now experiencing a rout. A recent [Bitcoin](https://dailycoin.com/bitcoin-btc-birth-cryptocurrency-blockchain-revolution/)\-led market flush has sent MATIC near yearly lows amid this decline.

Polygon (MATIC) Dives Below $0.65
---------------------------------

Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has tanked about 7%, from around $0.6759 to lows of around $0.6322, near 2024 lows of $0.5885.

MATIC’s price rout is part of a broader market dump that has seen Bitcoin’s price drop by about $2,500 in the two hours from about $60,000 to just below $57,500. The jitters come as the market awaits the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision [slated for](https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar) 6:00 pm UTC, Wednesday, May 1. 

With the Fed expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like crypto.  

MATIC boasts support within the $0.6467 and $0.6314 price range. At the time of writing, the asset is already showing resilience, bouncing from $0.6322 to trade at $0.6653. Bulls would want this momentum to continue, as a break below the current support could see the asset tank as low as $0.5.

The Fed’s rate hike decision is critical to MATIC’s continued run in the short term. While leaving rates unchanged or raising rates could lead to mild or significant price corrections, a shock decision to engage in rate cuts could fuel a parabolic run to the upside. 

On the Flipside 
----------------

*   **MATIC is not the only asset that experienced a price drop in the Bitcoin-led correction. Leading assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana are also experiencing price corrections of about 3.2%, 2.8%, and 4%, respectively, per** [**_CoinGecko_** **data**](https://www.coingecko.com/) **at the time of writing.**

Why This Matters 
-----------------

The price action of the past 24 hours puts MATIC in a precautionary position. If it fails to hold support, the asset risks a 30% drop to $0.5.

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38561876/how-bitcoin-etfs-and-crypto-markets-ptsd-caused-scammy-memecoin-launches-alex-kr-ger

Markdown Content:
Economist and trader **Alex Krüger** shared thoughts on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, pointing out what, according to his interpretation, is driving the current price action and why the bull market is [not over yet](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38555886/this-trader-sees-bitcoin-dropping-to-40-000-and-still-be-fine-expect-lower-prices-but-dont).

**What Happened:** Krüger highlights **Bitcoin** BTC/USD ETF as the primary force behind the cycle, while **Ethereum** ETH/USD has been a “major disappointment” despite performing well for stakers and airdrop farmers.

He adds that **Solana** SOL/USD has established itself as the preferred chain for retail traders, demonstrating "perfect product-market fit" and even overtaking Ethereum. However, the network’s congestion and subsequent crashes have opened the door for competitors like Base to position themselves as viable alternatives for retail traders.

Noting the marginal new retail interest in crypto, Krüger states that most of the participants are ETF buyers and those from previous cycles redeploying their funds and taking on more risk. Those who missed the Bitcoin ETF run, crypto market participants with “PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” went all-in on altcoins. But those disappointed with significant losses, as numerous altcoins erased their 2024 gains in the past month.

**Why It Matters:** While many meme coins have gone to zero, Krüger writes they have dominated the narrative alongside Bitcoin as large-cap meme coins are among the strongest performers of the year. They have also established themselves as "a viable asset class in their own right."

He attributed the market's volatility to the increasing presence of scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders mainly since February. These founders prioritize short-term hype and quick profits over long-term sustainability.

Krüger maintains that the current crypto cycle “is not over” and there are still numerous opportunities for investors who navigate the market carefully and stay attuned to the evolving trends and narratives.

This analysis comes amid Bitcoin's huge price plunge of 5% in a single day pushing prices below the $58,000 mark.

**What’s Next**: The influence of [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment) is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19.

**Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing financial transactions linked to Block, a firm founded by Jack Dorsey, focusing on potential violations at its divisions, Cash App and Square.**

According to sources, this investigation stems from documents indicating that Block processed crypto transactions for terrorist organizations and Square handled transactions involving countries under US sanctions.

Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Scrutiny
----------------------------------

The Southern District of New York’s inquiry began after an ex-employee provided documents revealing that Square and Cash App failed to collect adequate information for risk assessment. The employee [claimed](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181) that despite being aware, Block did not report numerous transactions involving sanctioned countries to the government as required.

&gt; “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was awed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program,” the former employee said.

These allegations come at a time when Cash App boasts 56 million active accounts and processed transactions worth $248 billion last year alone. The platform is popular for its instant money transfer service and ability to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.

&gt; “Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations,” a Block spokesperson stated.

The potential fallout of this investigation could be significant for [Jack Dorsey’s Block](https://beincrypto.com/block-ceo-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-mining-system/) as it navigates regulatory challenges and seeks to maintain its reputation. This scrutiny coincides with the resignation of two key board members, intensifying the spotlight on Block’s governance and compliance practices.

*   **Roger Ver** **is arrested on** **allegations** **of** **tax** **evasion.**
*   **Some** **observers** **believe** **US** **authorities****’** **actions** **are unjustified.** 
*   **The incident has triggered** **debate** **on the** **morality** **of** **taxation****.**

[Roger Ver](https://dailycoin.com/?s=roger+ver) was an early adopter and evangelist of Bitcoin, amassing a vast fortune by believing in the digital currency at a time when most dismissed it as worthless “magical internet money.” 

Ver acquired St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship in 2014 and renounced his US citizenship shortly after. Although Ver thought he was free of US control, authorities arrested the Bitcoin Cash proponent over the weekend on mail fraud and tax evasion charges, stoking government overreach concerns.

DoJ Coming For Roger Ver
------------------------

Roger Ver was [arrested in Spain](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-jesus-arrested-spain-us-tax-evasion-charges-2024-04-30/) over the weekend on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking Ver’s extradition to the US to stand trial over the charges, particularly unpaid taxes totaling $48 million. Ver’s lawyer, Bryan Skarlatos, stated that his client had relied on tax professionals to report his Bitcoin holdings properly and always intended to comply with regulations.

The outstanding tax liabilities stem from Ver’s 2014 renunciation of his US citizenship. Under citizen renunciation, individuals are required to pay an exit tax, with assets held treated as being sold at fair market value and any subsequent gains subject to an “expatriation tax.” The DoJ alleged that Ver and two of his companies, MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com, held around 131,000 BTC at that time.

In this case, prosecutors claimed Ver provided misleading information to undervalue his companies’ Bitcoin holdings when preparing the expatriation filings. The indictment claimed that in November 2017, Ver took possession of 70,000 BTC from his companies and sold them for around $240 million but failed to pay taxes owed on those distributions.

The DoJ stated that although Ver was not a US citizen when cashing out the 70,000 BTC, he was still [legally required](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) to report distributions from his companies and pay taxes on the sale of the BTC.  

Given the spate of perceived attacks on the crypto industry by US authorities lately, some have labeled Ver’s arrest as an unjustified overreach on the part of the US government. 

Crypto Clampdown?
-----------------

Several observers labeled Ver’s arrest a massive overreach by the US government. Simply, Bitcoin host Nico tied this incident to the recent arrest of [Samourai Wallet devs](https://dailycoin.com/why-samourai-wallet-is-in-hot-water-with-doj/), stating that the two events equate to the government “sending a message” to the cryptocurrency community.

&gt; It’s not a coincidence that Roger Ver and the Samouri wallet devs got arrested around the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; They are sending a message.

Kurt Wuckert Jr., the founder of BSV miner Gorilla Pool, dived into a [philosophical point](https://twitter.com/kurtwuckertjr/status/1785413818425704750) on the morality of taxation itself, commenting that “Failure to bribe the government so they don’t put you in a cage is not a crime. Demanding the bribe is evil.” Likewise, podcaster [“Walker” stated](https://twitter.com/WalkerAmerica/status/1785394785840189729) that “The United States of America holds its citizens prisoner.”

Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson took a different view by [addressing the charges](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1785383884659773658) against Ver. Hoskinson noted that Ver’s two companies were US-based, meaning Ver still had a tax obligation to the US even though he had renounced his US citizenship. Nonetheless, Hoskinson hoped that the allegations against Ver would be proven false.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The** [**MemoryDealers.com** **URL**](http://memorydealers.com/) **diverts to a** **tweet** **from** **Ver** **expressing** **distrust** **of the** **US** **government****.** 
*   **Servicing the US national debt is expected to cost $531 billion in 2024, making it the fifth largest government spending program.**

Why This Matters
----------------

Some maintain that taxation is theft, but the reality is that tax is the price to pay for living in a civilized society. However, the timing of Ver’s arrest is somewhat puzzling, given that the allegations occurred nearly seven years ago.

Recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As reported by Bloomberg, several major US-listed Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.

Bloomberg data shows that funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) traded well below their NAV. ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds.

Experts offer explanations for this phenomenon. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs. These factors can lead to temporary discrepancies between market prices and NAV.

However, Bloomberg [underscores](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/bitcoin-btc-etfs-flash-signs-of-stress-as-discounts-reach-records?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2) that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses unique complexities for ETF investors compared to traditional asset classes. This same volatility also creates lucrative opportunities for authorized participants, the specialized traders responsible for maintaining price alignment between ETFs and their NAV.

Virtu Financial Inc. CEO Douglas A. Cifu, as reported by Bloomberg, highlights these volatility-driven opportunities as a reason for continued optimism in crypto ETFs, despite the recent discounts.

The current macroeconomic climate, with the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, adds further pressure to the crypto market. As Bloomberg notes, speculative assets like Bitcoin often struggle in such environments.

WallachBeth Capital’s ETF director Mohit Bajaj suggests that the observed discounts could persist depending on Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

Runes have been taking over the **Bitcoin** BTC/USD network. This new token standard that launched with the latest Bitcoin halving has been mentioned before in this newsletter, in the context of pushing the average transaction fee on Bitcoin upwards even before their debut as hype stirred and helping miners combat a lower block subsidy reward as transaction fee revenue reached new highs. And both of those trends largely still hold.

URL Source: https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/federal-prosecutors-in-the-u-s-investigate-another-cryptocurrency-company-this-time-targeting-a-surprising-name/

Markdown Content:
Federal prosecutors are currently investigating financial transactions at Block, the cryptocurrency company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. The investigation focuses on alleged compliance deficiencies at the company's two main units, Square and Cash App.

A former employee provided documents to prosecutors for the Southern District of New York that purported to show that insufficient information was collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risk. The documents also allege that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and that Block processed numerous cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.

Many of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not properly reported to the government. The former employee alleges that Block failed to correct company processes when alerted to these violations.

The nearly 100-page document provided to NBC News identified transactions, mostly in low-dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, until last year.

“Everything in the compliance department was flawed from top to bottom. It's run by people who shouldn't be responsible for a regulated compliance program,” the former employee told NBC News. This assessment was echoed by a second person with direct knowledge of Block's monitoring programs and practices.

“My understanding from the documents is that the deficiencies in compliance were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years,” said Edward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who represented the former employee.

In response to the inquiry, a Block spokesperson said:

&gt; “Block has a responsible and comprehensive compliance program, and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and the evolving sanctions regulatory landscape. Our compliance program includes systems, tools and processes for sanctions screening, as well as the investigation and reporting of sanctions matters in accordance with our legal obligations.” “Continuously improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block, and we are committed to improving this work as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

*   **Hong Bitcoin ETFs have recently gone live for sale.** 
*   **The investment vehicle’s debut failed to meet market expectations.**
*   **Bitcoin ETF analysts have weighed in on the asset’s first-day performance.**

The record-breaking success of [Bitcoin ETFs](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-spot-bitcoin-etf-why-is-it-important/) upon launch in the United States has sparked a global interest in the asset class. Recently launched in Hong Kong, the promise of even broader adoption has driven excitement for the launched asset, heightening hopes for impressive inflows.

However, contrary to expectations, the debut of the exchange-traded funds has not gone off to a good start.

The newly launched asset class raked in a total of $141 million on its first day of trade, Tuesday, April 20, raising questions of performance among experts. Led by issuer ChinaAMC with $123 million, the cumulative volume contrasts sharply with the forecasted $300 million before launch, falling significantly behind the U.S. record of $4.6 billion.

Weighing in on the performance, analyst James Seyffart opined that the six Hong Kong spot ETFs did not _“live up to expectations_,” significantly underperforming below the record standards set by their U.S. counterparts.

&gt; To be clear. By any reasonable \*relative\* measure for the launch of these ETFs — they were a massive success for the HK market

ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also [reiterated](https://x.com/ericbalchunas/status/1785324704179368374?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) a previous warning against the overhype of the newly launched asset. Factoring the market size, Balchunas emphasized that the Hong Kong market is relatively smaller compared to the US and should not be equated similarly.

However, both Seyffart and Balchunas added that the performance was significant within the local market context. They stated that ChinaAMC’s performance positions it as the 6th most successful out of 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years and in the top 20% overall in terms of launches.

The underperformance of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch has rippled through the crypto market with a downward wave.

Crypto Market Hit as Bitcoin Retraces to $50K Mark
--------------------------------------------------

Leading the major market negative shift on April 30, [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-spot-bitcoin-etf-why-is-it-important/) suffered a sharp fall below the $60,000 mark for the first time this week, dropping to the $56,000 point.

This marked a sharp 12.5% decline in the token’s price, worsening ITS week-long downward trend. [Currently trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) at $56,980, BTC is down 29.4% from its all-time high of $73,738, squashing the once-heightened optimism for an imminent bull run. 

Bitcoin was not the only asset hit. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also took major hits, falling 29.7% and 17%, respectively. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX) experienced losses within the 6% range before rebounding later with modest gains.

On Wednesday, Bitcoin sharply declined, dropping below the [crucial $60,000 support level](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-prediction-to-42000/#:~:text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20outlined,continuation%20of%20BTC's%20bull%20run.). Despite this recent market downtrend, Bitcoin investors remain confident as they believe the flagship crypto can still reach [new heights](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) in this market cycle. Some say this might be what Bitcoin needs before making another parabolic run to the upside. 

Bitcoin’s Decline Is Nothing To Be Scared Of
--------------------------------------------

Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, reassured in an X (formerly Twitter) [post](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) that Bitcoin’s recent price decline was not unusual, stating it was “pretty ordinary stuff.” He also pointed out that this was Bitcoin’s [fourth 20% correction](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/) in the past 12 months, underscoring how normal these price movements are.

Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, had [previously warned](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/) that price declines of such magnitude were to be expected, stating that “bull markets are not straight lines up.” He noted that the same thing happened in the [2021 and 2017 bull runs](https://bitcoinist.com/rewards-2021-bitcoin-bull-buyers-finally-break-even/) when Bitcoin experienced about 13 price drawdowns of over 10% or more. 

Meanwhile, [crypto analyst Rekt Capital](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-troubles-far-from-over/) claimed in an [X post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785370455706063233) that “this is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle.” He added, “The longer this goes on, the better.” In another [X post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785371953940791680), he reassured his followers that Bitcoin is getting closer to its final bottom with each passing day. 

[![Image 4: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112492)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368656&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697925&amp;banID=521829427&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287438&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714595822763705&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-drop-below-60000-btc%2F&amp;hc=baea3d07dab2154976dab9968bb2a237afa8b531&amp;location=)

Like Rekt Capital, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also sounded confident that Bitcoin’s recent decline was just a part of the bigger picture for its move to the upside. They claimed this would be the “final shakeout before up, only rally to a cycle top.”

Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of Apollo, also shared his bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, as he suggested that the crypto token’s volatility is what makes it a great investment. “Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet. Bitcoin is still the best asymmetric opportunity in the market,” he [wrote](https://x.com/thomas_fahrer/status/1785450839815147634) on X. 

Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over
---------------------------------

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez [suggested](https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1785239938381873522) that Bitcoin’s bull run was far from over while comparing Bitcoin’s current price action to the last two [halving events](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/). According to him, Bitcoin consolidated for 189 and 87 days around the halving in 2016 and 2020, respectively, before the bull run resumed. 

[![Image 5: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374570&amp;setID=452519&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293220&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714595822996613&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-drop-below-60000-btc%2F&amp;hc=9915f0c827afd6987d36e7a232b77e30ac94ea01&amp;location=)

He further noted that Bitcoin has only consolidated for 60 days this time around, meaning that the flagship crypto will continue its run eventually. In a subsequent [X post](https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1785322627696857234), the analyst stated that Bitcoin might be 538 days away from hitting its [next market top](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) if it follows its trend from the previous two bull runs.

Before now, Martinez [mentioned](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/59800-important-level-bitcoin/#:~:text=Martinez%20mentioned%20in%20an%20X,drop%20to%20that%20price%20level.) that Bitcoin could rise to a [new all-time high](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,600, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to [data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) from CoinMarketCap.

In a momentous event that heralds a new era for Polkadot, Kusama, its test network, sold all three cores in its first Agile Coretime sale, as reported on April 30. This achievement, shared by Parity Technologies, the developer of the interoperable blockchain, is a crucial step in their roadmap towards bringing Agile Coretime to the mainnet.

Kusama Sells All Three Cores: Beggining Of A New Era?
-----------------------------------------------------

In an [update](https://twitter.com/paritytech/status/1785634827468779739) on X, all three cores were sold on April 30, generating 70 KSM, worth approximately $1,980. Each core was sold for 23.4 KSM, or roughly $660. Buyers of each core can now produce blocks on Kusama for the next four weeks.

The [Agile Coretime](https://www.parity.io/blog/agilecoretime-explained) concept, a replacement for the parachain auction system, is a welcomed change, especially for participants eager to produce blocks or deploy protocols. In this model, participants can bid for core time, a system that promises more efficiency, as envisioned by Gavin Wood, the developer of Polkadot and Kusama. 

The goal is to accelerate the pace at which new decentralized applications (dapps) can join the network. This will also help amplify enterprise adoption of Polkadot solutions.

The Agile Coretime concept eventually replaces the previous parachain auction system, bringing a host of benefits. For instance, it eliminates the need for upfront, long-term slot commitments, as with [Parachains](https://bitcoinist.com/how-polkadots-interoperable-system-is-created-through-parachains/).

This will, in turn, help foster more flexible resource utilization, particularly for new projects. Most importantly, this model creates opportunities for early-stage ventures and individual developers to participate.

It remains to be seen when this model will go live on Polkadot. However, early success in Kusama sets the pace for the eventual integration in the coming months.

Polkadot Prepares For Asynchronous Backing, DOT Rejects Bears
-------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond this, Polkadot plans to [activate](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing) Asynchronous Backing on the mainnet in the coming weeks, an update that enables the network to process more transactions, pushing up the overall throughput. Additionally, it allows for increased block capacity and shorter block times, changes that are a net positive for the network.

With this announcement, DOT prices are stable, cementing its position in the top-20. At press time, the coin changes hands at around $6.5, rejecting bears. Notably, DOT is finding support at April 2024 lows.

Still, for bulls to take over, prices must ease past $7.5, reversing losses of April 13. This development might anchor bulls who are currently targeting March 2024 highs.

Two United States lawmakers have introduced a bill to clarify how Bitcoin[](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price) [BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)

[![Image 2: tickers down](https://cointelegraph.com/assets/img/tickers/tickers_down.svg)](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)

and crypto miners are taxed over block rewards.

In an April 30 announcement, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel [said](https://ferguson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4656) they had introduced the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed legislation would specify that staking rewards would be considered created property under U.S. tax code, and taxes on block rewards would be collected at acquisition.

“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry,” said Representative Ferguson. “The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas.”

_Source: [Representative Wiley Nickel](https://twitter.com/RepWileyNickel/status/1785339771096588735)_

Crypto advocacy group Coin Center [described](https://www.coincenter.org/new-legislation-proposes-clear-tax-guidelines-for-crypto-block-rewards/) the bill as having “sensible policies” by taxing block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks when sold or spent rather than when they were acquired. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, [called](https://twitter.com/sheila_warren/status/1785476666367811998) the legislation “right on point” for providing needed guidance.

“\[B\]lock rewards are more appropriately classified as value creation due to a user’s actions and efforts, rather than income from an employer,” said Coin Center. “This simple policy would resolve major issues with how cryptocurrencies are taxed today and put the technology on a level playing field.” **_Related:_** [**_Solo Bitcoin miner wins the 3.125 BTC lottery, solving valid block_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solo-bitcoin-miner-solves-valid-block-post-halving)

The legislation came roughly 10 days after Bitcoin miner rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block [after the blockchain’s fourth halving](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-completion-confirmed) event. Halvings have historically decreased the new supply of the cryptocurrency and eventually caused the price to surge. At the time of publication, the BTC price was $58,030, having fallen roughly 11% since the halving on April 19.

[![Image 1](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trigger-Continuation-of-Bitcoin.jpg?w=750&amp;h=375&amp;crop=1)](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trigger-Continuation-of-Bitcoin.jpg)

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is reportedly raising her price target for Bitcoin ([BTC](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) based upon an assumption of greater institutional investment in the top digital asset by market cap.

According to a new report from Benzinga, Wood’s latest [prediction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-raises-her-bitcoin-141913532.html) is that Bitcoin will soar to $3.8 million by 2030 if institutions decide to allocate slightly more than 5% of their portfolios to BTC.

The new Wood prediction, made at a New York Investor Day in March, increases her previous prediction by $2.3 million.

Says Wood,

_“Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC \[US Securities and Exchange Commission\] has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.”_ Wood is referring to the SEC approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes one operated by ARK. The ETFs, which launched in January, have attracted tens of billions of dollars in investment and are seen as the most successful launches of an ETF. The ETFs allow institutions to access Bitcoin. If Wood’s prediction turns out to be accurate, it would mean that Bitcoin would increase from its current value by more than 6,572% in about six years. Bitcoin is trading for $56,946 at time of writing, down more than 6% in the last 24 hours. ![Image 2: a pink and green screen with the words daily hold get scoop alerts](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Get-Alerts-728x90.png)

URL Source: https://www.bankless.com/delegating-restaked-eth-on-eigenlayer

Markdown Content:
EigenLayer is on everyone's minds this week due to announcements around the much-hyped token launch. But amid all of the EIGEN talk, let's take a look at how to get started putting your restaked ETH to work!

In the [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) ecosystem, an **Actively Validated Service** (AVS) is a project that uses the security of Ethereum via EigenLayer to underpin its native functionalities.  

AVSs can be anything from data availability solutions to L2s, like optimistic or zk-rollups, and plenty more in between. 

“Operators” are the entities responsible for running these services. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the AVSs by managing the underlying nodes and operations.

Notably, AVSs expand the capabilities of Ethereum by providing scalable and efficient solutions for various blockchain applications. Operators ensure these services are reliable and secure, making them integral to the trust and functionality of the AVSs they support.

**The First AVSs on EigenLayer**
--------------------------------

![Image 1](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/JOqvtVW4R7RXyNo4oiMqq5RAiqHxd_sYqeRBLsZBkzm1kXbVUbQPkRpkUJmhK6WOAe4FhCVInnY6rdvQxNj0REj2c-mGv5UJdhlBHNV1qHaS_9a0-ql5-wO22V_7qgJaol_h-h19Cls8ODgnG9pUAGc)

In April 2024, EigenLayer started its phased rollout of the first AVSs, beginning with its own EigenDA solution. After that, [eight more services have come online](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/avs-launch/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) atop the restaking protocol. Five of the most active AVSs so far have been:

1.  [**EigenDA**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x870679e138bcdf293b7ff14dd44b70fc97e12fc0?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — A new data availability network, EigenDA boasts high throughput and low costs, ideal for scaling Ethereum's data handling capacities. _Current TVL: 2.71M ETH_
2.  [**eoracle**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x23221c5bb90c7c57ecc1e75513e2e4257673f0ef?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — A decentralized oracle network that securely integrates real-world data into Ethereum, powering various decentralized apps. _Current TVL: 1.87M ETH_
3.  [**Witness Chain**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xd25c2c5802198cb8541987b73a8db4c9bcae5cc7?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — Coordinates decentralized physical infrastructure networks, offering a new layer of economic activities for blockchain projects. _Current TVL: 1.82M ETH_
4.  [**Brevis coChain AVS**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x9fc952bdcbb7daca7d420fa55b942405b073a89d?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — This service uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable smart contracts to access and compute vast historical blockchain data efficiently. _Current TVL: 1.30M ETH_
5.  [**AltLayer MACH**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x71a77037870169d47aad6c2c9360861a4c0df2bf?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — Focused on providing fast finality for transactions within rollups, enhancing the speed and reliability of Ethereum-based transactions. _Current TVL: 1.29M ETH_

**Choosing an AVS and Operator**
--------------------------------

When selecting an AVS and an operator, make sure you first understand the specific services and benefits each offers. 

For example, [EigenYields](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x5accc90436492f24e6af278569691e2c942a676d?ref=bankless.ghost.io) is one of the operators of EigenDA, and it promises to share airdrops with its delegators. While direct incentives around AVSs are scant for now, look for operators to offer more explicit rewards like this going forward. 

![Image 2](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lJd-DABW6wTswRDZvPc2gY1TyYj15wxL8D2e0LpMeSkdYojLUwSR7DPIRweyZ4uBsdvQAlO2Yg8cJeRnkahDOJ3N2IUeLtlULsEo85wC8nLUNnjS2PCaaJkdy8A2YrVegbPZ-F3CkzEjoQ33DrXKAo0)

While EigenLayer vetted its first wave of AVSs, the ecosystem is moving towards a permissionless model where operators will self-register. This means assessing the risk and potential of each operator will become increasingly important over time. 

Additionally, EigenLayer does not guarantee the fitness of any operators, and bad operators can cause slashing events for their delegators once this functionality is activated later, so performing due diligence before delegating is crucial. It also takes seven days to redelegate to another operator, so make sure you’re confident before diving in. 

**How to Delegate Restaked ETH to AVS Operators**
-------------------------------------------------

![Image 3](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/R2Z8AuGxB5PgN8NcMlynePc0zxmRopmjTvVMjopqhQOhnA6EU-PWm9Cb5vbCEVMck3woDOKthaSUlCg33_NEegTDBrWYfeuZ0HUsnmfAn-uxWFNxcYg0E2xONQ7GpXMZL4UD7nt7jhLp0VaRz-5g8A4)

1.  **Access the EigenLayer AVS Dashboard** — Navigate to [the AVS dashboard](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs?ref=bankless.ghost.io) and connect your wallet.
2.  **Select an AVS** — Review the available AVSs and select one that aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
3.  **Choose an Operator** — Each AVS has a list of operators you can click into. Select an operator based on their performance and any additional incentives they might offer.
4.  **Delegate Your Stake** — Click the "Delegate" button next to your chosen operator. You'll be prompted to confirm the delegation with your wallet. 

**That’s it, that’s all it takes to get started here!** Now just sit back while your restaked ETH is put to work. Again, remember that you can redelegate to a different operator as you please, but the process will take seven days. 

Also, be sure to stay tuned to [EigenLayer’s social accounts](https://twitter.com/eigenlayer?ref=bankless.ghost.io) about new AVSs coming online, as they may offer new opportunities or require adjustments in your delegation strategy!

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/vitalik-buterin-zk-proofs-more-efficient

Markdown Content:
Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a new blog post discussing a new cryptographic proving system that can make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient.

The proving system, called Binius, is designed to operate directly over binary code on computers. Binary code is a language understood by computers, and it is used to store information and represents data using the symbols zero and one, otherwise known as bits. 

Although there are some similarities between STARKs and Binius, Buterin explains that the mathematical tricks that enable these different proving systems are very different. 

Generally speaking, STARKs is a technology that has enabled complicated statements to be easily cryptographically verified. It is designed in a way that can easily compute numbers when they are of small value, when there are large values, STARKs generate extra values, which can lead to inefficiency. 

Unlike STARKs that “arithmetize” a statement into a polynomial equation — a mathematical expression which model a relationship between variables in a block — Binius treats data as a hypercube and grid, and uses multilinear polynomials to perform cryptographic proofs.

Loading Tweet..

Binius converts individual values into bits and places them in a hypercube and a square. This hypercube is then converted into a grid and computations are performed in order to receive an output matrix. 

![Image 1](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png)

A verifier will then perform its own computational calculations to ensure that the information itself matches and ensure that the compute columns returns a value claimed by the prover.

“I highly encourage people to understand and explore! Lots of innovations have been happening in ZK-proving recently. And I expect lots more to come soon,” Buterin wrote in an [X post](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1784912152655974533).

![Image 1: a pile of one dollar bills on a white background](https://media.cryptoglobe.com/2022/09/zoomed-in-one-dollar-bill-768x576.jpg) 

According to a recent [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/business/a-strong-us-dollar-weighs-on-the-world.html) by Joe Rennison and Karl Russell for The New York Times (NYT), the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength against nearly every major currency in the world this year. The Times reports that two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, largely due to expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

The article explains that high Fed rates, a response to persistent inflation, have made American assets more attractive to investors worldwide. As a result, money has been flowing into the United States, creating ripple effects felt by policymakers, politicians, and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo.

The Times highlights the far-reaching consequences of a strong dollar, including intensified inflation abroad, higher interest bills for countries that have borrowed in dollars, and potential benefits for foreign businesses exporting to the U.S. However, the article also notes that American companies selling abroad may be put at a disadvantage, potentially widening the U.S. trade deficit.

The impact of the dollar’s strength, as reported by The New York Times, depends on the underlying reasons for high U.S. interest rates. If rates remain elevated due to stubborn inflation despite slowing economic growth, policymakers worldwide may face a difficult choice between supporting their domestic economies or bolstering their currencies.

The article emphasizes that Asia has been particularly affected by the strong dollar, with the Japanese yen and Korean won reaching multi-year lows. The Times also points out that China has allowed the yuan to weaken, raising questions about the strength of its economy.

Per the NYT article, European policymakers are considering cutting rates but must be mindful of the potential impact on the euro’s value relative to the dollar. The article also notes that central banks in South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia are grappling with similar challenges.

URL Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-signs-hint-that-bitcoin-price-is-nearing-a-bottom

Published Time: 2024-05-01T19:45:46.000Z

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin price crashed between April 30 and May 1, with its price decreasing by 11.5% to $56,522. This downturn triggered $172 million in leveraged long position liquidations, which is notably low given that Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) futures open interest was at $28.9 billion before the price crash. Consequently, it would be simplistic to assume that bulls were taken by surprise.

Uncertainty should drop after the Fed minutes publish
-----------------------------------------------------

Some analysts believe that investors are in a holding pattern until Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, concludes his speech following the two-day monetary council meeting on May 1. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will maintain interest rates at 5.25%, there is considerable skepticism regarding the U.S. Treasury Department’s ability to finance the government’s budget.

On April 30, the yield on the U.S. Treasury two-year note climbed to its highest level in five months, reaching 5.06%, as investors sought higher returns to offset increased risk following the announcement of a $1.07 trillion deficit for the first half of 2024. Since the Fed’s rate hikes throughout 2023, interest expenses on the deficit have risen by 23% in the first half of 2024 and are projected to continue to rise as long as rates remain elevated.

Bitcoin is not alone in facing declines: Worsening macroeconomic conditions have made investors more risk-averse. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks mid- and small-cap U.S.-listed companies, fell by 8.2% over the last 30 days, wiping out gains from the previous two months. Similarly, WTI oil prices have dropped 8.3% since April 5, when they reached a five-month peak of $87.91.

A key indication that Bitcoin’s price correction may be reaching a bottom stems from the traditional markets, following a series of robust first-quarter corporate earnings reports from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, TSMC, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays. A temporary recovery in the stock market shifts investor focus away from Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, although traders may seek alternatives if the Fed decides to maintain higher rates for an extended period.

Bitcoin miner capitulation FUD and strong crypto influx in China
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin miners are under significant strain after the April 20 halving, which reduced their rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC per block. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, mentioned that estimates of miners’ outflows to exchanges show [no signs of capitulation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-signs-bitcoin-miner-capitulation-despite-plummeting-revenue-cryptoquant) “for now.” Young Ju added that if the Bitcoin price downtrend “stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of Bitcoin.”

Thus, another sign that Bitcoin’s downturn may be nearing its end is the steadfastness of miners, which remain reluctant to sell despite a 57% drop in the Hashrate Index, as [reported](https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index) by Luxor Technology. This metric assesses the daily expected return of one terahash of hashing power, factoring in network difficulty, Bitcoin’s price and transaction fees.

To understand the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, examining the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)), can be enlightening. The premium on USDC transactions over the official U.S. dollar rate offers insight into retail investors’ activities, indicating whether they are moving into or out of cryptocurrency markets.

On May 1, the premium for USDC in China increased to 2.7%, signifying a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. This sustained interest points to a positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in China, bolstering an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, which recently saw a 20% decline in price over three weeks.

However, despite potential improvements in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s notes and the realization that fears of miner capitulation are, thus far, unfounded, the situation in U.S. markets shows a different trend. Specifically, net outflows from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million in the past five trading days.

Such findings suggest that investment flows are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price movements, with no certainty that the $56,500 support level will hold.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/developer-awarded-250k-by-curve-finance/

Markdown Content:
Cryptocurrency and [DeFi](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/) protocols have faced increasing problems due to vulnerabilities and resultant loss of funds. As the problems have continued, those identifying it have contributed to the benefit of the cause of decentralized finance. In a big discovery, a cybersecurity expert identified a vulnerability in Curve Finance protocol which could be used for withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

Cryptocurrency protocols and vulnerability 
-------------------------------------------

There has been an estimate of losses [amounting to $758 million](https://de.fi/blog/de-fi-rekt-report-over-758m-lost-in-q3-2023) due to vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols in Q3 of 2023. There have been a staggering 116 cases which show that there is an urgent need for enhancement of security. A workforce needs to be deployed for this purpose to identify vulnerabilities and address problems. 

In a recent discovery, Curve Finance protocol has identified a vulnerability in the DeFi system. The vulnerability is of historical importance as it has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for years. The vulnerability has resulted in hackers’ access to the protocol’s liquidity pool and drawing out funds. 

There have been a range of security attacks in 2023 and major areas of focus for hackers included smart contract vulnerabilities, reentry attacks, and Oracle manipulation attacks. The first one is of critical importance because if a hacker is able to identify a vulnerability, they can use it for negative purposes, affecting the funds and security of the protocol.  

Claim of a key vulnerability in [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/) and other protocols came from a cybersecurity expert Marc Croc. Belonging to Kupia security, Marc Croc said that the vulnerability resulted in the loss of funds from the liquidity pool. The mentioned cybersecurity expert also added that it has led to the loss of millions from various protocols. 

Reentrancy Vulnerability in Curve Finance
-----------------------------------------

Reenetracy vulnerability was verified by the developers’ team from [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/). In a detailed overview, they were able to identify and confirm it. According to official sources, the bug could manipulate the balances of a DeFi protocol. The manipulation of balances could also result in the withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

&gt; Big thanks for the disclosure! Grieving attacks are not as dangerous (funds would be anyway recoverable, and no profit for attacker) – could have caused serious panic if happened.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an example of a very professional work
&gt; 
&gt; — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1785406648082997532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

According to Curve Protocol sources, the bug didn’t pose an existential threat but it could create panic if any such incident took place. Furthermore, the company believed that they could recover funds in case such an incident took place. In July Curve Finance was able to recover funds amounting to $62 million which had been stolen after a vulnerability was exposed to hackers. 

Furthermore, the protocol members agreed to return assets valuing $49.2 million to liquidity providers. It announced the recovery of ETH assets, CRV, and other assets that were recovered by whitehat hackers. 

Curve protocol has brought forward a proposal the community fund will supply CRV tokens. The attackers identified a vulnerability in the Vyper language where problems were found in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0.

Developer rewarded $250K
------------------------

It was a critical problem that would have created problems for the development team because of the increased panic amongst the users and investors. To face the problem promptly, a cybersecurity expert identified the problem, not revealing their identity. 

&gt; 🐞I reported a vulnerability in [@CurveFinance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and I am thrilled to share that I've been awarded a bug bounty of $250,000. 🧵
&gt; 
&gt; — Marco Croc (@malicator) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Once the problem was confirmed, the protocol awarded the whitehat maximum bug bounty of $250K. The whitehat shared the details in the X thread, thanking Curve Finance. Furthermore, the account shared the details of how the vulnerability would affect the protocol. 

Conclusion
----------

In a recent tweet from a whitehat cybersecurity expert, Marc Croc announced the discovery of a vulnerability in Curve Finance. The development team confirmed and addressed the problem, announcing a bounty amount of $250K for the mentioned whitehat. Though the problem wasn’t an existential threat, it would have created a panic.

Markdown Content:
Just a few months ago, most economists expected the Federal Reserve to kick start rate cuts by May. All signs pointed to this: the fight against inflation appeared to be coming to an end, jobs data promised a cooling labor market on the horizon, and consumer confidence began to falter. 

Fast forward to May’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and the hopes of a rate cut in the first half of 2024 are quickly diminishing. Indeed, it appears likely the Fed will hold rates where they are for much longer than anyone could have imagined back in January. Some market commentators even think we're stuck with “higher for longer” until 2025, despite the pressure of an imminent presidential election.

Whether rates stay put until September or next January, the May FOMC meeting was certainly a far cry from December 2023, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell first mentioned rate cuts, sending markets into a frenzy. Now, we're seeing a much more hawkish committee, resolute in its restrictive monetary policy stance in the face of stubborn inflation and a labor market that refuses to stumble.

**_Related:_** [**_The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halving_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/runes-protocol-ignite-new-season-bitcoin-after-halving)

But while disappointing for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, the Fed's stance shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who follows economic data. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — [the PCE index](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-trades-deep-discount-after-halving-5-things-bitcoin-this-week) — rose to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in February. The CPI index has remained similarly sticky, rising again from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March.

This has been fuelled by rampant spending, with consumers preferring to take on more debt rather than tighten their belts. In fact, the savings rate in the U.S. has continuously declined from 4.1% in January to just 3.2% in March, while household debt levels keep beating previous records. On top of this, unemployment has failed to edge higher. The jobless rate fell from 3.9% in February to 3.8% in March, hovering around historic lows.

![Image 1: walter bloomberg tweets that he doesn't know how long it will take before he's cut off](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/c00c6ddf-1617-4ad9-96f2-386a44b0c486.jpg)

So, even though the economy is beginning to slow — first-quarter GDP growth surprised on the downside, coming in at 1.6% against expectations of 2.4% - we're still a long way from the economic slowdown that would warrant stimulus in the form of rate cuts. Indeed, Powell has always been clear that the Fed's monetary policy decisions will be driven by data, and data alone. And the data simply doesn't support a looser stance, yet.

As expected, the markets have been taking this disappointment badly. Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) was hovered between $60,000 and $65,000 in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting, and global stock markets were subdued as expectations of a hawkish pivot mounted. Conversely, the dollar strengthened, battering other global currencies like the yen, which fell to the lowest level against the dollar since 1990. Other emerging market currencies can be expected to follow.

![Image 2: a black screen with the words'powerful unlucky that move will be like'](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/4a6465be-0133-4667-ae94-0efaf1e0091d.jpg)

_Jerome Powell said it was "unlikely" the Fed's next move would be a rate hike. Source: X_

And the bad news is that we're likely stuck with this picture for a good few months. This will be a real anticlimax for those who expected the Bitcoin halving to drive a bullish breakout to a new all-time high. After some rampant price action over recent months, no one is ready for another extended period of sideways trading. It’s akin to the lights going on at the nightclub when the party is just getting started.

**_Related:_** [**_Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchains_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-illustrates-dark-side-monolithic-blockchains)

As long as the Fed holds rates steady, though, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a tight range — below $70,000 — barring any major global disasters causing a flight to safety. So far this year, Bitcoin hasn’t really cared about macroeconomics — it shrugged off the last few inflation announcements. But the Fed’s stance will have a more profound effect. The reality is that BTC is now deeply embedded in traditional financial markets thanks to spot ETFs, so it will most likely mimic the behavior of other risk assets until rates begin coming down.

So, thanks to Jerome Powell, we’re in for a boring summer that will truly test investors’ patience. That's not to say there won't be another Bitcoin party — it's coming, and it will likely rival or perhaps even surpass what we've already seen this year. Over the longer term, the Bitcoin investment thesis remains intact. Indeed, while Powell's renewed hawkishness is buoying the U.S. dollar for now, it's only a matter of time until the Fed finally pulls the plug, causing renewed dollar weakness.

Once the greenback begins its slide, Bitcoin will provide refuge from currency devaluation. Then, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs will truly come into their own, and those who can hold on to their assets and wait out the drought will be rewarded. Until then, perhaps it's not such a bad idea to leave investment portfolios alone and go enjoy the summer.

*   **Tether reports a Q1 net profit of $4.52 billion.**
*   **Gains come from treasury holdings and Bitcoin and Gold.**
*   **Treasuries enable Tether to make substantial profits.** 

Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of [USDT](https://dailycoin.com/stablecoins/tether-usdt/), the biggest stablecoin in the world, had often [found itself in controversy](https://dailycoin.com/tether-usdt-a-giant-with-feet-of-clay/). These largely stemmed from the transparency of its reserves, which often came under question. 

Since then, Tether has started to take transparency more seriously. Its latest report breaks down the company’s assets, including its significant profits. 

On Wednesday, May 1, Tether Holdings Limited released its [financial report](https://t.co/K7eFBQ6aAQ) for the first quarter of 2024, showing a record net profit of $4.52 billion. According to the attestation by the accounting firm BDO, the largest share, $1 billion, came from US Treasuries. 

The remainder came from the increase in the value of Bitcoin and gold, which Tether owns in large quantities. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price was $42,280 and has since shot up significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $57,329. Moreover, gold has significantly increased over the same period, going from $2070 per ounce to $2300.

Tether’s considerable Bitcoin and gold holdings contributed substantially to its profits. According to the attestation, Tether’s total reserves are $115.41 billion, with the largest portion, $90.87 billion, in U.S. Treasuries. 

Why Tether Holds So Much Bonds
------------------------------

Tether’s bonds offer a liquid asset that is easily convertible to cash, enabling the company to meet eventual withdrawal demands. However, unlike cash reserves, US Treasury bonds provide a return on investment. This means Tether can profitably from them while exposing itself to relatively little risk.  

In addition to bonds, Tether holds $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents. These are highly liquid assets that fulfill immediate redemption requirements. 

In addition to treasury bonds and cash, Tether also holds $5.37 billion in Bitcoin and $3.65 billion in Gold. Notably, Tether issues a gold-backed stablecoin, which explains its substantial gold holdings. 

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **Despite Tether’s reports,** [**questions**](https://dailycoin.com/tethers-usdt-approaches-historic-ath-market-cap-milestone/) **about its reserve transparency still persist among the crypto community.** 
*   **Tether has recently been expanding** [**beyond stablecoins**](https://dailycoin.com/whats-behind-tethers-expansive-vision-beyond-stablecoins/)**, including into venture capital, big data, and AI.** 

Why This Matters
----------------

Tether’s recent financial outcomes and the management of its reserves have broad implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting perceptions of USDT’s stability and reliability.

Markdown Content:
According to a [report](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-nyc-hush-money-trial-resume-with-bankers-testimony-2024-04-30/) by Reuters, Judge Juan Merchan has fined former U.S. President Donald Trump $9,000 for contempt of court during his ongoing criminal hush money trial, warning that incarceration could follow if Trump continues to breach the gag order. The fine, issued on Tuesday, was for Trump’s violation of the gag order, which restricts him from making public comments about trial witnesses and participants. Trump was penalized $1,000 for each of nine comments he made online that the judge found in violation of this order.

Justice Merchan, overseeing the trial, expressed concerns that the fine might not sufficiently deter Trump, given his substantial wealth, and noted his own limitations in imposing a higher penalty. The judge emphasized the necessity of upholding the integrity of the court’s orders and indicated a willingness to consider jail as a further measure if Trump persists in his violations.

The cited comments included an article shared by Trump labeling his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness in the trial, as a “serial liar.” Another contentious post cited a claim about “undercover liberal activists” attempting to infiltrate the jury. Merchan dismissed Trump’s defense that he should not be held accountable for content he reposted but did not originally write.

A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Thursday, where additional penalties for other statements may be discussed. Merchan also demanded the removal of the offending posts from Trump’s Truth Social platform and his campaign website.

In a response on Truth Social, Trump decried the actions as an infringement on his free speech and denounced the trial as “rigged.” His attorney, Todd Blanche, argued the posts were legitimate responses to political attacks, yet failed to provide evidence of any provocation by the witnesses involved.

The developments occur amid Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting his charges of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment meant to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter. Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty.

According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/arts/television/late-night-trump-contempt.html) by The New York Times (NYT), the $9,000 gag order violation fine prompted late-night comedians to seize the opportunity for some lighthearted jabs at Trump’s expense.

Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” playfully questioned the significance of the $9,000 fine for a successful businessman like Trump:

“I know $9,000 might not seem like a lot to a successful businessman, but what about to Trump?”

However, he quickly followed up with a more serious note, mentioning that the judge lamented the legal limit on the fine and warned that if Trump continues to violate the gag order, jail time may become a necessary punishment. Colbert quipped, “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump, but I need it.”

On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the host took a different approach, arguing that the situation seemed unfair to Trump. Kimmel pointed out the irony of the trial being about Trump paying a woman to be quiet, only to now face fines for not being quiet himself. He jokingly compared the situation to Jesus, a carpenter, being nailed to a cross, and urged his audience to “think about it” and “read about it in your Trump-brand Bibles.”

Kimmel also poked fun at the judge’s warning that continued gag order violations could result in Trump being locked up. He imagined Trump’s wife, Melania, encouraging her husband not to let the judge dictate his actions.

The comedians didn’t stop there. Kimmel took a jab at Trump’s spending habits, suggesting that the former president could easily spend $9,000 at a Wendy’s drive-through. Jimmy Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show,” joined in, imagining Trump’s response to the fine: “But I get the 10th one free, right?”

Decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider Ankr will [introduce](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-x-talus-delivering-btc-liquidity-to-onchain-ai-and-smart-agents/?page=1) Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) liquid staking tokens to AI-focused blockchain Talus starting May 1. 

“Bitcoin is not only the oldest blockchain but also continues to have the highest liquidity,” Ankr wrote. “Unfortunately, this liquidity has traditionally been trapped within the Bitcoin L1. With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols. This enables users on the Bitcoin network to earn additional staking rewards while providing other ecosystems access to Bitcoin liquidity.”

To engage in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), users first delegate their BTC to an operator in a restaking protocol, which is then used as collateral for Ankr to create BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In the case of Talus, the Bitcoin LSTs can be used to power the blockchain’s smart agents or AI assistants and their applications, such as “booking travel, making purchases online, and managing portfolios.”

Smart agents on Talus are also capable of bundling multilayer atomic swaps and executing them in one single transaction to provide security exploits such as flash loan attacks. “Ankr’s BTC liquid staking unlocks a massive amount of liquidity to ensure that smart agents on Talus can execute simultaneous DeFi transactions like atomic swaps seamlessly,” Talus commented. 

The move comes after Ankr [revealed](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-btc-liquid-staking-everything-you-need-to-know/) its first Bitcoin liquid staking product in early March in conjunction with the Babylon protocol. The project allows users to “earn yields from their idle bitcoins in a secure way” by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral to mint LSTs that can be used to validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains. 

Yields earned from the staked LSTs are then funneled back to users’ locked Bitcoin. Currently, the Babylon protocol is in its testnet phase, with a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year. 

Despite an ongoing market correction, the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem has been thriving over the past year with the invention of new protocols such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Atomicals and Runes.

One such project, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, has [accumulated a total value locked of $700 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-defi-ecosystem-thrives-market) from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin and BNB Smart Chain. In a statement to Cointelegraph, SolvBTC claimed that the protocol recently surpassed 10,000 BTC staked and attracted “over 92,000 participants” shortly after its launch earlier this month.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its dog-themed branding, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in whale activity, indicating significant movements of large SHIB tokens. This surge comes after SHIB’s price decline of over 10% over the last seven days.

Whale activity, often a key indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, saw a staggering 268% increase in the case of Shiba Inu. [Large transaction volume](https://zycrypto.com/0-0001-shib-price-tsunami-looks-near-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-massive-transaction-spike/), typically involving transactions worth more than $100,000, surged to $98.12 million within 24 hours.

This surge highlights a significant uptick in whale activity, suggesting that large holders of SHIB tokens are actively buying or selling.

**Dramatic Increase in SHIB Large Transactions**
------------------------------------------------

According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions in Shiba Inu saw a dramatic increase from 1.07 trillion SHIB on April 28 to 4.17 trillion SHIB on April 29. This substantial spike in large transactions indicates that whales in the SHIB market have been particularly active, possibly taking advantage of the price dip.

SHIB has still been down by 12.05% over the past seven days. This divergence between whale activity and price performance suggests a complex interplay of factors driving SHIB’s market dynamics.

**Shiba Inu Ecosystem Key Developments**
----------------------------------------

In other [developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem](https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-beckons-as-shib-devs-aim-to-go-big-with-upcoming-shibarium-update/), the Shiba Eternity collectible card game (CCG) has undergone significant upgrades. The latest version, 1.2.7, introduces enhancements to improve player interaction and strategic depth.

Notable changes include improvements to the social menu, making players connect easier, and adjustments to fighter mechanics, providing a more balanced gameplay experience. Specifically, these fighters have been tweaked to no longer inflict debuff damage on adjacent friendly fighters upon being destroyed.

ShibaSwap, the project’s decentralized exchange (DEX), is expanding to support Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. This move enhances security and interoperability, offering users a seamless trading experience.

Adding to Shiba Inu’s excitement, the SHIB/JPY trading pair has been listed on Binance Japan. This listing opens up new trading opportunities for SHIB holders, further expanding the coin’s reach and accessibility in the Japanese market.

In conclusion, Shiba Inu’s recent surge in whale activity and ecosystem developments paint a dynamic picture of the coin’s evolving market landscape.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting by keeping interest rates unchanged, maintaining the target range at 5.25% to 5.5%. This decision was widely anticipated by market participants and came as a relief to investors, who had been closely monitoring the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.

According to a [report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/fed-meeting-today-live-updates-on-may-fed-rate-decision.html) by CNBC, during the post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided insights into the Fed’s decision-making process and its outlook for the future. Powell emphasized that the central bank’s rate decisions are not influenced by political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He stressed the importance of focusing on getting the economics right and stated that considering political factors would reduce the likelihood of achieving that goal.

Powell also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction process, known as quantitative tightening (QT). He clarified that the decision to slow the pace of reducing the balance sheet is not intended to provide accommodation to the economy or be less restrictive. Instead, the move aims to ensure a smooth process and avoid financial market turmoil, drawing lessons from the previous instance of balance sheet reduction.

When asked about the possibility of the U.S. entering a period of “stagflation,” characterized by slowing economic growth and persistent inflation, Powell downplayed these concerns. He pointed out that, by some measures, economic growth is at 3%, and inflation is below 3%, suggesting that the current economic environment does not fit the definition of stagflation.

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Powell’s remarks was his indication that it is unlikely the next policy move will be a rate hike. This statement prompted a rally in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all initially experiencing sharp gains. Powell’s comments provided reassurance to investors who had been anticipating a potential pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle.

Powell also acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has not yet gained “greater confidence” in the trajectory of inflation this year. He stated that the central bank is prepared to maintain the current target federal funds rate for as long as necessary until there is persuasive evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% target.

While the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, the central bank’s cautious tone and willingness to remain patient in the face of uncertain economic conditions have provided some comfort to market participants. As investors digest the implications of the Fed’s latest meeting, attention will now turn to upcoming economic data releases, particularly those related to the labor market and inflation, which will help shape expectations for future monetary policy decisions.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), XRP as well as several other altcoins turned green during a [speech](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1785745563515834870) by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Powell dismissed market concerns about "stagflation," a scenario in which slow economic growth is coupled with high inflation. He said that he did not see "the stag or the flation."

Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon amplified stagflation concerns, warning that the US economy might be heading back to the 1970s. 

In response to Powell's speech, American businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach said that he expects only a single rate cut this year. He doesn't see a rate cut coming this June. The Fed chair himself has stated that it would be hard to predict how the rates are going to change, but he has predicted that the next policy move is unlikely to be a cut. 

[card](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays)According to Powell, rate cuts could come sooner due to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. However, the decision will still hinge on the incoming inflation data. Powell has stressed that the Fed is now satisfied with inflation staying at 3%. The Fed's goal is to bring inflation back to 2% before it would be able to start cutting rates. 

Interest rate futures are [betting](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1785746107055657129) on a single rate cut in 2024. The first rate cut is expected to occur in September. 

The cryptocurrency market has been [hit hard](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays) by the Fed's U-turn, with Bitcoin logging its worst monthly candle since August 2023. The Fed was previously predicted to implement at least three rate cuts this year.

Bitcoin’s price briefly soared to $59,300 following a selloff that dipped it below $56,700 earlier today, according to CoinGecko’s data. The resurgence came after the Federal Reserve (Fed) had decided to maintain interest rates between 525 and 550 basis points.

In a statement announcing the hold, Powell said the decision to hold rates steady was due to high inflation. As he noted, the Fed plans to continue reducing public bond sales, yet the remaining bonds continue to be sold at the same pace.

&gt; “Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace,” stated Powell, “…in recent months inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.”

Powell noted the solid pace of economic expansion, strong job gains, and low unemployment, despite inflation remaining above the desired 2 percent target.

&gt; “Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” he said. “Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.”

According to him, inflation has exceeded expectations in the short term, yet aligns with long-term forecasts. Due to these higher-than-anticipated inflation indicators, the central bank remains hesitant to lower interest rates.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The Fed has indicated that it will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. However, it also noted that it would consider adjusting its policy should there be an increase in unemployment.

Fed Chair: “I don’t see the stag or the flation”
------------------------------------------------

In contrast to the previous belief that Powell could have a hawkish stance, he maintained a neutral stance during his speech today.

Addressing a series of questions from the media about the state of the world’s economic powerhouse, Powell said there is a low likelihood of raising interest rates further, as current data does not support such a move. According to him, the Fed believes that the current high-interest rates are sufficient to guide inflation back toward the 2% target.

Speaking of stagflation risks, he expressed skepticism about the claim that the US has entered a period of stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation coupled with economic decline.

According to Powell, the defining conditions of stagflation won’t last or fully develop because inflation will eventually decrease.

&gt; “I don’t see the ‘stag’ or the ‘-flation’,” Powell [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/fed-meeting-today-live-updates-on-may-fed-rate-decision.html). “I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he added.

Despite Powell’s neutral stance, Bitcoin’s regained momentum faltered. After briefly surpassing $59,000, it couldn’t hold above this key level. CoinGecko data shows Bitcoin is currently trading at around $57,300, a 3.4% drop in one hour.

Similarly, top ten altcoins experienced a modest post-Fed decision rally, with gains between 0.5% and 2.5%. However, this short-lived bounce quickly fizzled out.

**Dogecoin** DOGE/USD and **Shiba Inu** SHIB/USD have experienced a turbulent month, but traders remain optimistic about [their future prospects](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38552945/how-did-shiba-inu-become-the-dogecoin-killer-crypto-whale-thinks-its-mission-and-this-one-).

**What Happened:** Renowned chart analyst **Ali Martinez** has predicted a bullish breakout for Shiba Inu, highlighting the formation of a bull flag on its daily chart. Martinez is placing buy orders around $0.000018343, anticipating a potential surge in Shiba Inu’s value to $0.000072323.

Meanwhile, crypto trader **YG Crypto** [analyzed](https://twitter.com/ygcrypto/status/1785647800686096467) Dogecoin’s recent performance, which saw a dramatic 40% price drop after reaching $0.228.

Despite the sharp decline, Dogecoin is still trading above the crucial support level of $0.112-$0.123, which previously prevented a steeper fall. YG Crypto suggests that this support level could serve as a potential springboard for a rebound.

However, a break below this support could indicate further downward pressure.

**Why It Matters:** IntoTheBlock [data](https://app.intotheblock.com/) shows a 36.2% surge in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume to $1.32 billion, while daily active addresses increased by 8.9% to 54,630. Transactions greater than $100,000 rose from 407 on April 29 to 490 on April 30, and total exchange inflows increased from $21.9 million to $30.5 million.

However, the recent price drops have reduced the percentage of Dogecoin holders currently in profit from 83% to 78%.

Shibariumscan [data](https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats) points to a surge in active accounts, from 1,724 on April 29 to 3,650 on April 30. Transaction fees have also witnessed a substantial increase, rising from 12.07 BONE to 61.47 BONE.

**Price Action**: At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1274 and SHIB is trading at $0.000022, down 0.9% and 3.9% on the day, respectively.

**What’s Next**: The influence of meme coins and [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment) is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19.

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin layer-2 project Stacks (STX) has announced a significant delay in the activation of the much-anticipated Nakamoto update. The delay was due to the need for an additional eight weeks of development time.

Mitchell Cuevas, who heads the Stacks Open Internet Foundation, detailed the reasons behind the delay in a recent blog post. Cuevas explained that, armed with more knowledge and practical experience with the features of the new network, the core developers determined that they needed a more advanced Signer resiliency/recovery system. This was something originally planned for a later release.

As a result, they anticipate an additional eight weeks of development and testing time before the second hard fork, which will bring Nakamoto features to us in 'Activation'. The new Signer flexibility features are expected to be completed by July 15, with Activation to begin on August 28.

Cuevas acknowledged his disappointment that the dates were changed so late. He wrote: “Fast blocks can't get here fast enough. However, this change is being made to ensure the security and liveness of the network upgrade.”

STX has lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last month.

![Image 1: BONK surges 50%, flips FLOKI in market cap, but key hurdles remain](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bonk-sam-1200x686.jpeg)

*   _BONK Inu’s market cap rises to $1.40 billion, surpassing Floki Inu._
*   _Despite overall memecoin market downturn, BONK gains nearly 50% in two weeks._ 

As the broader crypto market continues to navigate turbulent waters with an overall downturn, the memecoin sector is not immune to the volatility, experiencing a significant drop of 13.3% in 24 hours. 

This decline has reduced the total market cap of meme coins to approximately $45.2 billion. Amid this general market retreat, a notable exception emerges—[Bonk \[BONK\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/bonk-news/).

#### **BONK becomes the fifth-largest memecoin**

While the majority of meme coins have faced downward pressure, Bonk has charted a different course.

Over the past two weeks, BONK has surged nearly 50%, contrasting sharply with the modest 3% gain of its peer, [Floki Inu \[FLOKI\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/floki-news/), according to recent [data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token) from CoinGecko. 

This growth has propelled BONK’s market valuation to $1.40 billion, enabling it to leapfrog over Floki Inu and secure its position as the fifth-largest memecoin in the market.

As a result, BONK now stands as the 58th largest cryptocurrency globally, surpassing well-known names such as [Aave \[AAVE\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/aave-price-prediction) and [Algorand \[ALGO\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/algorand-price-prediction).

Emerging on the cryptocurrency scene in December 2022, Bonk initially flew under the radar until it caught the market’s attention a year later with a [dramatic price increase](https://ambcrypto.com/bonks-bullish-run-begins-but-why-you-should-stay-cautious/).

This surge was fueled by robust investor interest, endorsements from influential figures within the crypto community, and its inclusion on several major cryptocurrency exchange platforms. 

Notably, BONK also ranks as the second-largest memecoin on the [Solana \[SOL\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/solana-price-prediction) blockchain, trailing only [Dogwifhat \[WIF\]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/dogwifcoin-price-prediction).

The latter experienced a significant market cap increase to nearly $5 billion at the end of March as well, before retracting to around $2.2 billion.

#### **BONK: Market outlook**

Despite the recent success of Bonk in overtaking its competition, technical analysis of both BONK and Floki Inu revealed potential challenges ahead.

The daily chart for BONK indicated a bearish pattern, with the memecoin’s price recently triggering a liquidity pull on the buy side, suggesting a possible downturn as it targets the next swing low.

Floki Inu’s 8-hour chart mirrored this sentiment, indicating potential declines for both meme coins in the near future.

Stablecoin issuer Tether, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market behind the widely used USDT stablecoin, has released its audit statement for the first quarter of 2024, accompanied by a report conducted by independent accounting firm BDO. 

The [report](https://tether.io/news/tether-releases-q1-2024-attestation-reports-record-breaking-4-52-billion-profit-highest-treasury-bill-ownership-percentage-ever-total-group-equity-of-11-37-billion/), which provides additional financial information beyond the reserves backing Tether’s fiat-denominated stablecoins, shows the company’s profit for the first quarter of the year, which saw an increased influx of capital into the market. 

Tether Q1 2024 Financials Soar
------------------------------

Digging into the numbers, the first quarter of 2024 proved highly profitable for Tether, with a net profit of $4.52 billion.

The main contributors, the entities responsible for issuing stablecoins and managing reserves, reportedly generated approximately $1 billion of this profit from net operating gains, primarily from [US Treasury holdings](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/tether-buys-8888-bitcoin/). The remaining profits were attributable to mark-to-market gains on Bitcoin (BTC) and gold positions.

The report also highlighted Tether’s success in increasing its direct and indirect holdings of US Treasuries to over $90 billion. This includes indirect exposure through overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries and investments in US Treasuries through [money market funds](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-usdt-tether-8888-btc/).

In a sign of significant growth, Tether also disclosed its net equity for the first time, revealing a figure of $11.37 billion as of March 31, 2024. This is an increase from the $7.01 billion equity reported as of December 31, 2023.

The report also highlighted a $1 billion increase in excess [reserves](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stablecoin-takeover-record-tether-71-dominance-raises-questions-about-crypto-future/), which support the company’s stablecoin offerings, bringing the total to nearly $6.3 billion.

CEO Emphasizes Transparency And Stability
-----------------------------------------

The BDO confirmation reiterated that Tether-issued tokens are 90% backed by cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the company’s stance on maintaining liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the report revealed that over $12.5 billion worth of USDT was issued in the first quarter alone.

Tether Group’s strategic investments, which exceed $5 billion as of the report date, span various sectors, including [artificial intelligence](https://www.newsbtc.com/tether/tether-launches-new-security-policy-freezes-41-sanctioned-wallets/) (AI) and data, renewable energy, person-to-person (P2P) communication, and Bitcoin Mining.

In response to the latest report, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed the company’s commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. 

Ardoino highlighted Tether’s record-breaking profit benchmark of $4.52 billion and the company’s efforts to increase [transparency](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/tether-usdt-cap-90-billion-why-affects-bitcoin/) and trust within the cryptocurrency industry. Ardoino further claimed:  

&gt; In reporting not just the composition of our reserves, but now the Group’s net equity of $11.37 billion, Tether is again raising the bar in the cryptocurrency industry in the realms of transparency and trust.

Will the SEC approve an [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&amp;p=5726)Ethereum ETF this year?

Optimism among market participants is fading—and now that the SEC’s stance on [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.

“If this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told _Decrypt_. 

That’s because of a [lawsuit filed last week](https://decrypt.co/228134/consensys-sues-sec-attempts-regulate-ethereum-security) by Ethereum software company [Consensys](https://decrypt.co/resources/consensys) against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an [unregistered security](https://decrypt.co/228504/sec-declared-ethereum-security-last-year-consensys-lawsuit)—and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in _Decrypt_.)

To be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant’s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers [accusing](https://decrypt.co/228870/sec-gensler-lied-congress-ethereum-patrick-mchenry) SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency’s position on ETH.

While the long-term impact of SEC’s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren’t happening—at least, not without another legal fight.

Spot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot [Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval](https://decrypt.co/210763/bitcoin-etf-approved-sec) for trading in the U.S. market in January—but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, [successfully sued the SEC](https://decrypt.co/154119/grayscale-wins-appeal-against-sec-to-convert-bitcoin-trust-to-etf) to make it happen.

Still, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts [assumed](https://decrypt.co/212478/bitcoin-etfs-are-here-when-ethereum-etf) spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren’t so sure.

[Gensler Lied to Congress About Ethereum, Says Rep. McHenry](https://decrypt.co/228870/sec-gensler-lied-congress-ethereum-patrick-mchenry)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry (R-NC) waded into the escalating feud between financial regulators and the crypto industry on Tuesday, accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of having “misled Congress” regarding the agency’s stance on Ethereum.  McHenry’s comments come following the revelation that the SEC has internally considered Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security for over a year, according to unredacted portions of a lawsuit filed against the regulator b...

Ethereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval [by May 23](https://decrypt.co/227817/blackrock-grayscale-amend-ethereum-etf-applications-after-sec-delays). By last month, analysts were [already cooling](https://decrypt.co/222439/ethereum-etf-may-2024-bitcoin-hype) on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week’s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go. 

Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC’s now-evident position on ETH’s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren’t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that’s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said. 

&gt; Yes dif rules, 33 act for commodities
&gt; 
&gt; — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) [April 29, 2024](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1784934711426511180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

It doesn’t appear, though, that the SEC’s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers—at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the [first-ever](https://decrypt.co/155204/cathie-woods-ark-invest-21shares-apply-for-first-spot-ethereum-etf) Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told _Decrypt_ that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved. 

Van Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well. 

The company’s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved “in time.” 

But he emphasized that Van Eck’s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week’s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.

“This has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,” he said. “Part of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.”

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge Zeus Network will launch its Zeus Program Library (ZPL) that connects the two ecosystems by Q3 2024. 

“These ZPL-Assets unlock a world of opportunities on Solana,” Zues Network [wrote](https://medium.com/@zeus-network/unlocking-connectivity-between-bitcoin-and-solana-with-zpl-zeus-program-library-126d0f9b4d9d) on May 1. “Facilitating activities like DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, DePIN, and more, which were previously challenging on the Bitcoin blockchain.”

ZPL is a set of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) programs that enables developers to integrate native Solana support into decentralized applications and power transactions across multiple blockchains. “ZPL-Assets can be either fungible (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (NFTs), representing a wide range of digital assets,” commented Zeus Network, continuing: 

&gt; “With a market cap of approximately 1.2 trillion dollars, and over 11,000 Runes generating over $135 million in fees within the first week on the Bitcoin blockchain, the potential for value transfer is immense.”

Through ZPL and bridging protocol Apollo, users deposit their Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and, in return, receive ZPL-wrapped zBTC tokens, which can then be used to engage with decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, borrowing, lending, gaming and SocialFi within the Solana ecosystem. 

Developers plan to further expand ZPL-supported assets on Solana to Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals, dubbed “zRuneX” and “zOrdX,” respectively. Other tasks in its Q3 roadmap include enabling Bitcoin staking on its Apollo mainnet. 

Zeus Network is backed by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali. On April 8, the protocol [secured](https://twitter.com/ZeusNetworkHQ/status/1775855748276167018) a $8 million funding round at a valuation of $100 million. 

Released in April, Bitcoin Runes is a new token standard that [expands the functionality](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/runes-supporters-unlock-bitcoins-potential/) of the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling users to tokenize various real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking transfer, and minting of unique assets on the namesake blockchain. 

The Bitcoin decentralized application ecosystem has been experiencing a revival with the invention of such novel protocols. Last month, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables [BRC-20 token swaps](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/6b-scam-accused-court-china-loophole-hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-asia-express/).

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/228301/ronin-path-curated-ethereum-gaming-pervasively-permissionless

Published Time: 2024-05-01T20:41:30

Markdown Content:
Ronin goes against the grain when it comes to the Web3 philosophy. 

For many in the crypto space, the beauty of the blockchain is that it’s permissionless and that anyone can build without a centralized authority. Instead, the [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) sidechain gaming network instead opts for a closed, curated approach at present.

There’s a reason for this kind of early approach, the team says—and it's hard to argue with success, given the vast rise in Ronin players in recent months, plus its [surge to an all-time high price](https://decrypt.co/221552/ronin-all-time-high-ethereum-gaming-network-free-kairdro-nft-mint) in March ahead of the recent markets cooldown.

And there's a path to a “pervasively permissionless” [Ronin](https://decrypt.co/price/ronin) network ahead.

“There are too many developers, too many applications, and too many games,” [Sky Mavis](https://decrypt.co/124884/sky-mavis-signs-deals-with-directive-games-bali-games-tribes-and-bowled-to-build-web3-games) and Ronin co-founder Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin told _Decrypt_. “There are more applications, games, and developers than there are actual real people using these applications.”

['Match Made in Heaven': Why Ethereum RPG Kaidro Migrated to Ronin](https://decrypt.co/226124/match-made-heaven-why-ethereum-rpg-kaidro-migrated-ronin)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anime-inspired role-playing game Kaidro has already made waves on Ethereum scaling network Ronin since announcing its plans to migrate in February. A buzzy free mint in March saw nearly 350,000 free NFTs claimed by Ronin wallets, while Kaidro’s first premium mint on Ronin this week sold out some 9,999 Spark Suit NFTs—with 2,400 of those going in a public sale in just 10 seconds—generating $2 million in the process and pushing Kaidro to become the third most-traded collection on the Mavis Market....

Many open blockchains have an “overabundance” of games, Zirlin believes, while the relatively small number of gamers that are playing in this space struggle to sift through the good and the bad. To battle this dilemma, [Ronin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ronin-ethereum-gaming-chain-behind-axie-infinity-pixels) curates the games that are allowed on its network.

In his personal time—and aside from crypto games—Zirlin only plays games by Nintendo, Blizzard, and Supercell. They’re giants of the industry known for releasing few games, and often really beloved and massively popular games at that.

![Image 1: Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jihoz_2.jpeg@webp)

By curating Ronin’s game library, he believes that the network is aligning itself with these game publishers. In fact, he suggests that the Web3 element “adds another layer on top” by incentivizing gamers to support the network through its token.

“This strategy emphasizes quality over quantity, allowing us to work closely with fewer teams and ensure their long-term success in the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming,” Zirlin explained. “\[A Twitter poll\] [showed us that 40%](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1776637871748730899) of all \[Axie\] gamers were onboarded by a friend or family member. So these are insane levels of evangelism.” ['Apeiron' Open Beta: Should You Play This Clever Mashup of Strategy Genres?](https://decrypt.co/228218/apeiron-open-beta-should-you-play-clever-strategy-mashup)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bored of all trading card games feeling the same? Apeiron blends together a spectrum of genres to produce a refreshing experience. While in closed beta on PC, the game launched a play-to-airdrop campaign which attracted an audience on the Ronin network. Now in open beta via the Epic Games Store and Mavis Hub, players are giving the game a spin and finding the game is more than just token-fueled hype—it’s actually quite good. Apeiron’s unique concoction gives the game a distinct feel, fun and str...

In turn, Ronin accounts for 30% of all active Web3 gamers, the largest share by some margin with Polygon in second at 17%, according to [Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/research/gamefi/game-overview/game-market?series_date-79421=past90days). Despite the model working for Ronin, most of Web3 opts against such an approach.

“In order to win, you need to do non-consensus things. That’s where most of the strategic leverage is,” Zirlin explained. “People want chaos, I guess, in Web3. But for the adoption of a new technology, you need to be more zen. You don't want to confuse people, because the technology is already confusing enough.”

Thus far, a curated approach appears to have served Ronin well. The doors will only be closed for so long, however, as Zirlin admits that open models do have advantages in the long run—and Ronin is indeed eyeing up a more open future.

[](https://decrypt.co/videos/interviews/3GbWbSMh/pixels-founder-luke-barwikowski-on-the-games-wild-rise-and-ronin-move) Looking down the path, one major hurdle in Ronin’s way is scalability. Currently, Ronin claims, the network can handle 7.5 million daily transactions without congestion. This may not be enough once the network is opened to all builders, so Sky Mavis is [actively exploring](https://roninchain.com/blog/posts/scalability-on-ronin) scaling solutions to increase what Ronin can handle. But scaling isn’t just a technical leap, said Zirlin—it’s also a cultural challenge.

“Ultimately, the key factor in scalability is not just technical superiority, but also user adoption and loyalty,” Zirlin explained. “Similar to the console wars of the past, where players chose platforms based on where their friends were, our focus is on curating games that draw players to Ronin.”

['Ragnarok Online' Franchise Coming to Ethereum Gaming Network Ronin](https://decrypt.co/226802/ragnarok-online-franchise-ethereum-gaming-network-ronin)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic Ragnarok Online gaming franchise is coming to Ethereum thanks to a partnership between developer Gravity and Ronin, a sidechain gaming network. Gravity will launch Ragnarok: Monster World, a strategy game based in the Ragnarok Online universe, on Ronin. Ragnarok Online, an iconic massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that has amassed over 167 million downloads globally since its 2002 launch in South Korea, is making its blockchain debut with Ragnarok: Monster World....

Once Ronin turns “pervasively permissionless,” Zirlin said, he expects the number of games deploying on Ronin to accelerate. He hopes one of these games will help drive growth for the network, as current game [Pixels](https://decrypt.co/resources/pixels-ronin-farming-game-airdrop-ethereum) is doing at present and [Axie Infinity](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-axie-infinity-the-play-to-earn-nft-game-taking-crypto-by-storm) did back during the [play-to-earn](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-play-to-earn-games-how-players-are-making-a-living-with-nfts) boom in 2021—but this time without such a heavy-handed approach from Ronin.

When Ronin plans open up the network is still undecided. Once this path ends and Ronin opens its doors, the network will begin to eye up its next big transformation—expanding beyond gaming.

“The endgame is to create an ecosystem that seamlessly blends gaming with ecommerce and payment apps,” Zirlin told _Decrypt_.  "We believe the path to getting there is by bootstrapping adoption and attention through gaming, and then expanding into payments and ecommerce, thereby disrupting the predatory banking system and credit card industry.”

The $6.6 billion market cap niche of Solana meme coins finds room to grow in a day when Bitcoin slides.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solana’s 10 largest meme coins by market cap are all showing gains in the last 24 hours, [according](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins) to data aggregator CoinGecko. While Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins wobble, tokens such as POPCAT and MANEKI soar by two digits.

The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, announced today that there will be no more interest rate cuts until inflation shows stronger signs of going back to 2%. This means that risk assets, such as stocks and crypto, will still be less favorable than US Treasuries. At the time of writing, BTC had fallen 2.7% over the past hour.

Despite this, MANEKI has shown significant 38% growth in the last 24 hours, while POPCAT shot up 24.8% in the same period. Other cat-themed coins with positive performances are MEW and WEN, rising 3% and 6.5% respectively.

WIF, the biggest meme coin on Solana by market cap, also registered 3.7% growth, followed by a 3% price increase from BONK. BOME, the token airdropped to investors of the first ‘meme coin pre-sale mania’ from Solana this year, exhibits the smallest of gains in the group, rising nearly 2%.

The total market cap for meme coins created on Solana sits at over $6.6 billion, surpassing $1.6 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours. According to CoinGecko, they represent the 40th largest crypto niche by market cap, out of 217 in total.

Earlier today, in an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Laxman Narasimhan provided a candid look at the company’s disappointing fiscal Q2 2024 results. Yesterday, Starbucks issued a detailed [press release](https://investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2024/Starbucks-Reports-Q2-Fiscal-2024-Results/default.aspx) shedding light on the complexities and strategic adjustments the company is navigating through these challenging times.

Starbucks reported a 2% decline in consolidated net revenues, amounting to $8.6 billion, which the company attributes to a complex operating environment. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at $0.68, marking a significant decrease from the previous year, with GAAP earnings per share down by 14% and Non-GAAP earnings per share down by 8%.

Key performance highlights from the fiscal second quarter include:

*   **Global Comparable Store Sales:** There was a 4% decline overall, driven by a sharp 6% decrease in transactions but partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket prices.
*   **North American Performance:** Comparable store sales in North America fell by 3%, with transactions down 7%, though mitigated slightly by a 4% rise in average ticket prices.
*   **International Markets:** International comparable store sales saw a 6% decrease, with an 11% decline in China due to significant drops in both ticket prices and transaction volumes.

The company also continued its expansion, opening 364 net new stores globally, bringing the total count to 38,951 stores, split between company-operated and licensed outlets.

The operating margin showed a contraction, with GAAP operating margins decreasing by 240 basis points to 12.8%. This was primarily due to increased investments in store partner wages, benefits, and promotional activities. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is committed to its long-term strategy and is actively implementing the “Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps” strategy, aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring future growth.

The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program reported an increase in 90-day active members in the U.S. to 32.8 million, up by 6% from the previous year. This highlights a resilient aspect of Starbucks’ customer engagement strategy despite broader market challenges.

The Starbucks CEO remarked on the quarter’s performance, “In a highly challenged environment, this quarter’s results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead.” He emphasized the comprehensive roadmap and action plans the company has laid out to navigate through the current complexities.

CFO Rachel Ruggeri also commented on the financial discipline and strategic focus, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to capital allocation and operational efficiencies as they steer through dynamic market conditions.

The Starbucks share price closed at $74.44, down 15.88% on the day.

The 150th Kentucky Derby on May 4 could have more people paying attention to the superfecta odds and top four finishers [than in past years](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/kentucky-derby).

**What Happened:** Virtual horse racing game **Photo Finish LIVE** [announced](https://photofinish.live/news/article/celebrate-the-150th-kentucky-derby-with-photo-finish-live-and-a-free-chance-to-win-100000) a SuperFecta Scratch-Off event that will offer a $100,000 prize to one lucky winner.

SuperFecta tickets are [minted](https://mint.photofinish.live/) for free plus the cost of gas on the Base Network, a Layer 2 from **Coinbase Global** COIN. Photo Finish Live parent company **Third Time Entertainment** counts Coinbase as an investor.

"As a portfolio company of Coinbase Ventures, it felt long overdue for us to build a seamless experience that works with the Coinbase Wallet to set the stage for an unprecedented FREE MINT event — featuring 116,280 Superfecta tickets, a collection guaranteed to include one $100,000 lucky winner.

Users can mint the tickets with Coinbase Wallet or several other supported wallets until the tickets are all reserved. Each user can mint three tickets for free. The scratch-offs can then be revealed and sold on exchanges [like](https://magiceden.io/collections/base/0x3bf097eb787be3ed0b871a02590382ff642933ed) Magic Eden.”

Photo Finish LIVE partnered with **Churchill Downs** CHDN in 2023 to attract new fans to [live and virtual racing.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38365133/exclusive-madden-gaming-veteran-leads-play-to-earn-horse-racing-game-photo-finish-into-new)

"A year ago, Churchill Downs entrusted Third Time Games with helping bring a younger generation of fans to horse racing," Third Time Games CEO **Ian Cummings** told Benzinga. "Superfecta Scratch-Off is our fun way of connecting web3 technology and digital assets to the actual Kentucky Derby results."

Other prizes, including free unraced virtual horses, will also be offered to owners of Superfecta scratch off tickets.

"This simple and exciting process will convert the Web3 world into rooting for their steeds in the historic May 4 IRL race, showcasing Photo Finish LIVE's ability to inject a new generation of fans into one of the world's oldest sports – it's our version of March Madness brackets!" the company said.

**What's Next**: The Superfecta tickets are available until they are all claimed or until the race on Saturday. As of Tuesday, Photo Finish reported that over 26,000 of the 116,280 tickets had been claimed.

The 150th running of the Kentucky Derby takes place on Saturday May 4, 2024 at Churchill Downs Racetrack.

Coverage of the race starts at 2:30 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock, units owned by **Comcast Corporation** CMCSA. The Kentucky Derby is scheduled to race at 6:57 p.m. ET.

"We believe this will have thousands of people who otherwise haven't been introduced to horse racing previously now paying attention to the results of the race on Saturday night," Cummings told Benzinga.

Twenty horses are set to compete in the 150th Kentucky Derby with a $3.1 million prize available for the first-place finisher and a total prize pool of $5 million for the top five finishers.

The 2023 Kentucky Derby [saw Mage win](https://www.benzinga.com/general/sports-betting/23/05/32270092/heres-how-much-100-bet-on-mage-to-win-kentucky-derby-paid-out-and-how-you-could-have-owned). The 18-to-1 odds horse paid out $32.42 to anyone who placed a $2 wager on the win. A $1 Superfecta bet that correctly predicted the order of the top four horses (8, 3, 14, 11) paid out $15,643.

The current favorites for the 2024 race and their gate position are:

*   16\. Fierceness: 5-2
*   2\. Sierra Leone: 3-1
*   4\. Catching Freedom: 8-1
*   10\. Forever Young: 10-1
*   8\. Just a Touch: 10-1

This means the favorite Superfecta tickets right now would be 16-2-4-10 or 16-2-4-8. But as anyone who has watched or bet on horse racing knows, anything can happen.

Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.

Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
----------------------------------------------------------------

It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.

The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.

The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.

This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.

The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.

Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.

They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

Markdown Content:
**Macro Mania.** Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. _Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?_

Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.

Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have [gotten bullish](https://x.com/blknoiz06/status/1785718067554648365?ref=bankless.ghost.io) on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.

Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.

BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…

Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!

Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.

In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after [inventory levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/crude-oil-prices-today.html?ref=bankless.ghost.io) exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.

Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.

While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, [decreasing](https://x.com/FedGuy12/status/1785732034012274930?ref=bankless.ghost.io) the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.

The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.

Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

URL Source: https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/top-10-altcoins-developers-focused-on-in-april-revealed-etheruem-not-in-first-place/

Markdown Content:
April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.

Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:

1.  Optimism (OP) – 541
2.  Hedera (HBAR) – 459
3.  Cardano (ADA) – 432
4.  Chainlink (LINK) – 397
5.  Polkadot (DOT) – 390
6.  Ethereum (ETH) – 323
7.  Cosmos (ATOM) – 301
8.  Internet Computer (ICP) – 295
9.  MultiversX (EGLD) – 247
10.  Aptos (APT) – 228

It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.

This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

Nearly 14,000 wallets have triggered withdrawals from the Ethereum restaking protocol since April 29.

DeFi traders are leaving EigenLayer in droves since the much-hyped Ethereum restaking protocol released its [airdrop allocations](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-to-drop-token-on-may-10) two days ago.

Since April 29, almost 14,000 wallets have initiated withdrawals from the protocol, accounting for roughly 13% of its [user base](https://dune.com/queries/3592801/6052719).

[![Image 1: EigenLayer Withdrawals](https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F6oftkxoa%2Fproduction%2F89fc72120222b4347fe602224329ca96fc604d07-1600x519.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=100)

EigenLayer Withdrawals

](https://dune.com/queries/3636372/6124105)

EigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/). It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).

Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune [dashboard](https://dune.com/hahahash/eigenlayer). That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.

Daily LST Withdrawals

The project is facing [severe backlash](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigen-airdrop-elicits-pushback-from-eigenlayer-community) from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.

Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens. Many community members also criticized the linear distribution of EIGEN, which favours larger depositors.

**Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-explainer/)) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows.** 

With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.

The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
------------------------------------

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 

This indicator is vital for [SHIB’s short-term trajectory](https://beincrypto.com/shib-continues-price-correction-whats-next/), serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.

Conversely, [SHIB has some potential bullish signals](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-trigger-rally-for-shib/) on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move.

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025.

Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.

As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.
