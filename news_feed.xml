Pike Finance has been hacked for the second time in four days, with losses across the two incidents totaling approximately $1.9 million.

In response to the first hack, on April 26, the team immediately paused the protocol. However, this opened up a new vulnerability that was exploited between 21:45 and 22:20 (UTC) on April 30.

Crypto security firm Ancilia quickly [identified](https://twitter.com/AnciliaInc/status/1785440926212751446) three malicious transactions on the [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6baa6332f9a3ed75e727311d6317fb636844d61d9df5e199f9f68711eb632d6f), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdac6af5695ba00b3d229574dbf7fcc326d16b9f8a52ad2620637d3022956d157), and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe2912b8bf34d561983f2ae95f34e33ecc7792a2905a3e317fcc98052bce66431) networks. Ancilia [states](https://twitter.com/AnciliaInc/status/1785452418945429981) the attacker was able to ‘upgrade’ and take control of the Pike Finance contracts, which allowed them to withdraw the funds held within.

The stolen assets were **swapped to ETH** and [consolidated](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23#internaltx) in the attacker’s Ethereum [address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23) before being [deposited](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf8ce549fe83ecaf0d889ef5bda0b613081cefdad5bd82237e3a9014584a95d11) into privacy protocol Railgun.

The hack was [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) by the Pike team on X (formerly Twitter). The post put the losses at approximately **64k OP ($150,000), 100k ARB ($105,000), and 480 ETH ($1.4 million)** and admitted that the hack was related to the previous incident.

The last time Pike Finance was [hacked](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1783989069212799321) (three days ago), it suffered losses of around $300,000 worth of the USDC stablecoin. The resulting funds were swapped for ETH and transferred to the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash.

According to the earlier incident’s [post-mortem report](https://mirror.xyz/pikefinance.eth/M1ToE42vwEHuE6xlz0dVRQwPT0xpaRtpIIw2arOdBAM), the protocol was paused to prevent any further losses while the incident was investigated. The report also admits that the vulnerability had been reported by auditors OtterSec, but that the Pike team “was unable to address the identified vulnerability in a timely manner.”

However, as described in today’s [response](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to the second hack, pausing the contracts inadvertently introduced “an additional dependency within the smart contract code.” This led to a “misalignment in storage mapping” which the attacker could take advantage of, reinitializing the contract and assuming full control.

Pike Finance has offered a **20% bounty for the return of the funds** and has promised to provide a “plan to make users whole.”

The community’s opinions on this response can be seen in the Pike Finance Discord.

After being hit twice in a row, users are understandably upset, and [some](https://twitter.com/deucesofweb3/status/1785576987550957856) have [suggested](https://twitter.com/Picolas_Caged/status/1785581065693778260) that Pike Finance refund pre-sale investments.

This in itself has, [predictably](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785607580146163876), opened up another potential attack vector as scam replies (impersonating the Pike Finance account) promise a refund to victims as part of a common phishing technique.

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38556972/dogecoin-millionaire-says-fair-launches-for-meme-coins-dont-exist-stop-being-delusional

Published Time: 2024-05-01T11:43:05.000-04:00

Markdown Content:
Las Vegas resident **Glauber Contessoto**, famously known as the "[Dogecoin Millionaire](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/08/34016792/dogecoin-millionaires-holdings-drop-from-3m-to-50k-but-remains-optimistic-says-doge-will-r),” took to his social media account to throw light on the concept of fair launches in the crypto markets.

**What Happened:** The heavily followed trader argues that the presence of snipers and bots has created an uneven playing field, making it nearly impossible for average investors to compete.

"These days, there is no such thing as a fair launch," Contessoto asserts. "Snipers, people who use bots and are fucking professional at it, are who you’re going against when a coin launches." He emphasizes that, this cannot be considered a fair launch, as these players are not adhering to the same rules as regular investors.

He further warns that attempting to participate in these launches is a surefire way to lose money, stating, "They’re not playing by the same rules as you, and you will lose money 100% of the time. Stop being completely delusional." He paints a picture of snipers waiting on the sidelines, ready to "crush and destroy a project the second it goes live."

**Why It Matters:** For the betterment of the situation, Contessoto suggests that the best outcome investors can hope for is to support projects with solid teams that understand the challenges posed by snipers and bots.

He advises teams to take proactive measures to protect their projects and communities. They could buy up most of the supply and distribute it over time, allowing the project to grow naturally with a thriving community as the market cap rises.

His suggestion to investors is to focus on these types of projects rather than chasing the so-called "fair launches" that are vulnerable to snipers and bots. He also warns that as soon as the snipers dump their bags within hours of launch, they move on to the next coin that they can demolish and make endless money.

Contessoto famously watched his fortune take a drastic plunge from $3 million to as low as $50,000 when he did not sell his **Dogecoin** DOGE/USD holdings after a massive run-up.

**What’s Next**: The influence of meme coins and [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment) is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19.

On the hourly chart, the rate of SOL is in the middle of the local channel, between the support of $118.47 and the resistance of $127.33. 

As most of the daily ATR has been passed, there are low chances to expect any sharp ups or downs by the end of the day.

On the bigger time frame, traders should focus on the bar's closure in terms of yesterday's low at $121.21. If a false breakout happens, one can expect a bounce back to the $130 zone within the next few days.

On the weekly chart, there are no reversal signals yet. The price of SOL is approaching the recently formed level of $116. If buyers cannot seize the initiative by the end of the week, the accumulated energy might be enough for a move to the crucial zone of $100.

SOL is trading at $122.43 at press time.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kyc-sends-shockwave-through-nigerian-fintech/

Markdown Content:
Four well-known fintech companies have received orders from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stop onboarding new clients. This mandate is part of a larger audit of OPay, Kuda Bank, Moniepoint, and PalmPay’s KYC procedures.

KYC concerns prompt temporary onboarding pause
----------------------------------------------

The CBN directive [influenced](https://techcabal.com/2024/04/29/exclusive-cbn-directs-four-fintechs-to-stop-onboarding/) the operation of these fintech platforms, “they have been put on hold for the time being, meaning those who would have had new accounts cannot continue. 

Each website features a notice of apology, indicating no disgrace on their account for the momentary interruption that affected them. Because no new customers are to be acquired, the continuing operation and the existing customers’ deposits remain safe and sound.”

The move entails the Central Bank devising measures reflecting a series of events in which the legitimacy of the fintech platform was called into question due to loose KYC regulations. 

The story goes back to Fidelity Bank in October 2023, which had similar concerns about fraudulent activities restricting OPay, PalmPay, Kuda, and MonieP transactions. In turn, the banking authority implemented new KYC rules for any related financial institutions, and they focused on fintech startups as the most prominent threat.

Government crackdown on Fintech
-------------------------------

Government involvement in the fintech industry is practically the CBN directive. The alignment of the National Security Agency (NSA) and economic-related fraud agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the battle against financial misdoings exposes their undeniable effort to eradicate such acts. 

The EFCC’s recent blocking of over a thousand accounts involved in unauthorized foreign exchange market transactions clearly shows the extra regulatory attention the financial sector is now subject to. The industry has mixed reactions, from cautious optimism to concerns about intensifying trade tensions. 

While some industries welcome the assistance afforded by higher domestic production requirements to strengthen their competitive edge, others fear that worldwide trade relations may become increasingly complicated.

Although stopping the enrollment of a new customer base may disrupt business operations, the independent decision by the regulators is the right move in that it guards against regulatory infringements as it safeguards the financial risks. 

The recently conducted audit of KYC procedures is undoubtedly evidence of the industry’s determination and commitment to ensuring regulatory oversight.

Regulatory evolution
--------------------

However, amid these interventions, several positive policies and programs are currently being implemented within Nigeria’s financial regulatory structure.

The appointment of Emomotimi Agama as the new Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the crypto community and investors not only for the recent economy but also for the future’s crypto economy is considered by cryptocurrency enthusiasts as an optimistic move. 

The appointment fosters devotion among investors, controls the capital market, and accelerates economic growth. The regulatory authority and fintech start-ups are expected to collaborate to expedite the process of acquiring licenses to operate crypto exchanges in Nigeria. 

Some stakeholders view the selection of Emomotimi Agama as a positive outcome that vows to open a new chapter of consensus between regulators and the crypto industry, which should result in an appropriate framework for innovation and growth.

The CBN’s resoluteness against the currently ongoing activities of e-currency firms, which has led to the central bank’s ban on their customer onboarding operations, further explains the necessity of the KYC process for the financial system. Although they might be less desirable in the short run, such regulatory measures were intended to control standards of compliance and financial risks.

URL Source: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/an-eth-etf-wouldnt-deliver-full-returns-to-investors/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T16:00:00Z

_ETFs bring awareness but are less effective than private funds as an ETH investment vehicle._

With the recent approval, launch and success of [spot bitcoin ETFs](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/19/bitcoin-spot-etfs-register-five-day-withdrawals-streak-ahead-of-halving/), all eyes have turned to the possibility of spot ETH ETF regulatory approval, an outcome we believe to be unlikely under the current administration. Additionally, an ETH ETF will, at least initially, lack a staking reward component, a key aspect of ETH total return.

We see the primary value of crypto-ETFs being the _normalization_ of crypto investing for traditional finance allocators. Large ETF providers entering the space license their legitimacy, allowing allocators to invest in crypto without taking career-risk. However, for all the industry benefits of a spot ETH ETF, the return characteristics are not as attractive as total return options.

At the time of writing, rewards from staking eth are over 3% per annum, according to [CESR, the benchmark composite ether staking rate](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr/). In other words, if an investor invests into an ETH ETF, they may be at a disadvantage compared to someone investing in a staked investment. CESR has been as high as 8% in the trailing twelve months.

**ETH ETFs — A liquidity mismatch due to staking**

Mechanically, staking reduces liquidity due to the validator entry and exit queues. In the summer of 2023 the entry queue rose to 45 days due to a surge in activity. As a network security activity, staking is not designed with the liquidity needed for securitization in mind. Due to the immense liquidity demands of an ETF, issuers will struggle to deliver liquidity and ETH total return, including staking rewards.

**Structural Underperformance**

Passively holding unstaked ETH is akin to holding unneeded fiat currency for long periods in a demand deposit account with zero interest. Said another way, passively holding unstaked ETH will create structural underperformance and, if compared to a total return benchmark, persistent negative tracking error. From any angle, that is an untenable position for an investor.

For accredited investors, private funds offer an effective solution to achieve total return ETH exposure. Buying and staking ETH through a private fund structure does not face regulatory challenges. Managers can also match the liquidity of the fund to stake and unstake ETH on behalf of investors. With a thoughtful operational setup, there are limited tradeoffs; a private fund can be audited, benchmarked, and keep assets in qualified custody.

Markdown Content:
**Coinbase Global Inc** COIN, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Wall Street expects $1.00 in EPS and $1.34 billion in revenues as the company reports [after market hours](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings?tickers=COIN).

The stock has gained over 300% in the past year, riding with the crypto boom. The stock’s surge compares favorably to Bitcoin’s price, which rose by 103.13% over the past year. YTD, shares have returned 17.13%, lagging behind Bitcoin’s 30% stride.

Let’s look at what the charts indicate for Coinbase stock, and how the stock currently maps against Wall Street estimates.

**Coinbase Stock’s Bearish Signals Ahead Of Q1 Earnings** 
----------------------------------------------------------

Charts indicate that the current trend for Coinbase stock is relatively bearish.

![Image 1: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

_[Chart: Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard)_

Its share price at $203.40, is trading below key moving averages. The 5-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $213.25, the 20-day EMA at $226.46, and 50-day EMA at $219.61, indicate selling pressure and a risk of future bearish movement.

Coinbase stock is also trading below the 8-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA), all of which suggest a bearish momentum. However, the stock is above the 200-day SMA of $137.69, indicating a bullish signal.

![Image 2: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

_[Chart: Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard)_

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is -6.11, suggesting a strongly bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 40.64 is in the Neutral zone. However, since March, the RSI has been heading lower, so it could enter the oversold (&lt;30) zone in the near-term. That could potentially be bullish for the stock, if supported by other indicators.

The Bollinger Bands have Coinbase stock trading in their lower band – indicating trader bearishness dominating the stock.

Overall, the technical indicators suggest a bearish trend for Coinbase stock, but with potential trend reversal opportunities once the RSI enters the oversold zone.

**Coinbase Stock Analysts See 34% Upside**
------------------------------------------

**Ratings &amp; Consensus Estimates:** [The consensus analyst rating](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/COIN/analyst-ratings) on Coinbase stock stands at a Buy with a price target of $169.08. However, the latest analyst ratings for Coinbase stock from HC Wainwright &amp; Co., Bernstein, and Compass Point, received in April, point toward a greener picture. These analysts have an average price target of $275, suggesting a potential upside of 34.02% for Coinbase stock.

**COIN Price Action:** Shares of Coinbase are down 1.34% to $201.20 at the time of publication Wednesday.

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/eminem-cryptocom-advertisement-silly

Markdown Content:
![Image 1: off topic with molly jane](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Off-Topic-with-Molly-Jane_20230616a-1.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024)

This isn’t going to be another op-ed about how silly it is for celebrities to do cryptocurrency ads. We all know that they don’t age well.

Instead, what I’d like to opine on is why a cryptocurrency ad with Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, falls flat in particular. If you’re going to put a celebrity in your crypto ad, you need to go all out with creativity, humor or just overall entertainment value. Eminem’s new crypto ad does none of that — it has almost nothing to do with the rapper, or crypto at all.

The rapper’s voiceover on an [advertisement for Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) aired during the Lakers NBA play-off game last week. The ad itself, just a minute long, shows a nameless, faceless boxer getting ready to face-off in a match at the Crypto.com Arena. You can hear Eminem’s voice saying empty platitudes of encouragement in the background, telling the audience to enjoy the moment, before the screen shows the somewhat infamous slogan, “Fortune favors the brave.”

I say infamous, because Matt Damon’s 2022 Crypto.com SuperBowl commercial — where the Oscar-nominated actor was actually pictured on screen saying that catchphrase out loud — just looked so silly in the wake of the FTX crash. Damon later gave an [awkward, pause-filled red carpet interview](https://gizmodo.com/matt-damon-crypto-com-crypto-bitcoin-1850282413), noting that he only did the commercial to support his water non-profit in a down year.

Some are [already speculating](https://www.stereogum.com/2261473/eminem-is-crypto-coms-new-spokesman-teases-new-album-the-death-of-slim-shady/news/) that Eminem’s main motivation to lend his voice to Crypto.com’s latest ad is part of a marketing push for his upcoming album. But his motivations for being crypto’s latest celebrity spokesperson aren’t important. What’s important is how soulless that advertisement is. Watching the commercial for the first time as a longtime Eminem stan, I lamented all of the missed opportunities staring me in the face.

For one, this is far from Eminem’s first foray into crypto — he had his own, pretty cringey Bored Ape phase at the peak of the NFT boom, culminating in a [half-animated BAYT music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrA-slMoZ4) with none other than Snoop Dogg. That was terrible, and also funny: and Crypto.com’s pretty basic ad could have benefitted from any sort of creative reference to Eminem’s actual crypto interests. 

Granted, Crypto.com is not an NFT platform. That doesn’t mean that you aren’t allowed to have a sense of humor — especially when creating a likely very expensive advertisement with a very famous, previously NFT-obsessed rapper.

Which brings me to my second point — there’s no rap. Paying Eminem to remain faceless and read a short, only slightly rhyming text over a black-and-white boxing video feels like paying [Bob Dylan to promote Victoria’s Secret](https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/i-think-about-bob-dylans-victorias-secret-ad-a-lot.html).

Eminem’s crypto ad isn’t the first since the unfortunate crypto Super Bowl. Both Coinbase and Greyscale also [put out slightly more entertaining ads](https://blockworks.co/news/nba-nhl-bitcoin-halving-ads) in the lead up to the Bitcoin halving, albeit celebrity-less ones. 

As I said at the top, my point here isn’t to convince the world that celebrities in crypto ads are setting themselves up for [future embarrassment](https://blockworks.co/news/celebrities-erase-ftx-ties), [loss of money](https://blockworks.co/news/what-do-tom-brady-steph-curry-and-naomi-osaka-have-in-common-an-ftx-lawsuit) and even potentially [SEC fines](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183). We already know that. And I also know that no one will stop crypto companies, especially during a bull market, from paying celebrities tons of money to promote their brands anyway. Sam Bankman-Fried set that precedent, and even with him in jail, it really shows no signs of abating.

Instead, I’d like to propose that if we are going to keep having celeb-studded crypto ads — make them really sparkle. Pay Eminem to write an entire song about trading on Crypto.com and release it alongside his new album, with a specially crypto-themed music video (he already has the experience). Get JoJo Siwa to [wrap another car](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjojosiwa/video/7352686405887331630) with whatever memecoin logo, or Brooklyn Beckham to tattoo Dogecoin eyes next to his [tattoo of his wife’s eyes](https://pagesix.com/article/brooklyn-beckham-tattoos-for-nicola-peltz/).

Celebrity crypto ads, in my opinion, should only exist if they do something really creative or really silly: In other words, make them match the whimsy and creativity of this burgeoning financial tech industry. I’m not sure that any SEC lawyers would agree with me. Good thing I don’t work for the SEC.

Otherwise, make celebrity crypto endorsements illegal for all of the obvious reasons (high potential for securities fraud and misleading investors to start). In a nutshell — go silly or go home.

Bitcoin and Solana non-fungible token (NFT) market registered records in daily active traders (DAT) last week, [according](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/on227-nft-marketplaces) to the research blog OurNetwork. While Solana reached its all-time high of 59,300 DAT, Bitcoin registered a peak of 25,600 DAT.

Solana’s rising DAT number represents a fourfold increase from the approximately 15,000 daily traders earlier last week. The publication attributes this growth to the influx of wallets engaging in sub-$10 transactions on platforms like Magic Eden and Tensor. Over the past week, Magic Eden has captured a significant 74% of Solana’s trading volume market share and 38% of its trader market share, while Tensor has secured 18% of the volume and a dominant 61% of traders.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s NFT trading historical peak was attributed to the anticipation of the Runes protocol launch. However, the trader count experienced a sharp decline to around 7,000 the day following the launch. Magic Eden has been the primary hub for Bitcoin’s NFT activity, commanding 82% of both active traders and trading volume over the last seven days, with OKX trailing at 16% for the same metrics.

Ethereum still reigns, but numbers decline
------------------------------------------

Despite dominating in trading volume and daily active traders, Ethereum’s weekly NFT trader numbers have been in decline over the past two years, with less than 36,000 wallets engaging in trades last week. OurNetwork points out that this is a significant drawdown compared to the 218,000 seen in April 2022.

Similarly, the weekly volume has plummeted from the $1.4 billion peak last April to approximately $100 million per day currently.

Moreover, the Ethereum NFT landscape also shows changes when it comes to marketplace dominance. OpenSea and Blur rivalry was met by the rise of Magic Eden as a competitor since its Ethereum marketplace debut in February. Magic Eden has quickly garnered over 20% of Ethereum’s NFT volume in the last week alone.

![Image 3: Solana and Bitcoin NFT trading hits record numbers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201530%20782'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Although Blur maintains a majority share with over 50% volume, OpenSea’s presence has diminished to 13.5% in the recent seven-day period. Yet, OpenSea still leads in trader count on Ethereum, attracting about 4,000 traders daily, compared to Blur’s 2,500 and Magic Eden’s under 600. Over the last two years, OpenSea has seen a dramatic 90% drop in its weekly trader base.

On the significant trades side, a transaction on the CryptoPunks NFT marketplace involved a 4,000 ETH purchase, valued at over $12 million, for a highly coveted alien punk. This sale propelled CryptoPunks to the second-highest platform by volume on Ethereum for that day, with only Blur surpassing it with $15.2 million in volume.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/investor-charged-with-tax-fraud-in-multi/

Markdown Content:
Roger Ver, a supporter and pioneer of Bitcoin, has faced criminal cases related to mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The indictment accuses Ver of hiding Bitcoin ownership, not reporting important company valuations, and evading nearly $50 million in estimated taxes.

Court documents unveilsRoger Ver’s alleged tax evasion scheme
-------------------------------------------------------------

The court documents [maintain](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) that Ver, who at the time resided in Santa Clara, California, was the owner of two companies, Memory Dealers Inc. and Agilestar Inc., which resold computer and networking hardware. Verkammen’s bitcoin history goes back to 2011 when he allegedly bought the first bitcoins for himself and his firms. He also called for coins in his articles and blogs, where he got the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus.”

He reportedly abandoned her US citizenship in 2014 by becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, just two years after obtaining her citizenship. He moved his Bitcoin assets to the wallet of a family member who had not reported capital gains. 

Under U.S. law, he was also required to echo that. The indictment claims that Ver intentionally underreported his asset in her appraisal by his law firm and appraiser; thus, the jurors suspected tax violation.

False tax returns and undisclosed Bitcoin sales
-----------------------------------------------

In February 2014, 73,000 bitcoins were estimated at his firm’s disposal. This fact is still in doubt, as Ver didn’t report any Bitcoin on their tax files. Moreover, Ver allegedly sold off tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2017, which roughly translated to around $240M. 

He never reported these transactions and missed paying the taxes due to the profits incurred. The indictment charges that Ver had committed acts that caused a minimum loss to the IRS not less than $48 million, according to the law. US DoJ Tax Division Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and US Attorneys Martin Estrada for the Central District of California published the case today. 

The IRS Criminal Investigation Cybercrimes Unit is spearheading the cybercrime arena. Matthew J. Kluge, an Assistant Chief in the Tax Division of the Justice Department, James Anthony, a Trial Attorney, and James, an aide US Attorney, have been essential players. Besides C. Hughes, the lawyer for the Central District of California, some well-qualified personnel are involved in the discussion as well. 

He now faces extradition to the U.S. as a possible option. Roger Ver’s case for tax fraud, evasion, and false filing of tax returns was the second one in a row that emphasized that tax law submission is obligatory and should keep up with the speed of the coin industry development. This allegation sheds some light on the difficulty in regulating digital assets and the authorities’ persistence in confirming responsibility regarding the individuality’s whole sector. While the instance amasses, it may also revive awareness of the unfriendly, anti-investment practices in investors and businesses.

Bitcoin has finally [broken below the $60,000 support](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-nosedives-60k/) level for the first time in two months. The world’s largest digital asset has largely been in a [euphoria phase](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/usdt-dominance-falling-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-to-reach-80000/) since the beginning of the year, particularly after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. However, the current consolidation of the price of Bitcoin indicates the [euphoria might be fading](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/timing-the-breakout-when-will-bitcoin-escape-the-post-halving-consolidation/).

According to a new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin, which has been active for the past 6.5 months, looks to be fading. At the same time, the BTC distribution has entered into the fear zone and investors are now heavily weighted towards selling.

Selling Pressure Rises
----------------------

After reaching an all-time high of over $73,737 in March 2024, Bitcoin has declined by more than 18% as investors take profits. This drop in price has been accompanied by a rise in the percentage of addresses holding losses, indicating increased selling pressure. The percentage of addresses making a profit has [fallen in tandem](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/BTC) from over 99% to 86% at the time of writing.

On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in its recent [report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-18-2024/?utm_campaign=woc_18_2024&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=woc_newsletter) the consolidation action. According to the Net Unrealized Profit &amp; Loss (NUPL) metric, Bitcoin has been in a euphoria mode very early in this cycle when compared to past cycles. Notably, the NUPL crossed over 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the just concluded halving amidst hype about Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

This is in comparison to the 2021 market cycle, where the NUPL was triggered into a profit zone 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving. This metric suggests the market is still in its euphoria phase for the last seven months but has cooled off significantly [due to correction](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-rally-over-leverage-drops-as-halving-highs-fade/) in the past two months.

[![Image 3: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374569&amp;setID=452518&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293218&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714584833824911&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-euphoria-btc-distribution%2F&amp;hc=f009dbbebe1f44c492fac097070229784836a41f&amp;location=)

Interestingly, the report noted a “distinct uptick in net outflows” across all wallet sizes throughout April, indicating the current sentiment among traders. This means traders are now in a sell-side pressure across the board. Furthermore, a majority of short-term (one week to one month) holders have been posting losses on the 90-day +1sd level since March.

What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?
--------------------------------

While the “fear” rating may worry investors, a pullback after such a steep price rise is considered healthy by most crypto analysts. Many long-term holders are still [holding strong](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-3-metrics-solid-healthy-bull-market/) and are waiting for the halving effect to kick in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,899 and is down by 5.35% in the past 24 hours.

Considering the current cost-basis for short-term holders (STH) is at $66,700, and their realized price is at $59,800, many more holders in this cohort have possibly entered into the loss zone. 

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, $59,800 is a [key price level](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/59800-important-level-bitcoin/) to watch, as history has shown Bitcoin tends to bounce over the STH realized price.

*   **Vitalik Buterin uses a multi-sig wallet for 90% of his crypto to enhance security.**
*   **He recommended a multi-sig solution to minimize the personal risks of hardware wallets.** 
*   **In a multi-sig solution, users hold some keys but are insufficient to recover the funds independently.**

[Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin](https://coinedition.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-under-fire-after-sending-325k-to-privacy-protocol/) has explained why as much as 90% of his personal crypto funds are secured through a multi-signature hardware wallet solution. Buterin revealed this information while commenting on a trend urging crypto users to migrate to hardware wallet solutions.

Crypto data analyst Kofi [sparked](https://x.com/0xKofi/status/1785294613579730966) the conversion by painting a scenario where crypto users woke up one day and discovered their investments had been stolen. Notably, stories of devastating losses are rampant in the crypto scene, particularly as the bull market gains momentum. 

As crypto enthusiasts participate in airdrop activities and other endeavors, they become susceptible to [bad actors who create similar but fraudulent activities](https://coinedition.com/investigation-shows-655000-solana-valued-122-5m-sent-to-scam-presales/) intended to steal their seed phrase to ultimately drain their wallets.

Renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT recently [uncovered](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1784935501935390930) that the Lazarus Group orchestrated over 25 crypto hacks to launder $200 million. On the other hand, security firm CertiK [disclosed](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1785262226430926997) that the crypto community witnessed exploits worth $21 million in April, often involving hacks and wallet drainers.

While utilizing a hardware wallet solution could prevent some of these exploits, the founder of the NFT trading platform Reservoir contends that the primary risk shifts to the users themselves. The risks include forgetting or losing the seed phrase, especially if it is hidden too well or stored in a bank safety deposit box and becomes inaccessible due to sudden relocation.

In response, Vitalik Buterin noted that the cited concerns are precisely why he opted for a multisig service like Safe for over 90% of his personal funds. 

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds 🙂
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.
&gt; 
&gt; — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

He explained that multi-sig setups, where multiple keys are required for transactions but not all held by the user, provide an added layer of security.  Typically, some keys are held by the user, but not enough to independently recover the funds. The remaining keys are entrusted to other individuals whom one trusts.

“Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.” Buterin concluded.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) sliced through the $60,000 support on May 1, signaling that the uptrend has weakened. While the fall has muddied the short-term picture for Bitcoin, the [analysts remain bullish for the long term](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-correction-crypto-traders-indicators). 

Traders latch on to every bit of negative news when the price action turns bearish.

Every bull phase witnesses sharp corrections, which shake out the weak hands. The lower levels give an opportunity to the long-term investors to add to their portfolios. However, it is better to wait for the price to confirm a bottom before initiating large bets.

Could Bitcoin and the altcoins start a sharp recovery, trapping the aggressive bears? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis
----------------------

Bitcoin’s consolidation resolved to the downside on May 1, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

Buyers will attempt to push the price back above $59,600, but the bears are likely to have other plans. If the price turns down from $59,600, it will suggest that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That will enhance the prospects of a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($66,596).

Ether price analysis
--------------------

Ether broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,170) and the $3,056 support on April 30, signaling that the bears are in command.

_ETH/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT)

The selling continued on May 1, and the bears tugged the price below the solid support at $2,852. If bears sustain the price below $2,852, the ETH/USDT pair could move downward to $2,700 and subsequently to $2,400.

Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push the price back above the moving averages. If they do that, it will indicate that the fall below $2,850 may have been a fake breakdown.

BNB price analysis
------------------

The long tail on BNB’s ([BNB](https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index)) April 30 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased at lower levels but they could not sustain the momentum.

![Image 4](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/91ded5f1-93b8-4e2e-ad89-0e16a5a412c9.png)

_BNB/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT)

The bears continued selling and yanked the price below the moving averages on May 1. The BNB/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $495. This is an essential support for the bulls to defend because a break below $495 could sink the pair to $460 and later to $400.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off $495 and rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for some more time. The bulls will have to overcome the obstacle at $635 to start the next leg of the uptrend.

Solana price analysis
---------------------

The failure of the bulls to start a rebound off $126 in Solana ([SOL](https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index)) shows that the bears remain in control.

![Image 5](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/6e657e85-5ad9-450c-8d30-3c541e18503e.png)

_SOL/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT)

There is a minor support at $116, but if this level cracks, the selling could accelerate, and the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to $100. The greater the fall, the longer it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.

If bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price above the 20-day EMA ($144). That may trap the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The pair may then ascend toward the 50-day SMA ($166).

XRP price analysis
------------------

XRP ([XRP](https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index)) tried to start a relief rally from the psychological level of $0.50 on April 29, but the bulls could not maintain the higher levels.

![Image 6](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/2f0e7d51-b2a6-4235-9ec0-cbef9185d164.png)

_XRP/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT)

Sustained selling by the bears pulled the price below $0.50, opening the doors for a retest of the solid support at $0.46. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $0.46 and $0.41 because a break below it may start a downtrend.

Alternatively, if the price bounces off $0.46 and rises above the 50-day SMA ($0.57), it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The XRP/USDT pair may then extend its stay inside the $0.41 to $0.74 range for several more days.

Dogecoin price analysis
-----------------------

Dogecoin’s ([DOGE](https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index)) fall picked up momentum after the price broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern.

![Image 7](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/f5f17c7f-2b54-4503-a729-12de28b3d13e.png)

_DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT)

The bears have pulled the price below the neckline of the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. If the price remains below $0.12, the selling could intensify, and the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to $0.10 and eventually to $0.08.

On the contrary, if the price quickly rises back above the neckline, it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will gain strength on a break above the 20-day EMA ($0.15), and a potential trend change will be signaled above the downtrend line.

Toncoin price analysis
----------------------

Toncoin (TON) broke below the 50-day SMA ($5.32) on April 30, indicating that the bears are maintaining their pressure.

![Image 8](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/f5826c63-10fc-4a3d-8096-71ec5e7d9105.png)

_TON/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=OKX%3AtonUSDT)

The bulls are likely to defend the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.90 and the 61.8% retracement level of $4.25. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.58) to signal that the correction may be over. If that happens, the TON/USDT pair may attempt a rally to $6.24.

Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below $4.25, it will signal that the uptrend has ended. That increases the risk of a drop to $3.32.

Cardano price analysis
----------------------

Cardano ([ADA](https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index)) is trying to start a recovery from $0.42, but the weak rebound suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.

![Image 9](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/33707c4d-85b1-4cde-b52c-423f0fe59948.png)

_ADA/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT)

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.48) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price skids below $0.42, the ADA/USDT pair could retest $0.40 support. The bulls are likely to defend the level with all their might because a break below it may extend the decline to $0.35.

The 20-day EMA remains the key overhead resistance that needs to be crossed to suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. If that happens, the pair may attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.57).

Avalanche price analysis
------------------------

Buyers tried to push Avalanche ([AVAX](https://cointelegraph.com/avalanche-price-index)) back above the uptrend line on April 29, but the bears did not relent. This shows that the bears are trying to flip the uptrend line into resistance.

![Image 10](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/dd6ee173-ab09-46e8-b9a9-b331dff8b2a9.png)

_AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AavaxUSDT)

There is a minor support at $31.92. But if this level gives way, the AVAX/USDT pair could plummet to $29.24. The zone between $27.24 and $29.24 may witness aggressive buying by the bulls.

Buyers will have to clear the downtrend line on the way up if they want to signal a comeback. The pair could then rise to $42 and thereafter to the 50-day SMA ($45.68). This level may attract selling by the bears.

Shiba Inu price analysis
------------------------

The bulls tried to push Shiba Inu ([SHIB](https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index)) above the 20-day EMA ($0.000024) on April 30, but the bears held their ground.

![Image 11](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/c198c8b2-10e8-4687-91a4-6f30c1c006d0.png)

_SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source:_ [_TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AshibUSDT)

The SHIB/USDT pair could slide to $0.000020, which is likely to act as a strong support. Any rebound off this level is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.000018 increases.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. Such a move will signal solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.000033, where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/interpol-extradition-paperwork-binance-executive/

Markdown Content:
The Nigerian Central Bureau of Interpol has finalized the extradition papers of Nadeem Anjarwalla, a [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/) Holdings official currently having legal problems. Anjarwalla left Nigeria after [being accused o](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nigeria-holds-binance-execs-eyes-march-20-hearing/)f money laundering and tax evasion and is now believed to be in Kenya. Garba Umar, head of the Nigerian NCB, also pointed out that attempts are already being made to serve a Red Notice to bring Anjarwalla back to Nigeria for trial.

In an appearance on the local “Sunrise Daily” on April 30, Umar divulged that Anjarwalla’s precise location is not known, but his last known location was Kenya. Interpol is coordinating with various countries Anjarwalla may have traveled through to gather essential information, which remains confidential.

Incident Details and Binance Exiting Nigeria
--------------------------------------------

Despite Nigerian officials confiscating Anjarwalla’s travel documents, he left Nigeria on March 22, raising questions about the control of his departure. At the same time, Tigran Gambaryan, Anjarwalla’s colleague, [was arrested](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nigerian-court-delays-binance-executive-bail/) on similar charges. He pleaded not guilty and is detained for his bail hearing scheduled for May 17. Gambaryan’s case led to a petition for his release, which has gained over 4,000 signatures.

Subsequent to this, Binance declared its withdrawal from the Nigerian market after the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria accused Binance of involvement in illegal transactions. In consequence, Binance stopped all transactions in the Nigerian naira and delisted all naira trading pairs from its peer-to-peer trading platform in late February. This move signals a major withdrawal from one of Africa’s biggest cryptocurrency markets.

Litigations and Regulatory Measures
-----------------------------------

The charges against Anjarwalla have triggered a united international effort to arrest and repatriate him to Nigeria. The ongoing case is an indication of Interpol’s growing role in solving transnational financial crimes. This event is a component of overall enforcement measures aimed at compliance and regulatory adherence in the sphere of cryptocurrency.

Markdown Content:
Blockchain development firm Movement Labs has received an undisclosed investment from Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This investment comes on the heels of Movement Labs' $38 million Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.

Movement Labs is on a mission to build an ecosystem of blockchains based on the modular programming language Move, starting with “M2”, a Move Virtual Machine Layer 2 for Ethereum. The company plans to use the funds to expand into the Asia-Pacific region and encourage adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems.

“Binance Labs' support and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to implement our 'Move Anywhere' strategy, focusing on the vibrant and innovative APAC market,” said Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs.

Movement's Layer 2 blockchain aims to expand the use of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed by a team within Meta, formerly known as Facebook's now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.

Additionally, Movement Labs is developing Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The company will launch its public testnet Parthenon in the coming weeks and aims for a mainnet launch by the end of the year.

The Web3 landscape is experiencing a significant shift, with user expectations for their [wallets evolving rapidly](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29175135/eu-tightens-noose-around-russia-bans-all-crypto-wallet-services).

Gone are the days when secure asset storage was the sole function; users now seek a more comprehensive and integrated experience within their Web3 wallets.

Features like DApp browsing, trading, NFT marketplaces, and even inscriptions tools are becoming increasingly in-demand.

In an interview with Benzinga, **Alvin Kan**, COO of **Bitget Wallet**, revealed substantial shifts in user expectations for Web3 wallets over the past two years, reflecting broader trends within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors.

Kan noted that the functionality of these wallets has expanded significantly, transforming from mere storage solutions to comprehensive platforms supporting various Web3 activities.

“Previously, Web3 wallets were mainly seen as secure storage for assets. Now, they have evolved into complex gateways offering trading, DApp browsing, and more,” Kan explained.

He further emphasized that Bitget Wallet has been at the forefront of this evolution since 2018, continuously enhancing its features to meet the growing demand for integrated services like NFT marketplaces and staking gateways.

Kan also highlighted the rise of inscriptions and meme coins as prominent trends driving recent developments in the wallet space.

“Inscriptions have gained traction, especially post-BTC halving and with the proliferation of ETFs. We’ve responded by enhancing BTC network support and even launched our own meme coin, MOEW, which has seen surprising interest from our users,” he said.

Addressing future expectations, Kan predicted that AI and intent-based management would play significant roles in the evolution of wallet technology.

“Moving forward, integrating AI to improve the wallet experience isn't just about adding features—it's about fundamentally enhancing how users interact with Web3 technologies,” he stated.

Kan also discussed the importance of security, a top concern for many users, especially following several high-profile breaches.

“Security isn't just an add-on; it’s integral to the user experience. At Bitget, we’ve introduced keyless MPC wallets and have established strong partnerships for security audits, ensuring our users’ assets are protected without complicating the user experience,” he asserted.

Bitget’s approach to integrating with various blockchain mainnets illustrates their strategic focus on interoperability and user engagement.

“Our recent BWB Points campaign, for instance, allowed users to engage with over 40 different projects, earning points that could be converted into our upcoming BWB token,” Kan said, underlining the potential for such strategies to foster a more interconnected and user-friendly Web3 environment.

As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Benzinga’s upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19 will further explore these developments.

Insights from leaders like Kan will be central to discussions on how the industry can navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the [next generation of digital asset technologies.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38547115/ex-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sees-crypto-industry-entering-new-phase)

**Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) advantages of multi-signature wallets over hardware wallets.**

Buterin highlighted crucial considerations for crypto holders worldwide to keep their assets secure.

Multi-Signature Wallets Over Hardware Wallets
---------------------------------------------

Buterin [stressed](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) the significance of employing multi-signature wallets to safeguard personal funds. He revealed that he utilizes this method for over 90% of his assets. 

With [multi-signature wallets](https://beincrypto.com/learn/metamask-vs-coinbase/), the control over funds is distributed among multiple parties, known as “keys.” Therefore, Buterin advocates for an M-of-N approach. This entails the user holding some keys while the remainder is entrusted to other individuals, forming a decentralized security network. 

Buterin also advised against disclosing the identities of these trusted parties to each other to ensure an added layer of privacy and security.

This reflects the importance of user vigilance and responsible storage practices, as even the most secure hardware wallets are susceptible to user-related vulnerabilities.

Buterin and Watts’ endorsement of multi-signature wallets aligns with the broader industry consensus on enhancing security protocols. Indeed, prioritizing robust security measures is fundamental to risk mitigation and asset protection.

Markdown Content:
**April 2024 witnessed a remarkable 141% reduction in financial damages due to crypto-related [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) exploits, with losses totaling a historic low of $25.7 million.** 

This figure represents the smallest amount recorded since 2021, suggesting a significant improvement in Crypto security measures.

Crypto Security Exploits Drop, Indicating Enhanced Its Safety
-------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto security firm CertiK [highlighted](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1785262226430926997) that the sharp decrease in damages was primarily due to fewer exploits targeting blockchain protocols. The bulk of the April losses, amounting to $21 million, arose from [DeFi](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/) platform attacks.

The repeated breach of FixedFloat’s Ethereum-based hot [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/) resulted in a $2.8 million loss. The same group was responsible for a February attack, which cost the exchange $26 million, perpetrated this incident.

&gt; “Combining all the incidents in April, we’ve confirmed ~$ $25.7 m lost to exploits, hacks, and [scams](https://beincrypto.com/learn/common-cryptocurrency-scams/). This is the lowest figure we’ve recorded, dating back to 2021, and it is a 141% decrease from March,” CertiK said. 

Additionally, exit scams accounted for $4.3 million in losses. These frauds, where founders absconded with invested funds, included notable incidents like the suspected [rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino](https://beincrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-zero-knowledge-misuse/). This is under investigation for potentially diverting $32 million in Ethereum.

Security Score of ZKasino Source: [CertiK](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/zkasino)

Only three major incidents in April exceeded the $1 million threshold, reflecting a strengthening in [protocol security.](https://beincrypto.com/blockchain-security-slowmist-new-crypto-scam/) Among these, the [tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-tokenization/) platform Grandbase suffered a $2 million theft due to a compromised private key, which led to unauthorized token minting and subsequent robbery.

CertiK’s analysis points to an encouraging trend of resilience within the [cryptocurrency industry despite ongoing challenges](https://beincrypto.com/us-recovers-millions-crypto-fraudsters/). The reduction in private key compromises and the lower frequency of high-value breaches suggest that enhanced security practices are becoming more effective.

Fewer key compromises and exit scams are pointed as the reasons behind the record fall.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto protocols witnessed $25.7 million in losses across three major incidents in April, reaching a record low since 2021. Blockchain security firm CertiK highlights that this is a 141% decrease from March’s figures.

The reduction in losses is due to the fall in private key compromise incidents, which plummeted from eleven in March to just three in April, CertiK underscored.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The largest exploit in April involved FixedFloat, with suspicious withdrawals totaling approximately $3 million across multiple chains. FixedFloat acknowledged this as their second exploit by the same attackers since February.

Meanwhile, exit scams also saw a downturn, with the most notable being CondomSol’s pre-sale scam on the Solana network, leading to losses of around $933,000. In total, April experienced 13 exit scams, a 40% reduction from the previous month.

![Image 2: Crypto losses caused by exploits fall 141% in April: CertiK](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20571%20887'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Flash loan attacks in April resulted in the lowest monthly losses since February 2022, with four incidents totaling $129,086. The largest of these accounted for $55,000. Combining all incidents, April’s losses amounted to approximately $25.7 million, the lowest on record since 2021.

However, the brief CertiK report on April losses does not account for the ZKasino controversy. ZKasino’s co-founders allegedly performed an exit scam on April 25, by swapping nearly $33 million worth of Ether (ETH) for their native token ZKAS. The funds were locked on the gambling platform bridge, as users tried to be eligible for ZKAS airdrop.

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/229020/bitcoin-senator-cynthia-lummis-blasts-doj-stance-crypto-wallets

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:09:15

Markdown Content:
United States Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has stated that she is "deeply troubled" by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) stance on non-custodial software.

In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367), Lummis expressed concern at the DOJ's "hyper-aggressive argument that non-custodial software can constitute a money transmission service." She added that the DOJ's stance "contradicts existing Treasury guidance," and "violates the rule of law."

"Arguments against self-custody software threaten the fundamental property rights that are core to being an American," Lummis said, adding that she will fight "for your rights to hold your own keys and run your own node." She further accused the Biden Administration of "criminalizing core tenants of the [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) network and [decentralized finance](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance)."

Lummis' comments follow two recent cases where DOJ prosecutors have pushed for criminal charges against software developers for unlicensed money transmission: an unsealed indictment against Bitcoin mixer [Samourai Wallet](https://decrypt.co/227949/feds-arrest-founders-bitcoin-mixer-samourai-wallet), and a [reply brief](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf) responding to the defense's motion to dismiss in the [case](https://decrypt.co/news-explorer?pinned=277556&amp;title=tornado-cash-co-founder-roman-storm-arrested-for-money-laundering) against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.

&gt; I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.
&gt; 
&gt; My full statement. ⬇️ [pic.twitter.com/M3CHcNTi3x](https://t.co/M3CHcNTi3x)
&gt; 
&gt; — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The DOJ's interpretation of money transmission laws, encompassing wallet developers who have no direct control over user assets, has sparked a backlash among the crypto community.

Crypto advocacy group [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org/dojs-new-stance-on-crypto-wallets-is-a-threat-to-liberty-and-the-rule-of-law/) has characterized the DOJ's stance as "a massive overreach," arguing that it contradicts [existing FinCEN guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf) and [rulings](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/administrative-rulings/application-fincens-regulations-virtual).

In a blog post, Coin Center's director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh claimed the DOJ's position would mean that "every functioning cryptocurrency wallet and smart contract is 'doing' money transmission and every developer is engaged in unlicensed money transmission."

The group has filed an [amicus brief](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-files-a-court-brief-in-defense-of-tornado-cash-developer/) in defense of Roman Storm, arguing that the publication of Tornado Cash's code is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-could-crash-to-50k-predicts-800-billion-bank/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:08:46+00:00

Markdown Content:
As the [cryptocurrency landscape](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) undergoes a volatile shift, [Standard Chartered](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/), a global banking behemoth, has voiced concerns about  Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) price trajectory, suggesting it might drop to the $50,000 mark.

_Geoffrey Kendrick_, head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at [Standard Chartered,](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/) has voiced concerns after Bitcoin’s recent dip below $60,000, indicating a potential drop toward $50,000-$52,000, according to [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/bitcoin-could-drop-further-to-as-low-as-50k-standard-chartered-says/).

Adding to the [crypto](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) market’s challenges are the significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin [ETF](https://finbold.com/etfs/)s and tepid interest in Hong Kong’s newly launched [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://finbold.com/guide/what-is-bitcoin-etf/), the factors Kendrick cites as primary reasons for the recent downturn.

### Picks for you

Key factors include five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and prices falling below the ETFs’ average purchase price. Furthermore, the average purchase price of these ETFs falling below $58,000 increases the risk of liquidation, especially since more than half of these ETF positions are incurring losses.

Additionally, the bank pointed out that the launch of the Hong Kong spot ETF did not meet expectations, with the focus on the low turnover volume of $11 million overshadowing the satisfactory net asset position of the new ETFs.

The broader economic environment hasn’t been supportive either, with tightening liquidity measures in the U.S. which have been worsening since mid-April, exerting additional pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.

Long-term optimism despite current volatility
---------------------------------------------

Despite these immediate challenges, Standard Chartered remains [bullish](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The bank recently revised its [end-of-2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-to-hit-150000-after-halving.html) Bitcoin price prediction upward from $100,000 to $150,000.

The bank recommends purchasing Bitcoin if it falls to the $50,000-$52,000 range, or if the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th, which measures inflation, is favorable.

While the market currently faces downward pressure, the underlying momentum and institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin might rebound strongly. This belief is anchored in the crypto’s past performance and its foundational role in the digital asset space, pointing towards recovery as market conditions improve and as strategic investments in the ecosystem continue to unfold.

A prospective stablecoin bill will likely not be included in upcoming must-pass Federal Aviation Administration legislation as lawmakers try to get the bill across the finish line. House and Senate leadership have indicated the FAA will be "clean" of bills lawmakers have been looking to attach, so it is unlikely that a stablecoin bill will be included, according to a Democratic aide. Lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., ranking Democrat Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had reportedly discussed attaching the bill to upcoming FAA reauthorization, which could accompany cannabis legislation. That must-pass reauthorization is up against a May 10 deadline.

If you think the recent dips in the price of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) is bad, leading financial firm Standard Chartered could further darken your mood, concluding that the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap could fall as far as $50,000.

In a Wednesday note, Geoffrey Kendrick—digital assets researcher at the British company and lead author of the report—said that “the broader macro backdrop has deteriorated for assets like crypto that thrive on liquidity.”

“The driver seems to be a combination of crypto specific and broader macro,” he added, noting that Bitcoin’s break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-$52,000 range.

[Bitcoin Will Hit $100K in 2024, Predicts Standard Chartered—Again](https://decrypt.co/207767/bitcoin-will-hit-100k-in-2024-predicts-standard-chartered-again)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by next year, British multinational bank Standard Chartered has said.  The bank made its first bullish predictions back in April, predicting that the largest digital coin would hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.  In July, its team of analysts projected that Bitcoin could hit $120,000 in the same timeframe.  While the protracted bear market that dominated 2023 is only recently showing signs of thawing, the bank is again saying Bitcoin could hit $100,000—and that a Bitcoin...

Just last month, Standard Chartered [predicted](https://decrypt.co/227946/bitcoin-price-prediction-150000-in-2024-standard-chartered) that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 per coin by the end of the year.

Bitcoin had been on a wild run following the January [approval](https://decrypt.co/210763/bitcoin-etf-approved-sec) of 11 [Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-etf-explained-guide-learn-easy) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At the start of the year, it was trading for a little over $44,000. 

Capital flooded the market as investors with typically no exposure to cryptocurrencies were suddenly able to buy shares that track the price of the asset via brokerage accounts. 

Record amounts of money [hit the products](https://decrypt.co/219726/bitcoin-etf-record-inflows-673-million-one-day-blackrock) in the months following their launch, and in March, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $73,737.

But the hype has cooled, and the Federal Reserve has meanwhile signaled it will keep interest rates higher for longer—scaring investors away from “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin.

As a result, the funds have experienced significant outflows. 

Despite touching a new record in March, the [price of Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) today stands at $56,900, after dropping 13% in seven days. Since April, it has traded well below its 2021 record of $69,044.

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:26:05+00:00

Markdown Content:
A new report published by the UK government's financial arm has revealed that cryptocurrency companies, along with retail banking, wholesale banking and asset management, are among the top money laundering risks between 2022 and 2023.

The report's conclusions were drawn from risk assessments carried out on 238 firms by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA, a financial regulator in the United Kingdom, has been trying to get crypto firms to register with it and comply with money laundering rules since 2020.

According to the report, the United Kingdom is making intense efforts to suppress cryptocurrency-related crimes. In October 2022, UK police announced that they were deploying crypto tactical advisors across the country to assist in the seizure of digital assets linked to criminal activity. The National Police Chiefs' Council reported that they managed to seize hundreds of millions worth of crypto from crimes.

Data from the newly published report showed that between 2022 and 2023 the FCA had 52 full-time financial crime specialist staff dedicated to anti-money laundering supervision. Of these, 15 were focused on regulating crypto businesses.

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) is experiencing a significant downturn, marking its second-longest streak of weekly red candles in its history. This development has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with investors expressing concern over the potential implications for the [cryptocurrency](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/)‘s future.

Starting on April 1, Bitcoin began a five-week losing streak, opening at $71,300 and dropping to $57,300 by May 1. This situation is particularly noteworthy as it comes in the midst of a supposed [bull market](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) directly following the Bitcoin halving event.

Historically, Bitcoin has only experienced similar losing streaks in [bear market](https://finbold.com/guide/bear-market-definition) cycles, making the current situation unique and raising questions about its implications.

### Picks for you

Nevertheless, the trading week is not over, and a rally above $71,300 would revert this 5-week losing streak.

The _Bitcoin Archive_ account on [X](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-x-stock/) highlighted the significance of this downturn in a [post](https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1785686389738127380), comparing it to past events.

&gt; “Bitcoin is 23% off its all-time high. So why does it feel worse than it is? This is the second-longest run of RED weekly candles in Bitcoin history! Both times were deep into a bear market.”

Despite the current situation, the _Bitcoin Archive_ offered some perspective. The analyst pointed out that after the last red candle streak, Bitcoin experienced a six-month run of green monthly candles, followed by another five months of gains.

This historical precedent suggests that while the current situation may be alarming, it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bear market.

Short-term bearish forecast amid a weekly red streak
----------------------------------------------------

Adding to the uncertainty, [Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin could drop as low as $50,000](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-could-crash-to-50k-predicts-800-billion-bank/). This forecast comes amid a broader context of market speculation and various predictions about Bitcoin’s future price movements.

However, it is essential to note that many factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, influence Bitcoin’s price.

In this context, potential [Bitcoin miners’ capitulation surges as revenue drops to a six-month low](https://finbold.com/capitulation-incoming-bitcoin-miners-revenue-drops-to-a-6-month-low/) of $30 million. Moreover, [long-position traders were liquidated for $400 million in losses](https://finbold.com/long-position-traders-lost-400-million-in-a-24-hour-bloodbath/) since April 30.

Given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Bitcoin will continue its downward trend or rebound to new highs. Investors and market observers will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds in the coming weeks and months.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent performance has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with concerns over a potential bear market emerging. Yet, historical precedents and the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market suggest that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

As always, investors and market participants should exercise caution and stay informed about the latest developments in the rapidly evolving world of [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/).

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38559762/who-is-binances-new-ceo-richard-teng-and-can-he-fill-czs-shoes

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:04:56.000-04:00

Markdown Content:
The crypto world was rocked when **Changpeng Zhao**, the enigmatic founder and CEO of **Binance** BNB/USD, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering (AML) [program at the cryptocurrency exchange.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38532677/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison)

While Zhao’s legal troubles were brewing, his successor, **Richard Teng**, had already quietly assumed the reins as CEO, tasked with steering the exchange through this turbulent period.

Who is Teng and what does his leadership mean for the future of Binance?

**Richard Teng: A Regulator Steps In**

Prior to taking the helm at Binance, Teng held a crucial role as the Chief Compliance Officer, leveraging his experience as a former regulator at Singapore’s central bank.

This background positions him strategically to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges.

Teng’s leadership has been marked by a clear focus on compliance.

He has publicly acknowledged the need for significant changes within Binance, stating that the exchange’s previous approach to regulation was “inadequate.”

This shift is evident in several key initiatives, including:

*   **Establishing a Global Headquarters:** Previously operating with a decentralized structure, Binance is now actively seeking a physical headquarters, a move that signals a willingness to cooperate with regulatory bodies.
*   **Re-entering Regulated Markets:** Binance has made efforts to re-enter markets like India and Thailand, demonstrating a commitment to adhering to local regulations.
*   **Increased Transparency:** Teng has emphasized the importance of transparency and user protection, initiatives that could potentially rebuild trust with regulators and users alike.

Before joining Binance, Teng was recognized for his innovative regulatory approaches at Abu Dhabi Global Market and had pivotal roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange​​.

His expertise is seen as pivotal in navigating Binance through its complex regulatory challenges, especially after the company agreed to a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over accusations of violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws​.

Under Teng’s leadership, Binance is not just focusing on rectifying past issues but is also pushing forward with new initiatives.

The company has ramped up its compliance measures, strategically hiring key talents from regulatory bodies and major financial institutions.

This focus on compliance is part of Teng’s broader strategy to foster trust and ensure Binance’s growth in the highly scrutinized cryptocurrency market​​.

Moreover, Teng is setting his sights on broadening Binance's operations, with significant expansions in the Middle East and Europe.

The United Arab Emirates and France have been chosen as regional headquarters, reflecting Teng’s familiarity with the MENA region and the strategic importance of the European market under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation​.

**Challenges And Uncertainties Remain**

Despite these efforts, Binance still faces significant challenges.

The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.US, Zhao, and Teng himself, alleging unregistered exchange operations and commingling of user funds, looms large.

Additionally, regulatory scrutiny in various regions continues to cast a shadow over the exchange’s global operations.

**The Road Ahead: A New Era For Binance?**

While Zhao’s return after his sentence is expected, the long-term impact of his imprisonment and the changing regulatory landscape remain to be seen.

Richard Teng’s leadership presents an opportunity for Binance to embrace a more compliant and transparent approach, potentially paving the way for a new era of stability and growth.

However, navigating the intricate web of global regulations and regaining the trust of both regulators and users will be a monumental task.

The success of Teng’s leadership will hinge on his ability to effectively address these challenges and steer Binance towards a more sustainable future.

**Looking Towards The Future Of Digital Assets**

Events like Benzinga’s [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) on Nov. 19 will be crucial platforms for industry leaders and experts to dissect the evolving regulatory landscape and its impact on major players like Binance.

Amid an apparently growing crackdown on the crypto industry from American regulators, U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Block, the Jack Dorsey-founded company behind Square and Cash App.

Federal prosecutors have been probing the internal processes of the company—including its crypto business—according to a report from [_NBC News_](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181) published Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.

Prosecutors are reportedly investigating "alleged widespread and yearslong compliance lapses," per the report, guided by a former employee who provided information regarding such issues.

Block allegedly handled crypto transactions from terrorist groups, the report claims, and otherwise handled "thousands of transactions" from economically sanctioned countries such as Iran, Russia, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela.

It’s getting easier to get your hands on Bitcoin. And Jack Dorsey’s payments company Block aims to go a step further for Square retail customers thanks to a new feature announced Wednesday. The company said that stores using its Square tech will now be able to automatically convert a portion of daily sales into the cryptocurrency, in tandem with Block's own Cash App product for consumers. Block—which rebranded from Square Inc. in 2021—is the company behind both popular payment products. Square s...

Furthermore, the report alleges that the company did not address such compliance lapses when alerted, and that "most" of the transactions in question—including those pertaining to Bitcoin transactions—were not reported to the government.

Block did not immediately respond to _Decrypt_'s request for comment. The company provided the following statement to _NBC News_:

“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

*   **Ripple has just made a major move into the Japanese market through a partnership with HashKey DX.**
*   **This expansion has occurred amidst ongoing regulatory challenges in the US.**
*   **XRP has experienced an initial surge, but a pullback caused by Bitcoin has raised questions about its future trajectory.**

[Ripple](https://dailycoin.com/ripple-xrp-xrp-industry-leader-or-cryptocurrency-dinosaur/), a leading blockchain solutions provider, has partnered with HashKey DX, a Tokyo-based blockchain consulting firm. This collaboration marks Ripple’s expansion into the Japanese market, aiming to revolutionize supply chain finance for Japanese enterprises through the use of [XRP Ledger](https://dailycoin.com/xrp-ledger-xrpl-ripple-scalable-blockchain/) technology.

Ripple’s XRP Takes Aim at Japanese Market
-----------------------------------------

The [partnership](https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1785128947870507420) leverages the efficiency and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain platform known for its rapid settlement speeds. This technology will be utilized to address the complexities of enterprise-level financial operations in Japan, particularly within supply chain finance.

This move builds upon HashKey Group’s success in China, where their blockchain solutions have significantly boosted trade and financing operations. Together with SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple, the partnership will introduce innovative solutions specifically designed for the Japanese market.

Ripple’s expansion into Japan is crucial, as the company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Despite these challenges, the announcement has generated positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s native token, [XRP](https://dailycoin.com/ripple-xrp-xrp-industry-leader-or-cryptocurrency-dinosaur/), experienced an initial price surge, reflecting optimism surrounding its Japanese expansion efforts.

XRP Price Pulls Back After Recent Gains
---------------------------------------

However, XRP’s price has since experienced a pullback, trading around $0.493. This volatility is further underscored by XRP’s declining price over recent months, falling approximately 21% year-to-date.

Several hurdles lie ahead for XRP, including trading below key exponential moving averages and a scheduled 1 billion token unlock on May 1, valued at roughly $493.4 million. This monthly sell-off could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price in the coming weeks.

The market’s Relative Strength Index hovers near the 35 mark, indicating a balanced state between buyers and sellers. However, as it nears oversold territory, the future trajectory of XRP remains uncertain, especially with Bitcoin’s recent drop adding more pressure. Investors are now waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next significant price movement.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **If Bitcoin doesn’t recover from its drop below $60,000, it could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price.**
*   **The Relative Strength Index sits near 35, suggesting a balanced market with no clear buying or selling pressure.**

Why This Matters
----------------

This partnership marks a significant step for Ripple’s international expansion, particularly considering the established success of HashKey’s blockchain solutions in China. By focusing on revolutionizing supply chain finance within the Japanese market, Ripple positions itself to potentially disrupt a crucial sector and gain a strong foothold in a historically receptive crypto market.

The FED interest rate decision, which was eagerly awaited by the cryptocurrency and traditional markets, was finally shared with all investors.

The Fed decided to leave the interest rate steady. The expectation was that interest rates would be kept constant.

Here is Bitcoin's first reaction after the decision:

![Image 1](https://www.bitcoinsistemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ekran-goruntusu-2024-05-01-210219.png)

Now all eyes are on FED President Jerome Powell. Powell is expected to make a speech at 21:30 GMT after the FED's third meeting of the year. You can follow all the details of this speech live on Bitcoinsistemi.com.

At the close of the two-day meeting that started on Tuesday, the FED was expected to keep the short-term interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. FED officials are not planned to update their March forecasts for the economy, inflation and interest rates. But Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may offer clues about where he thinks interest rates are headed.

Interest rates have been trending sideways for months. Forecasters predicted that the first interest rate cut would be made in June and that there would be a total of three interest rate cuts by 2024. Now they are predicting only one discount in September.

Economic forecasters will be scrutinizing Jerome Powell's words very carefully when he talks about where interest rates might go.

Economists at Goldman Sachs and Barclays expect Powell to reiterate his earlier comment today that “it will likely take longer than expected to achieve the greater confidence” needed to cut interest rates.

Barclays economist March Giannoni doesn't expect Powell “to be very specific about the number of reductions.”

URL Source: https://ambcrypto.com/binance-after-czs-arrest-these-execs-prompt-global-manhunt/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T18:00:50+00:00

Markdown Content:
![Image 1: Binance: After CZ's arrest, these execs prompt global 'manhunt'](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _Nigerian authorities are pursuing Binance executives for currency devaluation._
*   _Contrasting legal outcomes raised questions about fairness in treatment._

Just as [Binance’s \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) founder made headlines for a [4-month](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-billionaire-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/) prison sentence on money laundering charges, Nigeria intensified its pursuit of two Binance officers from Africa. 

On February 2024, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional head for Africa, and his colleague, Binance’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer Tigran Gambaryan, faced accusations for allegedly facilitating the devaluation of the Naira (Nigeria’s official currency). 

#### **The reason behind Binance head’s escape** 

Despite being invited for discussions to resolve tensions, their visit took an unexpected turn. Detained by security agencies, they were pushed into a legal mess, prompting Anjarwalla’s daring escape.

This incident ignited a global pursuit, escalating concerns about the intersection of cryptocurrency and international law enforcement. 

Remarking on the same, Mr. Gabra Omar, Vice President of the Interpol Africa Executive Committee on Extradition in a recent [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIaM_Z_v2Y) with Sunrise Daily noted, 

&gt; “As soon as this individual escaped, there was a massive manhunt for this individual.”

He added, 

&gt; “We have done that to make sure that he doesn’t escape justice…one day he will be brought to justice. It’s just a matter of time.”

#### **The dichotomy of punishments** 

However, in an unexpected twist, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a [four-month](https://ambcrypto.com/hnt-cryptos-45-surge-will-it-break-through-to-10-or-fall-back/) prison sentence, contrary to the Department of Justice’s expectation of at least three years.

In contrast, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder, faced a severe downfall, resulting in a 25-year prison term for fraud.

This juxtaposition highlighted potential disparities in the legal treatment of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world. 

#### **Interpol’s VP confident in extradition efforts**

Nigeria’s proactive stance against money laundering and terrorism financing in the crypto sphere isn’t a recent development.

The recent freeze of more than 1,100 accounts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) underlines this commitment. 

Furthermore, the potential extension of the crypto crackdown to platforms such as Bybit, KuCoin, and OKX underscores Nigeria’s ongoing efforts in this regard. 

Ergo, Omar is confident in the extradition of Binance’s Anjarwalla, claiming, 

&gt; “You hide, we smoke you out!”

EigenLayer, the Ethereum "restaking" project that quickly shot to the top ranks of the DeFi leaderboards thanks to so-called airdrop farmers, finally acknowledged plans to launch its own EIGEN token. The terms of the planned airdrop – or "stakedrop" as Eigen Foundation described it – left many traders disappointed, especially [those who failed to manage their expectations](https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1785312630908866583). And there were also lots of questions about how the EIGEN tokenomics will work – and when. In this week's episode, we attempt to simplify it all; readers should manage their expectations.

**INTERSUBJECTIFYING THE FORKIFICATION:** The Ethereum restaking project **EigenLayer,** whose plan to repurpose the Ethereum blockchain's security to hordes of additional protocols has prompted [systemic risk warnings from Vitalik Buterin himself](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/17/ethereum-restaking-worries-vitalik-buterin-heres-why/), released a [43-page whitepaper](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf) on its forthcoming EIGEN token – more than twice as long as the original [19-page whitepaper](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/assets/files/EigenLayer_WhitePaper-88c47923ca0319870c611decd6e562ad.pdf) on EigenLayer. To address the concerns, the project, led by the [sesquipedalian](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sesquipedalian) computer engineer [Sreeram Kannan](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-protocol/eigenlayers-blueprint-for-a-decentralized-trust-network/), came up with a new plan for something called "intersubjective forking." The purpose of this mechanism would be to take care of "instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved." If such an "intersubjective fault" were to occur, the EIGEN token could be forked without having to fork the main Ethereum blockchain. Are you with me so far? Well, there's a catch, according to a [blog post](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/eigen/): Very little of this will be functional when the EIGEN token launches: "With its design being completely novel, the concept needs to be absorbed and discussed widely by the ecosystem participants. The initial implementation of intersubjective staking at this launch mirrors the full protocol to only a limited extent. However, there are still several parameters that need to be determined for full actuation." Such a not-really-fully-functional system would echo EigenLayer's mainnet launch a few weeks ago, where, as [detailed by Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/10/eigenlayer-cryptos-biggest-project-launch-this-year-is-still-missing-crucial-functionality/), crucial promised features, including the paramount "slashing" and "attributable security" mechanisms, were held back from the launch, because they weren't ready. It goes without saying that a lot of these details were lost on crypto traders who had poured some $15 billion of deposits into the project, many of them merely hoping to qualify for the EIGEN token airdrop that roughly zero people in crypto doubted would eventually come. The [parsimoniousness of the terms](https://blog.eigenfoundation.org/announcement/), however, apparently left many of these so-called airdrop farmers wanting. "Not all feedback was glowing," as the [Bankless newsletter put it](https://www.bankless.com/mixed-eigen-feelings), and complaints centered partly on the token's initial period of "non-transferability." Only 15% of the tokens will go to the "stakedrop" – the Eigen Foundation's term – and more than half of the tokens will be allocated to investors and early contributors, with unlocks starting after just one year.

_In this schematic from the EIGEN token whitepaper, "intersubjectively attributable faults" lies somewhere between "objectively attributable faults" and "subjective faults."_

Bitcoin Price Snaps Record 7-Month Winning Streak
-------------------------------------------------

Predictions earlier this year that bitcoin might not see a big rally in connection with last month's quadrennial halving proved true, in hindsight. The bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) price slid 15% in April, snapping a seven-month winning streak that was the longest in trading data going back to 2012.

Even so, bitcoin managed to lose less than every other coin in the [CoinDesk 20](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/) index of digital assets. The index itself fell 26%.

Amid the market selloff, [NEAR](https://www.coindesk.com/price/near-protocol/) held up the best among smart-contract blockchains. Aptos's [APT](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aptos/) lost 53%.

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/bitcoin-etf-selling-greens-eths-ratio

Markdown Content:
The six months long ETF advantage that bitcoin has enjoyed seems to be over for now. That brings it back into a somewhat equal footing with eth.

Ethereum's value against bitcoin fell and fell as the bitcoin ETFs drove the show. Now it is rising as they temporarily exit.

Back in October when the ETF story started, eth was above 0.06 BTC. Since then it fell even below 0.047, but now it trades above 0.05 and might head for that 0.06 again.

That's if it gets an eth season. Everyone has had one. Bitcoin, Solana, memecoins, but not eth. It will at some point.

When? Well, eth is the only crypto to get an ETF during Asia trading hours. Their debut coincided with a mini-bear, but the $200 million inflows on the first day suggest the Hong Kong ETFs have been underestimated.

It's the Labour Day holiday in many places across the world today, celebrating the workers, so we didn't get any HK inflows overnight. Tonight therefore we'll start getting a better idea on whether the opening day was a blip.

If it keeps at even $100 million to start with, then the US outflows should be cancelled, easing pressure on bitcoin.

Eth doesn't have that pressure at all - in isolation, focusing on just these ETFs - so any buy is a buy for eth, no cancelling as such.

On the minus side, eth is getting circa 20% of the bitcoin inflows in HK, which is what you'd expect, even if we disagree as eth's market cap, $350 billion, looks undervalued to bitcoin's $1.1 trillion.

The allocation ratio may change if there is an eth season, when Asia can play - unlike US - including the Chinese which of course can access HK markets, just not through mainland brokers.

But even if it remains the same, the bitcoin ratio should change because it is pure new demand for eth, while for bitcoin it is cancelling supply, if that.

Ethereum therefore has been showing strength. Bitcoin fell to what at $75k would look like a calamity, $57k. Ethereum fell from $3000 to $2800 recently, which would look bad from $4k, but not for the more recent price action.

Yet eth is not quite bulling. It's more resisting better than saying 'we're taking the show boys.' Why, is a very big question.

Part of the answer may be that bitcoin has only now kind of given the stage. Usually there's some calm as the market digests, unless we go more down and that's the stage.

Once this down boy gets off however, and the market decides he is off, we get the little cryptos usually showing excitement first, with eth following or this time eth is the 'little' one.

Of course, an approval of the eth ETFs by SEC would be a big catalyst sometime later this month, but issuers' comments suggest they are more likely to deny it.

That will show that the executive in America has become far, far too arrogant and needs some chains by the taxpayer, but that's a long term thing. Shorter term, our hope is we see a demand for punitive damages, which are basically a fine that the court can impose when the lawsuit inevitably follows.

Presuming denial, it's always difficult to foresee what can green it, but somewhat easy to see what commentary would follow if it does green without a specific catalyst.

Airdrops are currently not very bull because EigenLayer has been a bit stingy and even political in banning places like Canada, or the nice beaches and sunshine of Albania, a NATO country and almost in the EU. Like, what?

But, they're just one of many. Renzo just airdropped at a bit of an inopportune time, so their's isn't worth much either, but that's during a mini-bear.

A dapp called Ionic airdrops tomorrow. Another one called ZeroLend airdrops on Monday. An L2 called Mode airdrops on Sunday, and these are just the ones we've played with.

Would we buy any of them? Renzo maybe because the way we see this dapp is as running staking and restaking infrastructure, basically Lido. They're new, we haven't had time to even look at the team, but staking infrastructure has an obvious business case.

The other ones don't seem to have any uniqueness, except that they participated in the points season, but it depends on execution and that's unpredictable.

Beyond points season, the chances that eth does fully scale in a fairly reasonable time, by the next cycle, have increased.

It's possible to see now how we can go mainstream in usage, and eth would probably be the one to pave the way.

Cracking scaling opens up tons of opportunities and the lawyers barricade that is now being established might allow for more of those opportunities to be executed.

One daring aspect is DePIN, as they're calling it. Decentralized physical infrastructure. This has always somewhat been around, paying tokens to trade solar energy or wifi - though they talk more about computers for AI - but it now has reached the stage of having its own acronym and a new word for the dictionary.

The China crypto exchanges ban in 2017 put a lot of that depin stuff on the back burner, but if we have reached the stage where we can start again, that would be excellent news.

A lot of it is very cool stuff, things like common ownership of drones at the more imaginative end, but it is hard stuff and it's actual innovation which is both risky and can be slow.

The way we see it though at the very high level where investors are concerned is as basically opening up the markets to the crypto way outside of just finance.

The idea of the project doesn't matter in the face of the far bigger idea: reviving industry by bringing our financial code innovations to industry.

Another way of saying it is capitalism for all, not just the rich and not just in finance/code. That means the lawyers army will need a boost if this works out, but it is necessary both because the only way out of stagnation outside of the Magnificent Seven is growth and because we have to do it, cleverly, if the more stupid ones are to not get more stupid ideas.

DePin: so new, we have not yet red even one article on it, yet so old we know it is super cool, but execution is something else.

Outside these pins and points and scaling becoming more realistic - though not yet fully fleshed out in execution - if there is an eth season we'd say it's because the ratio fell too much so it had to rise.

The defi season starts first, and maybe it hasn't reached the level of season, but if the market calms, people might start looking for more yield opportunities, and for some that may well mean converting more fiat as such opportunities increase.

This feeds into eth, which last time fed into NFTs. Some say NFTs have followed the trajectory of bitcoin and eth when they first came out, up then down, while others so memecoins have replaced them, so whether they do have comeback power is to be seen.

The idea of funding art is sound. The problem for centuries has been doing so profitably. How do you monetize vanity? Which in some ways should be an easy question, ask Gucci, but that also means constantly re-inventing and coming up with cool.

Then there's gaming and Web3. The latter is harder, but it solves a real problem: freeing up the commons and the common pen to public ownership from the current 'dictatorship' of one king CEO.

So we've gone from finance, to industry, to art, to tech. Therefore seeing what would be said if there is an eth season is easy, but when there will be one - or god forbid even if - is for the market to tell.

URL Source: https://cryptobriefing.com/blockchain-gaming-innovation-delabs/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:50:53+00:00

Markdown Content:
Blockchain gaming is seen as a hot narrative in crypto for 2024 by different industry players, such as Binance and CoinGecko. According to the latter, the total market cap of blockchain gaming tokens is over $18.6 billion.

Delabs Games is one of the players building in this sector, focusing on an ecosystem built on the concept of assets that can be used in different games, called Asset Inventory System.

Joonmo Kwon, founder and CEO at Delabs Games, shared with Crypto Briefing his thoughts on how blockchain technology could revolutionize the gaming industry, how gamers perceive this two-sector junction, and why current traditional titles are not tapping into Web3.

**Crypto Briefing – When it comes to the traditional gaming sector, what are some stark differences you can point out compared to blockchain?**

Joonmo Kwon – One significant difference between Delabs Games and traditional gaming lies in their approach to accessibility and user experience. Delabs Games prioritizes creating fun games for everyone, including Web2 users who may not be familiar with NFTs, wallets, or crypto. Their simple onboarding process allows players to enjoy the benefits of Web3 gaming without needing extensive knowledge of blockchain technology.

In contrast, traditional gaming often lacks the concept of ownership and tangible value for players. While players may invest significant time and money into traditional games, they typically do not retain any tangible assets once the game is no longer supported. Web3 gaming, on the other hand, enables players to own digital assets that are valuable and tradable, providing a sense of ownership and lasting value.

Moreover, the psychological impact of ownership plays a crucial role in Web3 gaming. By owning in-game assets, players become more invested in the game, leading to increased engagement, loyalty, and community participation. This stands in contrast to traditional gaming, where players may feel less connected to the games they play due to the lack of ownership.

Overall, Delabs Games and Web3 gaming represent a shift towards a more sustainable and aligned relationship between game companies and players. By offering more value to players through ownership and participation, Web3 gaming disrupts the traditional gaming industry and creates a model where the interests of both the company and the player are better aligned.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

**Crypto Briefing – For a gamer not familiar with the concept of digital assets, can you explain how the Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts their gaming experience?**

A pivotal focus of AIS is its capacity to transition players from solitary game participants to platform users by immersing them in diverse gaming experiences. This is made possible by enabling assets acquired in one game to enhance performance in others. Termed ‘Player Liquidity,’ the objective is to facilitate seamless transitions between games, cultivating a vibrant platform environment.

The Asset Inventory System (AIS) lies at the core of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, offering a gamified platform crafted to facilitate the flow of player liquidity across multiple games on the platform.

AIS motivates users to explore different games through a blend of external rewards and internal satisfaction. Users are driven to gather “assets,” which can be equipped in inventory slots to enrich both their gaming journey and earnings on the platform. This inventive feature adds to the layer’s appeal, encouraging smooth transitions between games and the platform.

The Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts the gaming experience in several ways. The first is enhanced Interoperability and partnership opportunities, as AIS facilitates interoperability between the Delabs Games ecosystem and third-party projects. By suggesting new boosts and set bonuses for assets from third-party projects, the Delabs Games Playable Layer seamlessly introduces new content to platform users. This not only enriches the gaming experience but also opens up opportunities for users to fully explore third-party offerings, ultimately increasing conversion and retention rates.

The second is equipping assets for boost effects, as players can equip assets to their inventory for boost effects both in-game and on the platform. For example, assets like speed boosts in Rumble Racing Star or staking APY boosts can significantly enhance gameplay or earnings. Each asset can possess rarity, boost, and set bonuses, further diversifying the strategies players can employ to optimize their gaming experience.

A third positive impact is collecting assets, since players have various avenues to acquire assets, whether through gameplay, contributions to the platform, or ownership of digital assets within the ecosystem. These earned assets can be equipped in the inventory slots of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, providing players with a range of boost effects that enhance their in-game performance or earnings.

This incentivizes player engagement and participation, enriching the overall gaming experience while fostering a sense of ownership and progression within the ecosystem.

**Crypto Briefing – The gaming industry already has traditional titles that rely heavily upon users’ interactions and could be favored by the AIS concept, such as Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia. Why do you think none of the companies behind these titles started experimenting with that?**

AIS’s core element lies in providing a gamified platform experience. While games like Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia focus primarily on in-game experiences, the Delabs Games Playable Layer extends the gaming experience beyond just gameplay, integrating a platform-native gamified experience. This system allows users to collect and combine various assets for benefits both within individual games and across the platform.

The Delabs Games Playable Layer promotes platform composability, enabling systematic integration across games on the platform. Additionally, by starting with a curated selection of high-quality games and gradually expanding with mini-games, Delabs Games strikes a balance between game quality and accessibility, catering to various intrinsic motivations of gamers.

In contrast, traditional titles may not have experimented with similar concepts because they focus primarily on in-game experiences and may not prioritize the broader platform experience that Delabs Games aims to provide. Delabs Games emphasizes community participation, incentivizing engagement and growth through reward mechanisms and a collaborative mindset rooted in the essence of Web3.

**Crypto Briefing – Blockchain gaming is commonly overlooked by traditional gamers since it involves monetary aspects and NFTs, which are not so popular in this group. From a builder’s perspective, do you see more penetration from blockchain gaming among traditional gamers?**

Yes, there’s a noticeable shift in the perception and adoption of blockchain gaming among traditional gamers. The quality of Web3 games is steadily improving, accompanied by a diversification of genres beyond the casual and puzzle games that previously dominated the space. With expansions into genres like FPS, MMO, and RPGs, blockchain gaming is becoming more appealing to traditional gamers who seek diverse and immersive gaming experiences.

Moreover, major players in the gaming industry, including Nexon and Ubisoft, have announced their entry into Web3 game development, indicating a growing acceptance and interest in blockchain gaming among established gaming companies. Additionally, industry heavyweights like CCP Games, Ubisoft, Square Enix, Sony, and Konami are cautiously exploring the Web3 gaming landscape, further validating the potential of blockchain technology in gaming.

Crypto research firm **10x Research** on Wednesday underscored its prediction that the ongoing **Bitcoin** BTC/USD correction may take prices into [the low $50,000s.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38555886/this-trader-sees-bitcoin-dropping-to-40-000-and-still-be-fine-expect-lower-prices-but-dont)

**What Happened**: In their latest email [newsletter](https://10xresearch.co/), the team around lead analyst **Markus Thielen** highlight the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.

Their research suggests the [average entry price](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38277523/bitcoin-halving-jitters-why-10x-research-urges-caution) for U.S. Bitcoin ETF holders sits around $57,300, potentially even higher, a level Bitcoin prices are rapidly approaching.

Despite the predicted correction, 10x Research maintains a positive long-term outlook.

Bitcoin’s recent one-year high validates their early 2023 prediction of a new bull market, further reinforced by its proximity to their forecasted halving price of $63,160.

Additionally, their 2023 year-end target of $45,000 was nearly achieved, and their post-ETF approval target of $57,000, later revised to $70,000, underscores their continuous analysis and adaptation.

Their ability to accurately predict market movements stems from a deep understanding of historical trends and the driving forces within the crypto industry.

As 10x Research points out in their previous reports, analyzing these factors has been instrumental in their successful predictions throughout the current bull market.

**Why It Matters**: Looking back, the August 2023 correction was attributed to rising 10-year Treasury bond yields and a hawkish Fed stance, mirroring the situation during the August 2015 RMB devaluation.

While the initial impact was a sharp decline, Bitcoin ultimately recovered significantly by year-end.

Similar foresight was applied in January 2024, where 10x Research anticipated a correction to $36,000/$38,000, citing the historical tendency for corrections following major Bitcoin product approvals.

They recommended hedging long exposure but turned bullish again as Bitcoin rebounded, reiterating their $70,000 target.

March 2024 saw another crucial turning point.

Recognizing the potential for a +/-10% move, 10x Research established a line in the sand at $68,300, indicating a potential significant top if breached.

This aligns with their current [prediction of a correction](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38334571/why-bitcoin-could-plummet-to-52-000-10x-research) towards $52,000/$55,000 within the ongoing bull market.

Several factors contribute to this anticipated correction.

The research highlights a shift in ETF buying behavior, with six [consecutive days of outflows](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38554103/spot-bitcoin-etfs-bled-another-162-million-on-tuesday) observed.

**What’s Next**: As the average entry price of $57,300 is approached, further ETF unwinding is expected, potentially pushing prices down.

Additionally, the estimated all-in mining cost of $53,000/$55,000 for Bitcoin miners could trigger selling to protect operations.

While a 25% to 29% correction is anticipated, 10x Research acknowledges the possibility of a consolidation period instead of a sharp snapback rally.

As industry leaders gather at events like Benzinga’s [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) on Nov. 19th, insights from 10x Research and other experts will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of the current bull market and preparing for potential corrections within the broader landscape.

Here’s Why Changpeng Zhao Got a Lighter Prison Sentence 
--------------------------------------------------------

The former Binance chief has been sentenced after months of anticipation, but with an element of surprise.

*   **Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to prison.**
*   **The significantly reduced sentence CZ received has raised questions across the industry.** 
*   **Analysts have described the recent ruling as unjust.** 

Former Binance CEO [Changpeng Zhao](https://dailycoin.com/how-binances-changpeng-zhao-became-powerful-man-in-crypto/) and the U.S. Department of Justice have been embroiled in a legal tussle over the past months following his November conviction of violating anti-money laundering laws and facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals. As one of the biggest legal cases to rock the crypto industry, CZ’s conviction resulted in significant sanctions, including a [hefty $4.3 billion](https://dailycoin.com/heres-what-binances-4b-settlement-and-czs-resignation-means/) and his resignation from Binance as CEO. 

Despite the weight of the penalties, Zhao was not let off the hook, and he promised an additional hefty jail time for his conviction. Following [several months of anticipation](https://dailycoin.com/heres-what-changpeng-zhaos-delayed-sentence-means-for-him/) of his sentencing, US Judge Richard Jones finally brought the legal case to a close, albeit with a surprising twist.

CZ’s Shocking Sentence 
-----------------------

Contrasting the promised hefty sentence, Judge Jones [handed](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison-.html) CZ a mere four-month prison term for his guilty plea to violating US anti-money laundering laws.

Justifying the ruling, Judge Jones asserted that the sentence, which mocks the [3-year term recommended by prosecutors](https://dailycoin.com/u-s-doj-asks-changpeng-zhao-cz-to-be-jailed-for-3-years/) and falls below the maximum one to two years under federal laws, is appropriate for the former CEO, citing the lack of evidence that he was “informed” of the illegal activities at the exchange.

Zhao’s conduct and reputation were also focal points in his sentencing. Despite the prosecutor’s argument that he adopted an intentional ‘apology over permission’ approach to circumventing regulations, Judge Jones emphasized that he acted responsibly and displayed a modest nature.

“The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility,” stated the judge, [adding that](https://x.com/martypartymusic/status/1785385750479118774?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) “There needs to be an effort by this court to impose a sentence that’s appropriate and reasonable” 

The perceived attributes, built on Zhao’s apology and over 160 letters from his family seeking leniency, are believed to have influenced Judge Jones’s ruling, resulting in the ousted CEO receiving minimal time for his conviction.

CZ’s reduced jail time has spotlighted its stark contrast from another major legal crypto case in the United States.

How CZ’s Sentence Differs From SBF’s
------------------------------------

The Justice Department’s conviction of Channgpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) in November 2023 marked an eventual history, considering both positions as once-hailed titans of the industry.

However, while CZ’s sentence was a mere four months in jail, SBF [bagged a 25-year term](https://dailycoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-gets-25-years-heres-a-full-breakdown/) on March 28, 2024, raising a debate over the stark difference.

The severity of their charges justifies the variance in their sentencing. Unlike Zhao, whose allegations were solely focused on regulatory violations, SBF was [convicted on several counts of financial fraud](https://dailycoin.com/sbf-guilty-on-multiple-charges-awaits-sentence-in-2024/), including wire and securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  

Additionally, SBF was declared guilty of misappropriating user funds and triggering losses of over $8 billion for the users and the broader industry, a crime not present in the CZ cases. Binance has repeatedly reiterated the safety of users’ funds, providing the exchange and CEO an edge in its regulatory case.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **Changpeng Zhao’s wealth and influence have been** [**spotlighted**](https://twitter.com/jeffhauser/status/1785419246316474486?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) **as another reason for his reduced term.**
*   **One of the allegations against Binance was the facilitation of illicit transactions for terrorist organizations, and analysts have** [**decried his light sentence**](https://twitter.com/bettermarkets/status/1785390499076964742?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) **as a miscarriage of justice.**
*   **Although the sentence ended his legal battles, the former CEO could still not return to the exchange, as his** [**November ousting**](https://dailycoin.com/binance-will-be-fine-cz-pens-final-note-to-staff-as-ceo/) **was final.**

Why This Matters
----------------

A mere 120-day sentence for Changpeng Zhao constitutes a win for him by letting him off the hook easily, considering the severity of the charges for which he was convicted and the rather stringent approach the DOJ is renowned for.

*   Rootstock's new plan to bring programmability to Bitcoin could unfold over the next 12 months.

*   The project could lead to the development of layer-2 networks atop Bitcoin without requiring any major changes to the blockchain's underlying code.

*   Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine developer known for his early work on Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin stash, discussed the project Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ developer conference in Austin.


AUSTIN, TEXAS — The founder of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol [Rootstock](https://rootstock.io/) has detailed plans for a new "BitVMX" project designed to improve the oldest blockchain's programmability by keying off developer Robin Linus's much-discussed "[BitVM](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/13/bitcoin-researcher-behind-bitvm-ignites-fresh-buzz-with-new-paper-on-file-hosting/)" design unveiled last year.

Sergio Demian Lerner, a Buenos Aires-based programmer known for his early research on Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's mining activities and later for contributing to the Ethereum blockchain's development, discussed the project onstage Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ conference in Austin, Texas.

"We have a roadmap to finish this in one year" and "we are moving forward at full speed," Lerner said during the presentation.

Linus's [release of BitVM last year](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/11/bitcoin-might-get-ethereum-style-smart-contracts-under-bitvm-plan/) has been widely cited by Bitcoin developers as a breakthrough for the 15-year-old blockchain since it theoretically would facilitate the development of programmable layer-2 networks similar to those that are being used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to make transactions cheaper and faster. Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code – seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades.

Lerner had disclosed last month during an exclusive interview last week on CoinDesk's [The Protocol podcast](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-protocol/rootstock-bringing-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-bitcoin/) that he was working with colleagues on the new project without providing details.

Last week, Rootstock Labs published a [blog post](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/content-hub/announcing-bitvmx-an-advanced-computational-layer-for-bitcoin/) on the effort, arguing that "theory and practice are two very different things," referring to Linus's original concept.

"The BitVMX research team intends to build on this initial discovery with additional innovations to create an improved development framework for running programs on Bitcoin," according to the blog post. "The name is a nod to BitVMX’s origins while highlighting its focus on extending Bitcoin and accelerating the development of the next generation of sidechains and layer 2s."

Rootstock Labs added that "a team of core contributors is working on a public roadmap of proposed improvements to the network in the next 12 months."

According to an accompanying [whitepaper](https://bitvmx.org/), "BitVMX framework provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compilation toolchain" – a technical description of the new system that boils down to facilitating a "myriad of use cases."

Two figures once considered to be titans in the crypto industry are going to prison in the United States for drastically different amounts of time.

Since the sentencing hearings for former FTX CEO [Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/sam-bankman-fried-and-caroline-ellison) and former Binance CEO [Changpeng “CZ” Zhao](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/changpeng-zhao), many in and out of the crypto space have questioned why the two industry leaders have received such different treatment in the U.S. legal system. Bankman-Fried could be in his fifties by the time he leaves prison and will likely have fewer assets than Zhao, who will be out of prison by the end of the year and, according to Forbes, has an estimated net worth of $33 billion.

But let’s back up a minute.

Bankman-Fried was arrested in 2022, extradited to the United States, pleaded not guilty, given house arrest, remanded to jail after allegations of witness intimidation, prosecuted in a six-week trial, found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Zhao was charged in 2023, pleaded guilty, was allowed to remain free on bail, was sentenced to four months in prison and will surrender himself in a matter of days.

The former FTX CEO faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misuse of customer funds. CZ faced one charge related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.

“CZ was charged with a crime that is more akin to a regulatory violation: the failure to have an adequate system of Anti-Money Laundering controls, while SBF was charged with wire fraud in connection with the secret plundering of billions of dollars in crypto custody with FTX to prop up Alameda,” Mark Bini, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While both \[crimes\] are serious, SBF’s crime was far more serious.” ![Image 1: two men shaking hands in front of a t shirt](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/edece203-846c-4f01-93d8-b3e61930dfb8.png)

_Source: [Tiffany Fong](https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1785392750193746077)_

From the beginning of his legal woes, Bankman-Fried and his defense team have largely maintained that he “did what \[he\] thought was right.” In the sentencing hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan accused the former FTX CEO of lying on the stand and [described his testimony](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-years-prison-hold) as “evasive.” His first interview after the judge laid down a 25-year judgment [included SBF saying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-post-sentencing-statement): “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal.”

The facts of the case presented at trial also undermined SBF’s defense. Many government witnesses, including his former girlfriend and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, [suggested that he orchestrated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/caroline-ellison-testifies-sam-bankman-fried-trial) the misuse of FTX user funds.

In contrast, Zhao did not publicly comment on the case between U.S. authorities and Binance [since a $4.3 billion settlement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-officials-announce-binance-settlement) and his guilty plea in November 2023. He submitted hundreds of pages worth of letters from industry leaders, family members and others. Judge Richard Jones [commented on the outpouring](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-binance-sentenced-prison) of support for CZ at his sentencing hearing, adding he had “risked \[his\] entire net worth” for Binance. “Even though I believe he was guilty of much more, the DOJ didn’t have the evidence, and that’s why they could only get CZ to admit to rather light crimes,” Swan Bitcoin managing Director Terrence Yang told Cointelegraph. “Unlike SBF, \[...\] CZ didn’t fight extradition (was in a non-extradition country) and agreed to only light crimes in his plea deal. CZ is only paying $50 million in his plea deal with the DOJ.” ![Image 2: peter hahn tweets a picture of a man and a woman](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/dcf191b6-558f-4ca6-9278-e69dd9e843e7.png)

Despite speculation from many crypto users, it is doubtful that CZ and SBF will share a cell while incarcerated, let alone be housed in the same facility. Though the judge in SBF’s case suggested that he would serve in a San Francisco Bay Area prison, he may also allow the former FTX CEO to [stay in New York](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prison-appeal) during his appeal.

Dubai's crypto-friendly policies and infrastructure fuel its rise as a global innovation hub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOKEN2049, a global conference series for the crypto industry, concluded its inaugural Dubai event with resounding success despite facing unprecedented weather challenges. The conference, which took place from April 18-19 during TOKEN2049 Week, attracted a record-breaking 10,000 attendees from over 160 countries.

Torrential rains, the heaviest in the UAE’s recorded history, threatened to disrupt the event. However, the crypto community’s resilience shone through as attendees braved the elements to participate in the sold-out conference.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

&gt; “This week we witnessed the determination of the crypto industry first hand,” said Alex Fiskum, Co-Founder of TOKEN2049. “Our programme proceeded and our doors opened as planned, welcoming attendees to a comfortable, immersive, and action-packed event.”

TOKEN2049 Dubai featured an impressive lineup of over 200 industry leaders, including Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram; Richard Teng, CEO of Binance; Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether; and Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder of BitMEX.

The event was marked by significant announcements, such as Tether’s partnership with Telegram to launch USDT on The Open Network (TON), Polkadot’s introduction of a new JAM chain graypaper, Berachain’s collaboration with Google Cloud, and Telos’ partnership with Ponos Technology to develop an Ethereum L2 zkEVM network.

Looking ahead, TOKEN2049 Singapore is set to raise the bar even higher, with an expected 20,000 attendees converging at the iconic Marina Bay Sands on September 18-19, just before the Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend.

&gt; “Energized by this success, we now shift focus to prepare for the industry’s largest event of the year,” Fiskum stated.

Bitcoin has pulled back 22% from its all-time high in March. Now, on-chain intelligence company Glassnode suggests the market could be “hammering out a local bottom formation.” 

In a new [report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-18-2024/), the firm suggests that the market is currently still in a “euphoria” phase—a period in a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin. When investors are in this state, the market should expect a correction.

With [Bitcoin crashing to $57,000](https://decrypt.co/228938/bitcoin-crashes-to-57000-and-ethereum-slips-below-3000-hours-before-fed-meeting) at the time of writing, many investors believe we’re currently experiencing such a correction. But how much further will this drawback go?

Glassnode said that a good way to identify whether we've reached the local bottom is when short-term investors realize losses. Its historical data shows numerous examples from 2020 until now that show when one-week to one-month-old entities realize losses, Bitcoin’s price often begins to climb shortly after.

Carlos Mercado, data scientist at analytics company Flipside Crypto, told _Decrypt_, “I'm inclined to believe Glassnode is correctly identifying the ‘paper hands’ phenomenon within a specific cohort.”

“Paper hand” investors leave the market at the highest rate when the market is reaching its bottom. As long as the [market-value-to-realized-value](https://academy.glassnode.com/market/mvrv/mvrv-ratio) (MVRV) ratio—a measure of an asset's market cap versus the value stored in the asset—remains between 1.0 and 0.9, it has a chance to bounce back.

Fortunately, the market is within this band, providing hope that it can rebound.

“It could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation,” the report explained. “That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.”

Since the publication of this report, the price of BTC has continued to slide from $66,700 down to $57,000. Is this the beginning of the paper-hands sell-off that the report predicts? Or will it go lower?

“Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday, the closest consolidation to the current price level was in the $50,000 to $52,000 area,” senior market analyst at [FxPro](https://www.fxpro.com/) Alex Kuptsikevich explained to _Decrypt._

“A more dramatic scenario suggests a pullback to the $40,000 to $44,000 area, which would shake the weak hands out of the market before we get sustained interest from new buyers,” Kuptsikevich added.

The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate of 5.25%% to 5.5% at the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Wednesday, following a fearsome 6% drawdown in Bitcoin’s price earlier that day.

Within five minutes of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price rose from $57,300 to $57,700

*   Per a [press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm), the central bank said it also plans to slow down the rate at which it sells US Treasury securities starting in June, reducing its monthly redemption cap from $60 billion to $25 billion.
*   Market participants [overwhelmingly expected](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) the Fed to maintain its interest rate at 5.25% heading into the meeting, expecting cuts to potentially take off in Q4.
*   However, words from the central bank confirmed market fears that the central bank may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell nationwide price inflation, which remains stubbornly above 3%.
*   “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” the Fed wrote.
*   The economy also remains surprisingly resilient: data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that 81% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have filed their Q1 earnings have beaten their first-quarter expectations.
*   Bitcoin’s price is known to be influenced by central bank policy and macroeconomic liquidity conditions.  
Some analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe BTC will continue to [surge past](https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-bitcoin-btc-will-not-stop-at-100k-arthur-hayes-live-from-token2049/) $100,000 as central bank balance sheets continue to expand.

*   **Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose.**
*   **This comes as crypto traders lose $400M following Bitcoin’s crash to $56K.**
*   **Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s long-term outperformance compared to traditional assets.**

While crypto investors shoulder substantial losses over the past day amid the market retracement, renowned [Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor](https://coinedition.com/michael-saylors-bitcoin-leveraged-strategy-transforming-1-income-to-400m-profit/) took to X to reassure enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains the essential asset they cannot afford to overlook. In his words, “Bitcoin is for the money you can’t afford to lose.”

Saylor’s commentary comes amid Bitcoin’s price correction in the past few days, culminating in the asset revisiting the $56K range. At the press time value of $57,568, BTC is trading at one of its lowest points in the two months.

Following the asset’s substantial crash in the last few hours, at least 141K crypto traders who had placed bets on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory have been liquidated, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million. Nonetheless, Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, remains confident that this downturn should be less concerning for Bitcoin investors.

The short video accompanying Saylor’s tweet illustrated Bitcoin’s performance over the past eight years compared to various traditional investments, including the S&amp;P 500, Gold, U.S. real estate, U.S. dollar, Nigerian Naira, Turkish Lira, and Argentine Peso.

It depicted that while Bitcoin maintained an over 100% gain year-on-year since 2016, these other investments struggled to attain comparable returns.

For instance, in 2019, Gold and U.S. real estate saw significant gains of around 20%. However, these gains gradually diminished over the years to single-digit percentages. At the same time, currencies like the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso experienced crashes, plummeting to as low as 0.001%.

These outcomes have solidified Saylor’s belief that Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose. Responding to Saylor’s sentiment, X user AfriBull [remarked](https://x.com/Afri_bull/status/1785439846745493906), “Bitcoin has become the ultimate hedge against fiat volatility globally.”

As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.25-5.50%.

Also pretty much as expected, [the FOMC acknowledged](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm) that progress on lower inflation has stalled this year and said it wouldn't be appropriate to trim rates until it has greater confidence inflation is moving "sustainably" towards 2%.

CZ's 4-Month Sentence Seems 'Minimal' for the Crime Committed: Legal Expert


The price of bitcoin [(BTC)](https://coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"BitcoinPrice|BTCPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") has bounced modestly in the minutes since the news hit, but remains under pressure, down more than 4% for the session at $58,000.

In addition to the rate news, the FOMC announced it is slowing the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. Other things being equal, the move is likely to boost risk appetite and asset prices, wrote economist Joseph Brusuelas.

Markets came into 2024 expecting a long series of rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, but those hopes have been whittled down sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to show strength and inflation has actually risen a bit in the year's first four months. According [the CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing in a nearly 25% chance of zero rate cuts this year. One month ago, there was just a 1% chance of no Fed easing in 2024.

That change in expectations has weighed a bit on traditional markets, with the Nasdaq lower by about 5% since hitting its 2024 high about three weeks ago and the S&amp;P 500 off by a similar amount since touching its year-to-date high in late March. It's also likely contributed to the plunging bitcoin price, which is now down more than 20% from its record high from mid-March above $73,000.

A check of traditional markets shortly after the FOMC announcement, finds stocks remaining little-changed and the dollar and bond yields slightly lower. Gold is up 0.5% at $2,316 per ounce but remains about 4% down from its record high above $2,400 hit in mid-April.

Further clues to the Fed's thinking will come shortly as Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m ET.

Digital securities platform Securitize has raised $47 million in a new strategic funding round led by BlackRock. Blockchain developers Aptos Labs and Paxos, and stablecoin issuer Circle, were also among the investors.

Proceeds from the funding round will be used for product development, global expansion and strengthening partnerships in the financial services ecosystem, Securitize [said](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/securitize-announces-47-million-strategic-funding-round-led-by-blackrock-302133075.html) in a statement.

BlackRock global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom will join the Securitize board of directors. Chalom called the investment in Securitize “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy \[…\] that will help meet the future needs of our clients." ![Image 2: a twittee with the words'security' and confetti](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/9e8955bd-4bc7-4ed4-944b-69b0f0d20a5e.png)

Securitize partnered with BlackRock as a transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent on the March launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first tokenized fund.

BUIDL invests in cash, United States Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, and pays dividends accrued daily through a monthly deposit of tokens stably worth $1. BUIDL holders have the option to transfer their shares to Circle in exchange for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)) stablecoin.

In the six weeks of its existence, BUIDL amassed a market cap of $375 million to become the largest tokenized treasury fund, surpassing the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI) by $7 million. There is currently $1.28 billion locked in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, [according](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries) to RWA.xyz.

Investment manager Hamilton Lane, which has worked with Securitize since 2022, also contributed to the fundraise, along with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. Aptos Labs co-founder and CEO Mo Shaikh told Cointelegraph:

&gt; “Aptos Labs is \[…\] a key participant in closing the gap between traditional finance and open finance in a very real and globally accessible way. With leaders like BlackRock and pioneers like Securitize at the helm, there’s no doubt that a significant piece of the future of finance will play out onchain.” Securitize is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as broker-dealer and transfer agent and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) self-regulatory organization. **_Magazine: [Crypto City: Guide to San Francisco Bay Area](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-city-guide-san-francisco-bay-area/)_**

Over $340 million of long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.

Crypto markets continued to slide on Wednesday morning, hours before the Federal Reserve is due to release its interest rate decision.

Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $57,000, its lowest level since late February, after dropping 6% over the past 24 hours.

Ether (ETH) traded as low as $2,820, while Dogecoin (DOGE) slid by 8%. Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) both suffered losses of about 7%.

![Image 1: ETH Price chart](https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F6oftkxoa%2Fproduction%2F2dab1fd78d723535846217793884369a37e60158-806x475.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=100)

CoinGlass [reported](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) that over $421 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with over $349 million of these liquidated future positions being long. Being long on an asset means betting that its price will go up, while being short on it means betting that it will go down.

Markus Thielen, CEO and head analyst of 10x Research, believes that Bitcoin may drop to $52,000. “The primary driver for the recent Bitcoin price rally was the inflow of funds into Bitcoin ETFs, which has now dried up over the past 4-5 weeks. The market internals have become weaker,” he said in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thielen10x/status/1785454835191701566) on X.

Wall Street awaits Fed rate decision
------------------------------------

Stock markets slipped on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision.

Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 market index decreased by 0.51%, while Nasdaq 100 futures saw a drop of 0.82%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also experienced a decline of 0.26%.

MicroStrategy (MSTR), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw a 5% drop. Coinbase (COIN), a major cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a 3.5% loss.

Mining stocks continue to be pummeled. Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) saw their share values fall by 3.2% and 3.5%, respectively.

The U.S. central bank will release its rate policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, following which Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong debut of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs didn't make a big splash on their first day, with a trading volume of just over $11 million.

Yet, considering the relatively smaller size of the Hong Kong ETF market compared to the U.S., ETF analyst Eric Balchunas [noted](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1785283076802707563) that the debut was more successful than perceived."If you localize numbers, this was big," Balchunas said.
