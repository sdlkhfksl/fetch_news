Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price trajectory has fueled speculation and uncertainty, particularly as the cryptocurrency struggles amidst a three-day losing streak. Currently hovering around $57,280, with an intraday low of $56,750, [Bitcoin’s performance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) in the market remains lackluster.

This decline coincides with broader market movements, with the global crypto market cap slumping by 6.4%, standing at $2.22 trillion presently. Investors are closely eyeing the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision, reflecting apprehension about its potential impact on cryptocurrency investments.

Bitcoin Price Drops Pre-FOMC Meeting Amid USD Strength
------------------------------------------------------


[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-passes-the-63000-mark-once-more-time-to-buy.htm)‘s price has declined over the last three days ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with investors bracing for a potentially hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) stance. The Federal Reserve’s policy committee is expected to affirm a cautious and gradual strategy towards reducing interest rates in 2024. However, greater focus may be placed on the Fed’s plans regarding its balance sheet.

The CME FedWatch Tool indicates a mere 4.4% chance of a rate cut, with 95.6% anticipating rates to remain steady between 525 and 550 basis points.  The Federal Open Market Committee will wrap up its two-day April policy meeting today and announce its decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will then speak at a press conference starting at 2:30 p.m. Futures markets have largely priced in the likelihood of no adjustment to interest rates during this meeting.

*   [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=As%20more%20and%20more%20people,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.), now trading around $56,500, has plunged over 7% in 24 hours amid renewed economic uncertainty.
*   Investor sentiment leans towards the Fed refraining from rate cuts this year, adversely affecting assets like cryptocurrencies.
*   The US dollar has strengthened on upbeat Employment Cost Index data and Fed officials’ remarks signalling no immediate rate cut necessity, exacerbating pressure on BTC prices and the crypto market overall.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
------------------------

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) (BTC/USD) encountered a substantial decline. It is now priced at $57,332, reflecting a 6.4% downturn. The pivotal price levels and indicators are essential to the technical landscape. At present, the pivot point rests at $59,008, with immediate resistance observed at $61,569, followed by subsequent hurdles at $64,654 and $67,084.

Noteworthy indicators include an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 25, signalling a potential reversal, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50 EMA) positioned at $63,473, potentially acting as resistance.

Below the pivotal level of $59,008, the outlook remains bearish, with a breakthrough indicating a shift towards a more bullish sentiment, while a failure may reinforce the prevailing bearish bias. Traders should closely monitor these levels for strategic decision-making.

![Image 1: Bitmart Confirms it Will List Mollars ($MOLLARS) token](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01130339/1714568618-mollars-tokens-x.jpg)

Mollars token presale has had an exhilarating 2024, becoming the top  verifiable cryptocurrency initial coin offering. Transparent with their ICO wallet addresses, every bit of the 1.2-million-dollars raised thus far is able to be verified by investors as it [surpasses 67% sold out](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ethereum-blockchain-s-mollars-token-pre-sale-achieves-65-sold-out/ar-AA1nMjNB?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds).   Now, the store of value token for Ethereum Blockchain has extended the presale,  allowing Bitmart crypto exchange the time to confirm its launch on their CEX.

“#BitMart is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Mollars token (MOLLARS) @mollarstoken” wrote the popular crypto exchange on X \[fka twitter\]. 9-Million Crypto Traders Confirmed To Get Access to Mollars ----------------------------------------------------------- The prominent cryptocurrency exchange has over 9-million users internationally and is the first to confirm that Mollars token will launch. With just a total token supply of just 10-million, perhaps the one exchange would be enough to exhaust all whole $MOLLARS tokens. [![Image 2](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/27143252/1714228372-mollars-banner.gif)](http://www.mollars.com/)

Regardless, it’s not the only exchange set to list Mollars. According to [an official reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mollarstoken/comments/1cha2w4/bitmart_has_agreed_to_list_mollars_token_listing/), multiple exchanges have already confirmed they will list the new Bitcoin rival.   Due to the policy of CEXES however, the names cannot be released before the token has launched.

The listings come with a slight price however;  Mollars token has had to push back their launch date to the end of the month, May 31st.  

Reason for ICO Extension
------------------------


The pullback will allow crypt investors more time to invest in the new cryptocurrency during its initial coin offering stage but also help ensure the liquidity pool is $1-million-dollars or as close to it as possible.

This token presale has a hard cap of $2-million-dollars, which will be distributed between liquidity pool and brand development according to the tokenomics report \[via Mollars.com\]. Crypto News Youtube show host, ‘_Ari_,’ did a review on the Mollars tokenomics calling the structure legitimate and showing potential for an ‘explosive’ token growth; possibly a 20x in ROI yields for ICO investors.. Other reasons cited for the extension include the loss of 45 days during the ICO. Earlier, domain registry shell company “NJAL.LA,” which is owned by one of the cofounders of SilkRoad, attempted to hijack Mollars.com. The action was quickly reversed after CryptoNews.com put out [a report on the situation](https://cryptonews.com/news/domain-registry-company-finesses-new-bitcoin-rival-out-of-their-com.htm), including names of parties involved. 

Before the situation, Mollars token presale was averaging around 90,000 token sales per day.   It tools nearly 1.5 months for the ICO to reach similar averages.

Today, Mollars initial coin offering is back to its normal pre-sales totals.   Crypto investors bought nearly $28,000 \[9.3ETH\] of $MOLLARS tokens in the last 24 hours alone. If the these stats continue, excluding weekends, Mollars should raise over $650,000 between now and the May 31st deadline; Enough to put the ICO very close to hard cap. This would help solidify the store-of-value token’s liquidity pool and maximize the token’s price potential on listing day.

The well-known American magazine Forbes described 20 altcoins as zombies, including XRP, Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

Forbes, a well-known American magazine with a history of more than 100 years, recently published a striking report.

Although Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins are becoming more used and adopted day by day, Forbes described some blockchains and altcoins as “zombies”.

Mentioning 20 altcoins, Forbes also included popular altcoins such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classis (ETC).

According to Forbes, these altcoins do not meet traditional measures of success, exhibiting minimal utility and user adoption.

It was stated that the common feature of these altcoins is that they do not have any practical denominator and a significant user base. Forbes argues that all of these altcoins have a speculative structure.

These altcoins were listed as follows: XRP, ADA, LTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Internet Computer (ICP), ETC, Stellar (XLM), Stacks (STX), Kaspa (KAS), Theta (THETA), Phantom (FTM) , Monero (XMR), Arweave (AR), Algorand (ALGO), Flow (FLOW), MultiversX (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Mina (MINA), Tezos (XTZ) and Eos (EOS).

[Shiba Inu](https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium) is currently one step away from a potential catastrophe, as it faces potential selling pressure that could theoretically push it below $0.00001. The asset has recently landed on a strong support level at $0.000021, as indicated by the blue line on the chart. This level is crucial for Shiba Inu’s short-term stability, and any breach below could intensify selling pressure.

Currently, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average is playing a pivotal role in providing support to the price. This technical indicator often acts as a psychological barrier for traders and can either bolster buying confidence or, if broken, lead to increased selling. If [Shiba Inu's](https://u.today/billions-of-shiba-inu-shib-by-coinbase-in-24-hours-whats-happening) price falls below this EMA, it will encounter the next major [support](https://u.today/peter-brandt-predicts-bitcoin-bull-run-till-2025-shiba-inu-team-gives-crucial-statement-on) at the 200-day EMA.

![Image 2: SHIBUSDT](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/image_740.png)

[SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)

Unfortunately, if the price breaks down below the 200-day EMA, the next significant level of support is notably lower, below $0.00001. Such a move would practically negate the uptrend Shiba Inu has enjoyed throughout 2024, possibly resetting market expectations and investor sentiment around the asset.

In terms of resistance, [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-outshines-doge-and-pepe-in-this-key-metric) faces immediate barriers at $0.0000228 and $0.0000245. These levels represent short-term goals for the asset to reclaim to sustain its bullish momentum. Overcoming these could push the asset back into bullish territory and rekindle investor interest, potentially leading to a price surge. It would also mark the recovery of the cryptocurrency market in general.

Looking ahead, the future of Shiba Inu is tied to its ability to maintain above these critical support levels. A sustained breakdown below $0.000021 could trigger a cascade of selling, weakening recent gains and aggravating the sentiment surrounding the meme coin.

URL Source: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T09:00:37-05:00

Markdown Content:
In a statement on X that counters the prevailing wisdom among crypto enthusiasts, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently expressed reservations about the reliance on [hardware wallets](https://bitcoinist.com/why-you-need-a-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/) for securing digital assets.  
Buterin’s commentary emerged during a broader conversation on crypto security, which featured insights from several leading figures from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Why The Ethereum Founder Doesn’t Use Hardware Wallets
-----------------------------------------------------

The debate illuminated the complexities of digital asset security and showcased a range of opinions on how best to protect these assets. Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, [pointed out](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) the inherent risks associated with hardware wallets. He emphasized the potential personal errors that can undermine the security of such devices.

[![Image 1: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574255857788&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=b5146410b385bd7f90c11f7bd4fe609db836e118&amp;location=)

“Counterpoint: when using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself. Beware of the footguns: Someone finds your stashed seed, You hide the seed so well you forget, You put the seed in a bank safety deposit then hastily move overseas due to covid,” Watts commented, reflecting a critical vulnerability — human error, which can lead to significant security breaches even with robust technological safeguards.

Responding to these concerns, Buterin [elaborated](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) on his personal approach to crypto security. He stated, “The above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for &gt;90% of my personal funds. M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.”

Buterin’s approach involves a [multisig configuration](https://bitcoinist.com/poly-network-hacker-returns-stolen-funds-after-requesting-a-multisig-wallet/), which requires multiple keys to authorize transactions, thereby dispersing the risk and reducing the chances of theft or loss due to a single point of failure.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574255858710&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=e277bddf5d2cdfa84c753a8571d793718d19c601&amp;location=)

During the discussion, tobbykitty.eth proposed an alternative method known as Shamir’s Secret Sharing, a cryptographic scheme that divides a secret into multiple parts. He argued for its benefits in eliminating the need to trust others during the recovery phase, asserting that this method allows full control over the cryptographic keys without involving others.

However, Buterin countered this suggestion, pointing out the practical difficulties associated with implementing Shamir’s Secret Sharing correctly, noting, “It’s way easier to screw up than a multisig.” He also cautioned about the practical use of Shamir’s method.

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574256017489&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=7bcc416476e7ac0bf824a7dbe48c782426347c00&amp;location=)

“It depends who’s storing the shamir shares! I think the questions (i) ‘trust your other devices’ vs ‘trust your friends’ (ii) shamir vs multisig are orthogonal,” Buterin concluded. Thus, he underscored the complexity and potential for user error inherent in implementing Shamir’s method effectively.

The starting point of the debate was a post by Kofi, associated with gasfees.io. He provided a real-world perspective on the importance of using hardware wallets despite their potential drawbacks. He vividly described the emotional and financial impact of losing significant crypto holdings and advocated for the use of hardware wallets as a fundamental component of a comprehensive security strategy.

He said, “Buy a hardware wallet today and start using it ASAP. Send a little ETH to your hardware wallet from your hot wallet ([Metamask](https://bitcoinist.com/defi-bull-indicator-metamask-over-30-million/), Phantom, Rainbow .etc). Then move the majority of your funds to your hardware wallet, everything you won’t critically need for the next few days. Store the wallet somewhere safe.”

Kofi’s advice reflects a pragmatic approach to crypto security, emphasizing the importance of protecting against online threats. However, he later also acknowledged in response to the Ethereum founder that investors with a large portion of their net worth in cryptocurrencies should consider using a multisig wallet. “With a multisig, multiple keys (can be a combination of hardware and hot wallets) are needed to sign any transaction,” he added.

At press time, the Ethereum price was at $2,916.

![Image 1: Longs liquidated as Ethereum wraps up the month with over 6% loss](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _Ethereum has dropped below the $3,000 price range._
*   _ETH supply in profit dropped by around five million._

The [Ethereum \[ETH\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/) market witnessed a substantial price downturn as trading activity concluded on the 30th of April. This decline had notable repercussions on several key metrics associated with the asset.

#### **Ethereum falls 6%**

AMBCrypto’s analysis of [Ethereum](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-3360-rejection-how-much-is-profit-taking-to-blame/) revealed a negative conclusion to April, marked by a significant price drop.

On the 30th of April, ETH experienced a decline of 6.29%, trading at approximately $3,013, just managing to hold onto the $3,000 price level.

However, as of the latest update, the decline persisted, pushing Ethereum below the $3,000 threshold. Its price was around $2,972 at press time. 

[![Image 2: Ethereum price trend](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201793%20689'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD_2024-05-01_07-44-39.png)

Initially, Ethereum seemed poised to breach its short-term moving average (yellow line), which acted as resistance in the $3,300 to $3,500 range.

However, the recent downturn has pushed it further away from this target, and forced Ethereum to cross another significant threshold on its Relative Strength Index (RSI).

At press time, ETH dipped below 40 on the RSI, signaling a strong bearish trend.

#### **Longs feel the heat of the dip**

AMBCrypto’s analysis of [Ethereum’s](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-returns-to-bear-trend-amidst-whale-induced-sell-offs/) liquidation chart on [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/ETH) revealed a notable surge in liquidation volume on the 30th of April.

The king of altcoins witnessed its highest liquidation volume in weeks, totaling over $115 million by the end of trading that day.

Further examination of the chart highlighted that long positions bore the brunt of the liquidation, accounting for approximately $97.4 million. In comparison, short positions contributed $18.11 million to the total.

This spike in long liquidation marked the most significant volume seen in weeks, signifying that traders who had taken long positions or anticipated an increase in Ethereum’s price had their positions forcibly closed.

#### **Possible reasons for the Ethereum decline**

There has been discussion surrounding the Hong Kong ETFs launched on the 30th of April, with some observers [expressing disappointment](https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1785283289558765653) in their performance, citing low volume.

Figures indicated a total volume of around $12.7 million, with Bitcoin comprising over $9.7 million and Ethereum over $3 million. 

However, [contrasting views](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1785330193315373352) suggest that the volume was decent and not a failure, as suggested by other observers. The sluggish start contributed to the negative movement in Ethereum’s price. 

Additionally, concerns about the Federal Reserve potentially maintaining its hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on the 1st of May may have fueled the decline.

With no expectations of a rate cut due to persistent inflation in the US economy, the crypto market has historically exhibited declines leading up to FOMC meetings as investors exercise caution in anticipation of policy shifts.

#### **Ethereum supply in profit declines**

[Ethereum’s](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-to-outshine-btc-this-summer-raoul-pals-bold-prediction/) supply in profit revealed a sharp decline. Per AMBCrypto’s analysis via Santiment, between the 28th and the 30th of April, ETH’s supply in profit dropped from over 87% to approximately 83%.

This shift indicated a decrease in volume from over 119 million to around 114 million ETH. It suggested that more holders were increasingly retaining their ETH assets at a loss as the price continued to decline.

Yuga Labs CEO [Greg Solano](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/greg-solano) faced a challenging day, as he conveyed to company employees in a message subsequently shared with the public.

Following an all-hands meeting where layoffs were disclosed, some staff members experienced an even tougher time. Solano attributed Yuga’s struggles to losing its original direction.

CoinFund's Ginns on Crypto, Real Yields Correlation

In his internal communication, Solano reflected on his two-month tenure as CEO, lamenting the erosion of the company’s creative ethos:

“The creative-first spirit that drove this company from inception has been getting muddied by labyrinthine corporate processes.

“We work hard and we care but somehow end up with groups and committees.

“We plan more than we ship.”  
“Creator royalties were thriving and made our whole ecosystem electric. Now we’re in hard mode,” Solano said, but he has a plan.

Solano outlined initial steps in the restructuring, citing the spinout of HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara on April 17.

Yuga’s gaming properties were acquired by game developer Faraway, with Yuga’s chief gaming officer Spencer Tucker joining them.

Solano’s message on April 26 emphasized Yuga’s focus on developing its Otherside metaverse project.

Shortly before Solano’s announcement, Won Kim was appointed as Yuga’s head of brand partnerships. Kim, co-founder of the Bored Room Ventures NFT fund and consulting agency, left his previous position for Yuga.

The X crypto community had mixed reactions to the layoffs, though Solano’s post garnered overwhelming support.

Amidst supportive responses, there were also dissenting voices. One individual, Ricefarmer, claimed to have been laid off from Yuga Labs and highlighted their former role as a Discord moderator.

Yuga Labs, known for pioneering NFT collectibles, has faced challenges amid market evolution. In October, the company underwent restructuring, which included a round of layoffs.

When approached for further comment, Yuga Labs declined to provide additional information.

The firm's head of digital assets research links Bitcoin's downturn to US inflation and ETF outflows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stubborn inflation, the unlikelihood of near-term rate cuts, and cooling demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – all of these factors could prolong Bitcoin’s price correction to $50,000, according to Standard Chartered.

&gt; “BTC’s proper break below $60K has now reopened a route to the $50-52K range,” Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered [told](https://www.theblock.co/post/291908/standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-fall-50000) The Block, adding that the downward trend is attributed to a mix of crypto-specific factors and broader economic conditions.

Bitcoin’s ongoing price decline coincides with a series of outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the lukewarm reception of similar products in Hong Kong.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

Kendrick points out that liquidity measures in the US have deteriorated, which negatively affects assets like cryptos that typically benefit from high liquidity environments.

The backdrop of strong US inflation and the reduced likelihood of Fed rate cuts are further contributing to tightening liquidity, impacting investment flows into riskier assets like Bitcoin, he noted.

[Bitcoin wobbles ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-fed-rate-impact/). Yesterday, Bitcoin’s price plunged as low as $59,500 and [extended its correction to $57,000](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-prices-drop-fed-meeting/) earlier this morning in the lead-up to the Fed’s key decision.

Kendrick suggests that a potential re-entry into Bitcoin could be considered in the $50,000 to $52,000 range, especially if upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data proves to be favorable, potentially easing some macroeconomic pressures.

&gt; “Of course, liquidity matters when it matters, but with a backdrop of strong U.S. inflation data and less likelihood of Fed rate cuts, it matters at the moment,” he explained. “Re-enter BTC in the $50-52k range or if US CPI on the 15th is friendly.”

Standard Chartered doubles down on its $150,000 price target by year-end
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kendrick stated in an interview with Bloomberg BNN last month that [Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by the end of this year](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-price-forecast-standard-chartered/) and rise to $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Despite the current market dynamics, he reaffirmed these price targets for 2024 and 2025. The analyst told The Block that while progress might be slow at first, a significant rally could be expected closer to the anticipated Trump election victory, particularly from September through to the end of the year.

[Ross Ulbricht](https://u.today/silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-turns-40-with-11-years-spent-behind-bars) is the founder of the ill-famed darkweb marketplace The Silk Road shut down in 2013 after running for two years under Ulbricht’s leadership. Having spent more than a decade in prison already, he has tweeted that now, the US authorities may deprive him of the connection to the crypto community – social media presence.

Ulbricht announced that he may be deprived on his voice on social media soon. According to his tweet, the Bureau of Prisons is considering preventing prisoners from using any social media in the future even those who have accounts run by their close relatives.

The founder of The Silk Road confessed that he is afraid of being unable to write into the X platform any more to share his life with the crypto community. Thus, he fears he may be silenced in prison until the end of his life.

&gt; I may lose my voice soon. I found out the Bureau of Prisons is thinking of preventing prisoners from having any social media presence (even those who have an account entirely run by a loved one, like mine).
&gt; 
&gt; I’m scared I won’t be able to share my life with you anymore.

The cryptocurrency community has expressed their concerns and support to Ulbricht over this development.

Ulbricht has recently celebrated his 40th birthday after having spent 11 years behind bars. He was given two life-time sentences without a change of parole.

He often uses his X account to share the details of his life inside prison with his followers and well-wishers.

Earlier this year, former “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver emphasized the [importance of Ulbricht](https://u.today/roger-ver-issues-crucial-ross-ulbricht-bitcoin-btc-x-post) and The Silk Road for early Bitcoin adoption – all the illegal trade, a lot of which was about trading illicit drugs, was powered by BTC as new form of money not controlled by the US government.

As reported by U.Today, Roger Ver was arrested in Spain yesterday on charges of tax evasion in the US. He is now awaiting to be extradited to the US.

URL Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-l2-runes-btc-network

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:55:18.000Z

Markdown Content:
The need for Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) solutions has become more apparent than ever following the [launch of the Runes protocol](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/runes-supporters-unlock-bitcoins-potential/). 

Runes are a new Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) token standard allowing users to create fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. They were created by Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, which [enabled Bitcoin nonfungible tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals).

While notable, Runes’ popularity has [resulted in astronomical Bitcoin transaction fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miners-reap-bitcoin-runes-fees) and unprecedented network congestion.

A Dune Analytics [dashboard](https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/runes) shows that millions of Runes transactions have been processed, [accounting for 68% of all Bitcoin transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-runes-make-up-68-of-all-transactions-since-launch) made since the protocol launched.

According to [research](https://assets.bitcoinlayersreport.com/Bitcoin%20Layers%20Report_%20Tapestry%20of%20a%20Trustless%20Financial%20Era%20-%20Dec%202023%20Edition.pdf) from blockchain asset management firm Spartan Group, the introduction of Ordinals resulted in Bitcoin fees increasing as much as 280% year-to-date by December 2023.

The report notes that this marked heightened activity on the Bitcoin network, reflecting demand for Bitcoin [L2 scaling solutions](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions).

Rena Shah, vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, told Cointelegraph, “641,668 Bitcoin transactions occurred on Bitcoin because users wanted to etch Runes and make their BTC productive. Transaction bloat is the canary for Bitcoin builders in the coal mine. It’s time for L2s to scale in the direction users are going.”

Shah believes that a “Bitcoin L2 summer” is unfolding, which will result in an influx of scaling solutions.

“Similarly, when Ethereum transaction fees became unbearable for daily use, the community quickly embraced L2s,” she added.

**_Recent: [Changpeng Zhao four-month prison sentence lighter than expected](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-sentence-binance)_**

Daniel Fogg, CEO of Rootstock Labs, told Cointelegraph that while Bitcoin can handle Runes’ increased activity, the main chain fees present an opportunity for L2s that can successfully scale the network and expand its functionality.

“Runes (like Ordinals and inscriptions) have brought excitement back to the idea of building on Bitcoin. But if you are going to build a new economy, storing and transferring value are not enough. You need Turing-complete smart contracts, developer tools and much more,” he added.

Bitcoin L2s in development
--------------------------

Given these needs, a number of Bitcoin L2 solutions are coming to fruition.

For example, Fogg said that Rootstock is a Bitcoin L2 solution that combines the security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum.

Rootstock falls into Spartan Group’s “Big Four” category for emerging Bitcoin L2 solutions. According to Spartan Group’s Bitcoin Layers Report, Rootstock brought [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-an-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-and-how-does-it-work)\-compatible smart contracts to Bitcoin through its RSK Virtual Machine, known as RVM. The report notes, “With RVM, developers can port Ethereum contracts on top of Bitcoin.”

Fogg noted that Rootstock is one of the longest-running Bitcoin sidechains, with over $460 million [bridged](https://defillama.com/bridged) in total value locked.

“Over 60% of the hashing power of Bitcoin secures Rootstock through its unique merged mined consensus mechanism. Even Bitcoin’s latest halving block contained a Rootstock tag,” Fogg remarked.

The Stacks network, which launched in January 2021, is another well-known Bitcoin L2. The Stacks Bitcoin L2 uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism that runs parallel to and reuses the computational power of [Bitcoin’s proof-of-work](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained) consensus.

Shah said that while Stacks has been in development for years, the network will soon receive a major upgrade that will finally make it a usable Bitcoin L2.

She said, “The Stacks Nakamoto is a major upcoming upgrade for the Stacks layer, making it faster and more secure.”

Specifically speaking, Shah explained that the upgrade will create faster block times, Bitcoin finality and [miner extractable value](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-mev-ethereums-invisible-tax) upgrades.

“With these changes, Stacks is moving into a true, usable L2 category that unlocks BTC capital from the layer-1 for use in L2 apps. Think DeFi \[decentralized finance\], Web3 identities, real-world assets and more. $1 trillion in BTC capital can finally shift from a passive asset to a productive asset,” said Shah. More Bitcoin L2s underway ------------------------- While Rootstack and Stacks are some of the longest-standing Bitcoin L2s, Fogg believes that [more solutions are on the horizon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-layer-2s-among-catalysts-bull-cycle-bitcoin-og-says).

Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cointelegraph that he estimates at least 40 Bitcoin L2s have recently been announced.

“I’ve been following this space closely and have come across a few websites that list emerging Bitcoin L2s,” said Zamyatin.

Zamyatin added that BOB — a hybrid L2 solution — will launch its mainnet on May 1.

“BOB combines Bitcoin features with the innovation capabilities of Ethereum like EVM, smart contracts and self-custody Web3 wallets,” he said.

Bitcoin L2s create more use cases
---------------------------------

While these innovations will likely positively impact the Bitcoin network, it’s important to understand their impact on Runes.

Knut Arne Vinger, chief technology officer and co-founder of Coinweb Labs, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin L2 solutions can extend Runes’ functionality, making them more composable with other Bitcoin data. This is important, as it’s been noted that Runes are currently [akin to memecoins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-opportunity-bitcoin-runes-after-first-wave-investor-hype) with little, if any, utility.

Yet Vinger explained that a Coinweb reactive smart contract can be used to monitor transactions involving Runes to add mechanisms such as collateralization and other incentive mechanisms to extend use cases.

“Coinweb is about to activate its unifying L2 computation layer on top of Bitcoin, which will allow users to run smart contracts on Bitcoin using their existing Bitcoin wallets. We believe that this, combined with mechanisms for settlement in native Bitcoin, will be a game changer,” he said.

**_Recent: [Q-Day approaching: Can Ethereum survive a quantum emergency?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-quantum-emergency-cryptography)_**

Fogg added that other Bitcoin L2 solutions are focused on creating [stronger, safer bridges to Bitcoin using BitVM](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bitvm-whitepaper-computation-smart-contracts). ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus announced BitVM in a white paper titled “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” on Oct. 9, 2023. BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin’s consensus rules.

“This opens up the possibility of developing optimistic rollups connected to Bitcoin,” said Fogg. “Most of the L2s that have published white papers or launched testnets in recent months are doing some variant of this.”

However, Fogg warned that many Bitcoin L2 solutions being developed today may just be for hype.

“Rootstock’s view is that in order to be considered a Bitcoin L2, the blockchain must use BTC as its native asset, use Bitcoin as a settlement mechanism to enforce transactions and demonstrate a functional dependence on Bitcoin. Everything else is just affinity marketing,” he remarked.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/tokenized-real-world-assets-nears-8-billion-in-value-as-demand-grows/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:53:22+00:00

Markdown Content:
The total value locked (TVL) in Real-World Assets ([RWA](https://finbold.com/guide/real-world-asset-tokenization-vs-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network/)) has seen explosive growth over the last year, with the TVL surging to $8 billion.

The Real-World Assets sector has experienced substantial growth over the past year, with new protocols emerging that broaden the range of tokenizable assets. This expansion has propelled the TVL from approximately $2 billion at the start of 2023 to nearly $8 billion.

According to a detailed [analysis](https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1785448731803807800) by _Messari_ released in May, [stablecoins](https://finbold.com/guide/stablecoins/) like [USDC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/) and [USDT](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/tether/) have dominated asset tokenization, representing the bulk of on-chain tokenized assets. 

### Picks for you

However, the landscape began to shift significantly over the past year with the advent of protocols aimed at broadening the spectrum of tokenized assets. This expansion has been pivotal in increasing the TVL to almost $8 billion now.

Real-world assets growth and demand
-----------------------------------

RWA protocols offer exposure either to off-chain interest rates or to the price movements of non-interest-bearing assets. They are further categorized by the nature of the investment—either as debt or equity—each carrying distinct risk and return profiles. The clear trend is toward protocols that provide stable and high returns, with debt instruments particularly favored due to their lower volatility and straightforward yield generation.

The decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://finbold.com/guide/liquidity-mining-definition/)) analytics platform [_DeFiLlama_](https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA) supports these findings but reports a slightly lower TVL of $6 billion. Despite the discrepancy, both sources underscore a monumental 700% growth in protocol TVL since the beginning of 2023, painting a picture of rapidly increasing market interest and investment in these types of assets.

Not only has the total value locked seen impressive growth, but the number of active users on RWA protocols has also risen markedly since February, signaling a boost in popularity among smaller retail investors, according to _Dune Analytics_. Protocols like the digital carbon market platforms Toucan and KlimaDAO, and the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced significant user growth.

One of the key growth areas within RWA protocols is the focus on yield-bearing assets, designed to bridge the gap between off-chain yields and on-chain users. The divergence between on-chain and off-chain yields, especially noticeable during periods of rising interest rates, has renewed interest in these tokenization models.

Protocols like MakerDAO, which uses U.S. Treasury bills as collateral for its [DAI](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/dai/) stablecoin, and others such as Ondo and Mountain Protocol, are significant contributors to this segment. These platforms have helped stabilize the yield-bearing stablecoin market, despite it being a smaller part of the RWA ecosystem with just over $1 billion in TVL.

Consumer trends and investments
-------------------------------

Despite the diverse offerings within the RWA market, consumer trends show a pronounced preference for yield-bearing assets, which now account for over 90% of the sector’s TVL. This preference is further highlighted by the minimal market traction of non-yield-bearing assets like tokenized [gold](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-gold-with-a-credit-card/) and real estate, suggesting that the market is skewed towards investments that offer direct returns.

The world’s largest tokenized treasury fund, [BlackRock’s Ethereum-based Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund](https://finbold.com/is-blackrock-investing-in-rwa-tokens-heres-what-we-know/) (BUIDL), and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) have made significant contributions to the RWA sector’s expansion. These funds have not only attracted substantial capital but have also set new standards for integrating traditional financial assets with blockchain [technology](https://finbold.com/category/technology-news/).

As the landscape for tokenized real-world assets continues to mature, the sector’s growth trajectory suggests a strong market shift towards assets that offer tangible yields. This shift is largely driven by the blockchain community’s preference for investments that merge traditional financial stability with the innovative potential of digital assets. 

With nearly $8 billion in TVL and rising user engagement, the future of RWA protocols looks promising as they bridge the gap between conventional asset markets and the digital [finance](https://finbold.com/category/finance-news/) realm.

The token for storage coin project Arweave (AR) has shed 18.7% overnight, taking some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide crash that has dragged market leader [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/)‘s (BTC) price down by 7%.

Arweave currently trades at a price of $27.76, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave). Given the fact it is currently posting 7-day losses of 18.1%, it’s clear the crash only began in the last 24 hours.

According to the token’s trading chart, a major sell-off occurred overnight. AR’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 27 with the potential to fall further. RSI is a metric analyzing whether a token is priced well or not based on current buying and selling momentum.

An RSI below 30 is oversold, so it looks like tempestuous waters for the rest of the day. For some, this may be a perfect dip-buying opportunity, but as with any investment, investors should research prudently.

Arweave’s AR is currently trading about $4 south of its 30-day moving average, represented by the blue line. This further underscores the token’s extreme volatility right now.

Although AR is not a blockchain-based token, the Arweave protocol taps a distributed ledger system (DLS) to store data across multiple nodes.

The primary function of Arweave is to be a decentralized data storage solution, matching users who need data storage with those who have a surplus of it to give away.

It’s competitor, [Filecoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/is-filecoin-going-to-zero-fil-price-dips-4-as-new-bitcoin-platform-hits-7-2-million.htm) (FIL), posted lighter overnight losses of around 6% and currently changes hand at $5.33. 

Cryptocurrencies everywhere are tumbling. Bitcoin’s heavy intraday losses put it now at around $57,500, far south of the $60k psychological support level and some 22% down from an all-time high of $73,737.94, posted on March 14 this year. 

Investors Stack Mega Dice While Funds Exit Arweave.
---------------------------------------------------


Projects like Arweave and Filecoin both underscore the premise that crypto has a lot more to offer the world beyond payments and a store of value.

Today’s market crash may have briefly dimmed their shine, but the world hasn’t seen the last of utility tokens. As developers get more comfortable with the technology, crypto will likely be utilized in ways we can’t imagine yet.

GambleFi is one sector that’s getting more of a look-in nowadays. That’s because it’s a crypto-native Web3 version of online gambling.

According to [data compiled by Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/online-gambling/worldwide), revenue in the sector market is projected to climb to $100.90 billion this year.

That means investors wanting a head start on Web3’s newest innovations early are more likely to find heady upside potential in tokens attached to crypto-integrated iGaming platforms, like Mega Dice.

**TL;DR**

*   The cryptocurrency market has recently suffered heavy losses, with major assets experiencing significant declines.
*   Despite the downturn, there is one meme coin that saw a dramatic increase, surging 800% in a week after being launched on PancakeSwap and receiving backing from Crypto.com.

[![Image 1](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CAW_CB.jpg)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CAW_CB.jpg)

The cryptocurrency sector recently [erased](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) much of the gains recorded in the last few months, with its global market capitalization plunging to as low as $2.2 billion. The leading digital assets – Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and many more – are deep in the red on a 7-day scale.

The bloodbath in the meme coin is even more severe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 22% weekly, while dogwifhat (WIF) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have lost nearly 30% of their valuations for the same period. 

However, one asset of that type stands well in the green amid the grim reality, and its name is Crow With Knife (CAW).

[![Image 2](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4092929)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=183000&amp;plid=2349124&amp;setID=631314&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=863584&amp;banID=521782170&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2268194&amp;adSize=300x250&amp;mt=1714574497076911&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2Fthis-meme-coin-defies-the-negative-market-trends-with-a-800-weekly-surge-details%2F&amp;hc=c121f3b568489fcc5f20435d2271ba27f3aedab4&amp;location=)

The meme coin saw the light of day in mid-March, but its price started rallying by the end of last month. It is up almost 50% on a 24-hour scale and a whopping 800% weekly. In addition, its market capitalization surpassed the $100 million mark.

CAW’s latest price explosion [coincides](https://twitter.com/crow_with_knife/status/1785418778186039558) with the asset’s launch on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. Previously, it [received](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-app-lists-crow-with-knife-caw) support from the popular cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com, which opened trading services with it.

Other meme coins that have turned into sensations in the past several months include [dogwifhat](https://cryptopotato.com/solana-meme-coin-wif-hits-ath-after-120-weekly-surge-possible-reasons/) [(WIF)](https://cryptopotato.com/solana-meme-coin-wif-hits-ath-after-120-weekly-surge-possible-reasons/), Bonk Inu (BONK), [BOOK OF MEME (BOME)](https://cryptopotato.com/book-of-meme-meme-enters-top-100-crypto-assets-days-after-launch-following-major-binance-news/), and more. Interestingly, they are all built on the Solana blockchain, whereas CAW is a token part of the Cronos ecosystem.

The rapid price movements in the meme coin sector as of late are yet another example of the cohort’s infamous volatility. If you are about to jump on the bandwagon, please check our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:

Ex-Coinbase designer raises $5M for governance startup Agora
------------------------------------------------------------

Agora, a cross-chain platform offering a new standard of governance tools for decentralized protocols, has raised $5 million in a seed funding round led by Haun Ventures. The round also saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, Seed Club Ventures, and Consensys Ventures, among others. Agora aims to help protocols organize their voting systems and tackle the often chaotic nature of token-holding voter governance.

Co-founder Yitong Zhang, a former designer at [Coinbase](https://cryptobriefing.com/coinbase-lightning-network-integration-lightspark/) said in an interview that current systems for governance voting were “chaotic.” With Agora, however, Zhang believes that users can “have all the benefits of having your equity directly on the internet without the chaos.”

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

Agora’s other co-founders, Charlie Feng and Kent Fenwick, bring experience from multibillion-dollar fintech Clearco, where Feng was a co-founder and Fenwick served as an engineering executive.

Agora has already attracted notable customers such as [Uniswap](https://cryptobriefing.com/uniswap-blast-network-yield/), [Optimism](https://cryptobriefing.com/optimism-token-funding-2024/), and Nouns. The startup plans to use the new funding to invest in its product and keep up with the increasing demand it has seen in the last quarter. The company is committed to building for the long term and open-sourcing its software under the MIT license to advance the ecosystem.

This approach has also led to contributions from various developers, governance tooling teams, and startups in the development of Agora’s API.

The company believes that token-backed voting and collective governance are the best ways to move the internet away from “walled gardens” and transition it from private enterprises to common protocols. While the Web2 era may have mastered private apps, Agora sees collective protocols as being in their infancy. Unlike static, traditional protocols like HTTP that require little to no management, crypto protocols are constantly evolving ecosystems that require consensus from a complex array of stakeholders.

According to Zhang, protocols may be perceived as “fundamentally less effective” than equity-governed apps (private companies) due to a lack of investment in tooling. Agora’s mission is to address this issue by making the development of MIT-licensed software for running protocols its top priority. The company acknowledges that the outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is challenging, but it believes the goal and timing are right.

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/peak-fud-dips-bitcoin

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin fell to $56,000 during Asian bear with the coin somewhat recovering to $58,000, but it has been showing weakness since the Israel-Iran tensions.

It has failed to keep any bounces so far as bears grab their temporary season to serve us plenty of FUD.

First, the founder of Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao is getting four months in prison for lax AML/KYC controls.

Some media is reporting it at money laundering, but banks do that sort of money laundering every day and get no more than a small fine.

While he gets prison, though hopefully a suspended sentence, and that's because regulators really did not like him not sticking to traditional structures with an HQ, and of course because of the SBF Tweet.

Then from left field we have Roger Ver, a bitcoin advocate, getting charged with tax evasion for failing to fully disclose his capital gains when he renounced his US citizenship.

Neither should really matter to the market which keeps waiting for the MT Gox coins to be distributed at potentially any moment, though no coins have moved.

To show how much bears are having fun however, huge combined inflows of $200 million in one day on Monday by the new Hong Kong ETFs were initially dismissed on social media as just $2 million volumes.

The US ETFs however continue red, with Fidelity's FBTC seeing its biggest outflow yet on Tuesday at $35 million. Same for Bitwise's BITB at $34 million while BlackRock saw its fifth day of zero inflows.

It might come as a surprise to some that ETF investors and traders are like any other investor, not least because they have market makers like Jane Street with its [vast operations](https://www.ft.com/content/54671865-4c7f-4692-a879-867ef68f0bde).

So Janet is going to sell or buy depending on whether she thinks the market thinks it will up or down, and sometime our Janet might even have funny ideas and try to move the market herself, though only on one minute candles.

That means the ETF flows are only useful to see sentiment, but not when direction turns because the live price would show that way before hand.

It does though mean the autumn anticipation of huge inflows has now played out, though only to some extent because the ETFs stopped buying only when their huge purchases were not quite moving the price up any more.

They are no where near being out of ammo, they're just not dumb. When the market turns, they'll allocate again.

In many ways this is good news because if we were at $100k right now for example, the fall might have been quicker and steeper as it would have risen too quick.

Cooling down instead and consolidating gives room for another leg up and makes the decisions both to invest and trade easier because we're in familiar territory.

Bad as this mini-bear may have been therefore, and liquidating for some, it's just part of the orchestra for a tune-y song.

In eth, their most promising dapp, EigenLayer, turned out to be a bear airdrop with their March 15 snapshot meaning most got little or nothing, while their decision to ban places like Canada indicated there's some politics behind it with the CEO so being Indian-American.

Our bear commission also took some center stage with ConsenSys suing SEC for secretly classifying eth as a security.

"New court filings indicate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of eth at a Financial Committee hearing to conduct oversight of his agency," Representative Patrick McHenry [said](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1785317163110130028).

And? What's Congress going to do about it? In UK you can be held in contempt of Parliament, which means actual prison. While for US we're finding out SEC is an "arbitrary and capricious" agency and nothing is being done about it at all.

We could maybe do something if we really wanted to, and maybe we should if he denies the Ethereum spot ETFs.

It's so difficult to see what a SEC lawyer would say in court, so such decision would be straight out political. Which means some in Silicon Valley maybe, if we really wanted to, can get Biden's ear and fire the chair.

Because there gotta be some rules somewhere. Ok, this stuff is part of the game and we've been playing it since Supernintendos, so fair enough. But this other stuff, like o I got the power and can do what I want even after being slapped by a court, well then maybe we can play it that way as well.

Not sure we're there, even if they deny the ETF. This ConsenSys lawsuit on the other hand is just putting up the lawyers' layer, our own army to fight the capo, and at this point really we'd like it very much if anything SEC related comes with 'our lawyers say.'

Not like the coward EigenLayer, which basically said: you can't imprison/fine me, I imprison myself. Though prison here is out of the question as this is civil law stuff, you get a cost of business fine at most.

We have to fight them basically, and as investors that means favoring projects which stand up to them, and not favoring those that cower at a cost of business.

Some parts of what SEC does are fair enough. It's a debate, through lawyers, courts, Congress, and we either win or get a compromise. The outcome is irrelevant from an investment perspective as long as we fight because this Eigen-censorship is the worst in giving them all they want, when we can strengthen the lawyers' layer and either get all that we want or some of it.

All of which means in the end, this is good news for eth. Its ratio is up because we're fighting and that means there's a chance of victory \[insert Churchill's voice\]. As for the security classification itself, for the ETF doesn't matter because ETFs are securities. For eth, some say it would be bad, but we don't think it matters since we're not kids anymore, we've got a lawyers' army that can deal with that stuff. At worst, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) might have to file some paperworks. What happens when its funding runs out? Well, when we get to the point of actually asking that question, the SEC paperworks will be the very least of our concerns. It shows it is not a security because EF can dissolve, while eth keeps on, but this SEC bit doesn't have much to do with the law because the law debate was closed in 2018 when we got [the eth compromise](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/06/14/ethereum-not-security-icoed-security-tokens-can-become-non-securities-says-sec).

So all the FUD then was just nonsense politics? Nothing in actual crypto? What we miss? Ah, yes more politics.

Today might be volatile because Fed's chair Jerome Powell will give the committee decision on how much your dollar unit of account should be worth according to the all knowing statisticians.

His decision will be no change, though the market will try and read whether he meant one rate cut, none, or maybe even rate hikes.

That explains yesterday's 2% red Nasdaq, with the market fixated on these rates again, or so it appears.

Just the dressing, to go with what it always does after touching ATH. It sits there and asks: are we really doing this?

A little drop, after a big rise, gives the playground to little bears, who this time have stupid and irrelevant politics as the biggest FUD.

Just narrative to massage what the price does after the fact, when the price is sitting there comfortably, saying to itself: well, obviously we're gone do this, we came this far. The question is when?

Or if, of course, it can also drop more, but lull summer is coming, when we can enjoy the beach.

Or so we hope because while the power brokers are out, it's a good time to coup governments, like in UK or Italy in 2022, or to sue Coinbase as SEC did last year.

Can't have Christmas traditions for summer peace, but volumes tend to be lower. So that can mean sidewaying, with maybe some drifting up this time.

The good news is that 'sidewaying' now includes $75k. So we'll see how long these little bears keep the microphone.

Markdown Content:
Over $500 million worth of cryptocurrency long positions were liquidated recently, signaling a reversal on the cryptocurrency [market](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-at-end-of-correction-top-analyst-suggests). This catastrophic drop, obviously caused by Bitcoin's drop below $60,000, has not only impacted major cryptocurrencies but could cause [troubles](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) for smaller tokens.

The Bitcoin chart demonstrates a severe drop below the critical support level of $60,000, cascading down to around $57,000. This massive sell-off triggered widespread panic selling and liquidations. Such extensive liquidations can exacerbate market declines, pushing prices further down as traders rush to close positions, either voluntarily or through forced liquidations.

Interestingly, while long liquidations dominated the structure of the market, the last few hours saw a noticeable increase in short liquidations. As traders awaited further drops and positioned themselves in shorts with some leverage, a slight squeeze occurred. This unexpected shift led to a minor rebound in prices, suggesting a short-term recovery might be possible. However, do not place too much hope in it as it could be purely speculative. 

For Bitcoin, the next support level to watch is around $55,000. If this level fails to hold, the next significant support lies near the $52,000 mark. Resistance, on the other hand, can be found at $60,000 and then at $63,000. A break above these levels could signal a potential recovery, but the source for such a move remains unclear.

The current [market](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) situation paints a grim picture for the long-term outlook. The high volume of liquidations indicates a lack of confidence among investors, which could discourage the inflow of new capital essential for sustaining higher price levels. 

For smaller assets like Shiba Inu, Cardano or even [XRP](https://u.today/ripple-cto-ends-speculation-on-xrp-holdings) sentiment and investor enthusiasm, the outlook is even darker. The loss of confidence from major cryptocurrency holders can ripple down to these smaller assets, potentially leading to significant declines.

[Changpeng Zhao](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-verdict-is-in-cz-to-do-4-months-in-jail/) (CZ), founder of [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), the leading digital currency exchange in the world, released his statement one month after the end of the criminal case against him and the conclusion of a sentencing hearing. 

The court imposed a term of four months of imprisonment on CZ, a lesser sentence than US authorities’ required 36 months punishment preference.

CZ\`s gratitude and acknowledgment
----------------------------------

CZ [overemphasized](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488) gratitude for the character-scrubbing of the proceedings, which he sincerely expressed by thanking everyone who supported him during the court sessions. 

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).

&gt; 
&gt; — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

He admitted the many forms of straightforward listening: letters and public displays. These avenues gave him what he needed for the many challenging periods. He outlined his plans to stay somewhat in the picture as an investor, and his company remains the owner of the crypto world. He signaled that compliance was the most important thing in the policy.

While concluding the broader issue arising from his legal cases, he asserted that, given the growing importance of compliance in the cryptocurrency era, the company has surely entered a new phase of history. 

Under the intense supervision of legal scrutiny, the former head of the exchange opened his eyes to the silver lining of the security measures under the light of supervision. The stakeholders’ reassuring comments about the security measures headed in this direction actually put the issues of funds at rest: SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users).

Lessons learned and prospects
-----------------------------

Despite the judicial chapter drawing to a close, there was a genuine willingness on the side of CZ to serve out his sentence, which marked the end of one phase of his life and rather transition into another. 

Notwithstanding that all is not exactly well with him, he maintains a measure of resilience, having retreated to an inconspicuous position in the cryptocurrency market. the statement embraces not a single attitude but a combination of gratitude, acknowledgment, and optimism. 

These feelings relate to personal growth and positive views of the cryptocurrency industry. With time, the development of the digital assets industry, as CZ business story reflects, demonstrates the need for compliance and security to be considered when creating and trading digital assets.

**May 2024 is poised to be a pivotal month for the crypto market, influenced by several critical events that could shape its trajectory.**

From key economic indicators to significant regulatory decisions, here’s an overview of what market watchers anticipate this month.

Macroeconomic Factors: Federal Reserve Meeting and April CPI Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, concluding on May 1, is among the most anticipated events. Despite ongoing concerns about persistent [inflation](https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/), the Fed will [likely maintain the borrowing rate steady](https://beincrypto.com/fed-rates-bitcoin-inflation-hedge/) between 5.25%-5.5%.

This decision could signal a continued conservative approach amidst economic uncertainties, impacting investor sentiment in the crypto sector.

On May 2, the US Treasury Department is slated to [announce](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2315) its refunding plans for the upcoming quarter, potentially offering some relief to markets. After three consecutive quarters of increasing auction sizes, the Treasury plans to steady most of its auction sizes.

Investors are particularly keen on the details of an anticipated debt repurchase program and its implications for long-term US financing strategies amid escalating debt concerns. Although there may be increases in specific issues like the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), most auctions are expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market liquidity and interest rates.

Another noteworthy development is the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on May 15. As shelter costs contributed to over half of the 3.5% CPI [inflation rate as of March 2024](https://beincrypto.com/events-march-crypto-market-volatility/), the financial market will keep a close eye on this report. Any significant change might influence the Fed’s monetary policy, impacting crypto market stability.

BeInCrypto reported in August 2022 that the Netherlands Crime Agency (FIOD) [arrested Pertsev in Amsterdam](https://beincrypto.com/dutch-cops-arrest-29-year-old-suspected-tornado-cash-developer/) following the sanctions from the US treasury upon Tornado Cash. FIOD alleged Persev for sponsoring illicit financial flows, money laundering, and mixing cryptocurrencies through a decentralized Ethereum mixing service, Tornado Cash.

Meanwhile, other Tornado Cash developers in the US, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, [faced several charges from the Department of Justice (DOJ)](https://beincrypto.com/doj-crypto-privacy-tornado-cash/). The charges include conspiring to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions imposed by OFAC.

The crypto community keenly awaits the outcome of Tornado Cash’s case, which fears it may establish a precedent that threatens developers of privacy-focused software within the ecosystem.

SEC Decisions: The Fate of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs
----------------------------------------------------

At the end of the month, the crypto community is also anticipating the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) responses to the [spot Ethereum ETF filings](https://beincrypto.com/sec-blackrock-spot-ethereum-etf-comments/). The spotlight is on VanEck’s and ARK’s applications, with deadlines for the SEC’s decision set for May 23 and May 24, respectively.

Despite the anticipation, skepticism runs high among industry experts regarding the SEC’s approval. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, [doubts the spot Ethereum ETF approval](https://beincrypto.com/vaneck-ceo-spot-ethereum-etf-rejection/).

&gt; “The way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs — and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,” van Eck explained earlier in April.

VanEck isn’t alone in its pessimism. Industry analysts like James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence echo the sentiment. Balchunas himself reduced his approval odds from 70% to less than 35%.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently sitting on the edge, with some of its most visible metrics pointing toward an imminent sell-off. Top market analyst Ali Martinez, however, has [projected](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1785602766280286684) a very intriguing trend for the meme coin. Per his recent exposition, SHIB might be gearing up for a bullish reversal.

As noted by Ali Martinez, Shiba Inu is exhibiting a bull flag trend on the daily chart. A bull flag formation is a continuation pattern that is formed amid two major price spikes separated by a brief consolidation period. 

Shiba Inu outpaced its bearish stalemate earlier this year when its price soared as high as $0.000036 in March. The Shiba Inu trend has, however, buckled under the weight of broader market uncertainty. With the spot Bitcoin ETF losing its inflow traction, the impact has been felt for altcoins, including Shiba Inu.

With the bull flag formation, Martinez hinted at a more hyped sentiment. He revealed plans to place a buy order on the token at $0.000018343, as he is "aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323."

Shiba Inu's ambitions stumped
-----------------------------

Shiba Inu is currently changing hands for $0.00002108, [down](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/) by 8.71% in 24 hours and by more than 22% in the past week. However, it has remained elevated in the year-to-date (YTD) period, soaring by 11%.

The current [bearish market trend](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) has contributed to shifting the project’s focus from the [top 10 in ranking](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-might-displace-cardano-as-top-10-if-this-happens) to mere survival. Amid the 500% spike in [Shiba Inu transaction fees](https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium), the outlook of SHIB has not changed, with investors choosing more safety bets overall.

With Shibarium serving as a major utility and demand anchor, Shiba Inu community members are not giving up hope on the possibility of imminent revival. Martinez’s charts are also a sentiment booster that can drive prices overall.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) held near two-month lows at the May 1 Wall Street open as risk assets braced themselves for the next United States macro move.

Bitcoin volatility cools into FOMC
----------------------------------

Data from [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://subscription.cointelegraph.com/) and [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCGBP/?exchange=BINANCE) followed skittish BTC price action hours after new lows of $56,500 on Bitstamp.

Traders remained on edge across risk assets ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next interest rates announcement and subsequent press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.

After the Quarterly Refunding Announcement, or QRA, [dealt a blow to the U.S. liquidity outlook](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-loses-60k-support-2-month-lows), market participants hoped that Powell’s tone after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting would not lean too hawkish.

“The FOMC statement and Powell presser this afternoon are likely to confirm USD money market pricing of a much more tepid policy normalization cycle,” Darius Dale, founder and CEO of risk management firm 42 Macro, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DariusDale42/status/1785617419169329344) in part of a digest on X (formerly Twitter).

&gt; “As much as Chair Powell would prefer to play up ‘two-sided risks to the economic outlook’, the reality is the preponderance of evidence supports the ‘no landing’ scenario as the highest probability outcome. As such, ‘higher for longer’ is likely to be the dominant message today.”

Fed target ra

The latest data from CME Group’s [FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) underscored the lackluster expectations for good news, with the odds of the Fed holding rates at their current levels at 99%.

Striking a more optimistic tone, popular trader CrypNuevo suggested that the worst Bitcoin and altcoin losses were likely complete.

“BTC really dropped hard and this reinforces the idea that whatever Jerome Powell has to say today, it's likely priced-in,” he [told](https://twitter.com/CrypNuevo/status/1785659617122349256/photo/1) X subscribers.

“Will we get a retest of the range lows?”

In the latest edition of its London &amp; New York Daily Color market updates sent to Telegram channel subscribers, meanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital referenced both Powell and the QRA as potentially holding surprises for risk-on sentiment.

“There are two important events happening today that could either exacerbate this bearish move or reverse it,” it stated.

&gt; “Firstly, if Powell is dovish at FOMC, it could provide a bullish flip. Secondly, if the QRA (Quarterly Refunding Announcement) sees heavy issuances in US bills (front-end) instead of the 10-year (back-end) it would reduce fears of longer-term rates spiking and might put some brakes on the USD rally.”

BTC price in "typical" bull market retrace
------------------------------------------

Bitcoin traders thus eyed important BTC price levels to watch after multiple lines in the sand fell through.

“This current Bitcoin retrace is slowly turning into an almost 50-day retrace,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital [revealed](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785662534487245112/photo/1) on the day.

An accompanying chart compared BTC price pullbacks throughout the bull market which began in early 2023.

Rekt Capital described the latest downside move, coming in at over 20%, as “typical” within this context.

“Typical retraces have been 2-3 weeks, longer ones up to 2 months,” he noted.

Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, meanwhile forecast a possible Bitcoin renaissance following in the footsteps of gold in recent years.

“I think we can go lower than on that chart, but if its bullish over the next months it might happen like this as a general idea,” he wrote in an [X thread](https://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1785645939149193222) while comparing the two assets.

URL Source: https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/01/as-cz-gets-his-sentence-michael-lewis-should-rewatch-star-wars/

Markdown Content:
Author Michael Lewis tends to take a very charitable stance regarding Sam Bankman-Fried despite his recent conviction, which led to a [25-year prison sentence](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sentencing/).

Following publication last year of "Going Infinite," Lewis' book about the FTX founder that many said is over-generous, a Time magazine journalist [asked him](https://time.com/6321668/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite/) about [criticisms](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/books/review/going-infinite-michael-lewis.html). "This is what happens when you address a mob," he said.

When movie rights for the book were shopped around Hollywood, the pitch letter said, as [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/14/big-short-author-michael-lewis-spent-months-with-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-and-is-writing-a-book/) in 2022, that Lewis "likens \[SBF and Binance's Changpeng "CZ" Zhao\] to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto" – and it wasn't hard to deduce that SBF was, in the "Big Short" author's view, the good guy and CZ the bad guy. SBF got a quarter century in prison. CZ was [just sentenced to four months](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-to-appear-in-court-today-for-sentencing/), and the judge, when explaining why he wasn't harsher on the former Binance CEO, said, "Everything I see about you and your characteristics are of a mitigating nature." Also: "There's no evidence that the defendant was ever informed" of illegal activity at Binance, the judge said.

Contrast that with what a judge told SBF when [deciding](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sentencing/) the length of his prison stay: "The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight." Also, SBF never offered "a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes."

Meanwhile, CZ stepped up, according to his judge: "The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility."

SBF was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. CZ pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Wrongdoing in both cases, but on completely different scales (though Binance did agree to pay a multi-billion-dollar fine.)

Lewis sold a lot of copies of his book, and a movie is [apparently being made](https://theankler.com/p/inside-hollywoods-sbf-mad-scramble-c04) via Apple. But he might want to watch "Star Wars" to remind himself who's who, if the U.S. legal system is any judge of character, anyway.

The world’s largest asset manager led a $47 million funding round by a blockchain-focused firm it has worked with before

The world’s largest asset manager appears poised to move deeper into the tokenization space after injecting capital into a tokenization firm it has worked with before.

BlackRock led a $47 million funding round for Securitize, a company focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, the firms said Wednesday. 

Fintech companies and [traditional finance giants have increasingly been testing out tokenization](https://blockworks.co/news/citibank-explores-tokenization-wisdomtree), noting that blockchain rails can help reduce costs and improve transparency. BlackRock Larry Fink has called tokenized securities “the next generation for markets.” 

To that end, [BlackRock](https://blockworks.co/tag/blackrock) and Securitize are not strangers. 

BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund — the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — in March, offering a different way to earn US dollar yields. Qualified investors can subscribe to that fund through Securitize Markets.

“We believe that [tokenization](https://blockworks.co/tag/tokenization) has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure,” Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships, said in a statement. “Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy.”  

Chalom is now a member of Securitize’s board of directors.

Other investors in the $47 million funding round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. 

Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane in January 2023 made [available](https://securitize.io/learn/press/hamilton-lane-fund-securitize-polygon) one of its equity funds through a Securitize feeder fund tokenized on Polygon.

Research

It's increasingly apparent that orderbooks represent the most efficient model for perpetual trading, with the primary obstacle being that the most popular blockchains are ill-suited for hosting a fully onchain orderbook. Hyperliquid is a perpetual trading protocol built on its own L1 that aims to replicate the user experience of centralized exchanges while offering a fully onchain orderbook.

URL Source: https://cryptopotato.com/this-analyst-says-you-should-sell-your-btc-in-may-and-go-away/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T14:22:54+00:00

Markdown Content:
Nic Puckrin, the co-founder and CEO of crypto information portal Coin Bureau, thinks selling one’s bitcoins (BTC) in May would be more profitable than offloading the assets in September.

According to his [tweet](https://x.com/nicrypto/status/1785607112682246286), the cumulative returns of disposing of one’s cryptocurrencies in May have surpassed selling in September or any other time of the year by over 1000%.

Puckrin explained that the phrase “Sell in May, Go Away” is from the traditional finance space and refers to the effect of seasonality. The adage dates back centuries and postulates that the best six months of the year for stocks are recorded from November through April, suggesting that investors should sell in May and wait until October to buy again.

The saying may apply to the crypto sector because in the past five years, buying BTC in October and selling in April has accrued cumulative returns of 1,449% compared to buying in May and selling in September, which had a negative return of -29%.

Puckrin [cited](https://x.com/nicrypto/status/1785607835872575683) a report by cryptocurrency research firm K33 to substantiate his claims, insisting that other studies have shown similar results for the same strategy. Hence, the Coin Bureau CEO believes crypto investors would have realized more profits if they sold their assets last month, especially after BTC rallied to $73,700 for the first time in mid-March and traded around $70,000 for the remainder of the month.

Market Sentiment is Cooling
---------------------------

On-chain indicators and macroeconomic conditions suggest it may be too late for investors to sell their assets now, seeing that May has gotten off to a bad start and market sentiment has started cooling.

The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index [shows](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-investor-sentiment-turns-neutral-as-btc-price-plummets-below-57k/) retail sentiment is waning as it is in neutral territory. Puckrin said Bitcoin search trends have declined, and X is full of doom posts.

Institutions also appear to be less bullish on crypto investment products, as seen in the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market witnessing steady outflows for the past five consecutive trading days. Even the newly-launched ETFs in Hong Kong are [seeing](https://cryptopotato.com/disappointing-launch-day-for-hong-kongs-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-as-btc-slumps-below-61k/) much lower inflows than analysts predicted.

In addition, Puckrin disclosed that perpetual funding rates have declined substantially, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures open interest held by non-ETF funds have fallen to their lowest since October 2023.

Meanwhile, BTC has [fallen](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) more than 22% from its all-time high and was [changing hands](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) at $57,100 at the time of writing.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/gold-vs-bitcoin-expert-predicts-may-prices-for-top-assets/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T14:20:07+00:00

Markdown Content:
Though some experts, analysts, and marketers have been rhetorically placing [gold](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-gold-with-a-credit-card/) and [Bitcoin](https://finbold.com/guide/fastest-way-to-buy-bitcoin/) ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) in the same category for years, they have seemingly diverged in significant ways in 2024. 

Indeed, while gold has been rising at an incredible pace as [economic and geopolitical concerns mount](https://finbold.com/how-putin-and-xi-are-secretly-fueling-golds-record-rally/), BTC’s [trading](https://finbold.com/guide/cryptocurrency-trading/) is more risk-off, with the most striking example coming at the height of the Israel-Iran war scare when fears seemingly outweighed the optimism stemming from the halving event.

Despite the world’s premier [cryptocurrency](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) seeing its highest month-end prices on record in March, _Bloomberg’s_ Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone [opined](https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1785619729685582216) in a recent [X](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-x-stock/) post that gold has a substantial upper hand compared to Bitcoin – and, indeed, compared to the [S&amp;P 500](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-spy-stock/).

### Picks for you

BTC in particular, stands in contrast with gold as, after hitting a new all-time high in March, it saw a massive decline in April which, by May, saw it drop to [approximatelly $57,000](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-plummets-under-57000-as-crypto-market-faces-bear-market-reality/) – a level some experts [identified](https://finbold.com/boom-or-bust-experts-reveal-bitcoin-price-that-will-determine-its-fate/) as a crucial [support](https://finbold.com/guide/support-and-resistance/) zone – while the world’s top [commodity](https://finbold.com/guide/what-are-commodities/) ended the fourth month at its own record price.

Gains for gold and pain for Bitcoin
-----------------------------------

McGlone’s most recent analysis follows his previous assessments closely as he sees substantial volatility and arguably the anomalous performance of [stocks](https://finbold.com/stocks/) in a high [interest rate](https://finbold.com/guide/best-interest-rate-savings-accounts/) environment as some of the crucial headwinds for BTC and S&amp;P 500 and important tailwinds for gold and other commodities.

Additionally, stocks and cryptocurrencies may face trouble ahead in similar ways to commodities when they had to swallow a price cure resulting from a COVID-era price surge back in 2022 before reentering the more recent rally.

“A primary headwind for the S&amp;P 500 may be the high-price cure example that’s afflicted most commodities since 2022. It’s likely not a coincidence that #inflation has remained sticky and FederalReserve rate-cut risks have leaned toward hikes, on the back of the rapidly rising stock index closing at the 5,254 high in 1Q.”

The expert also assessed that the increasingly hawkish rhetoric coming out of the FED is likely only to further emphasize the dynamic, which leans well into his previous forecast that gold is set to [surge toward $3,000](https://finbold.com/opportunity-gold-could-reach-3000-per-ounce/) per ounce this year.

Finally, McGlone also linked the likely upcoming fortunes of the wider [cryptocurrency market](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) to the apparent slowdown that is affecting the [stock market](https://finbold.com/category/stocks-news/) and its major [indices](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-trade-indices/) and explained it might struggle to maintain momentum should the S&amp;P 500 truly end its “almost straight up rally’ – a scenario he judged likely with [recent recessionary forecasts](https://finbold.com/us-recession-is-delayed-but-still-coming-warns-chief-strategist/) – that started after they hit October 2023 lows.

Still, it is noteworthy that the macro strategist’s forecasts – when it comes to cryptocurrencies at least – haven’t historically been the most accurate given that he [forecast trouble ahead](https://finbold.com/crypto-recession-alert-mike-mcglone-signals-troubles-ahead/) for the crypto markets less than a month before they entered into a major rally.

[Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world), took the world by storm in 2019 — and then eroded to near rubble as the entire crypto market contracted and the industry fell into a nearly two-year-long bear market. An objective assessment of the NFT phenomena might conclude that the technology did deliver on a good deal of its promises, and instead of writing off the failed projects as scams, it might be more insightful to take a closer look at what features were needed to make projects successful. 

On Episode 35 of _The Agenda_ podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Miles, a Web3 developer who is the creative mind behind FanSociety — a funding mechanism for musicians that borrows and blends ideas from traditional fan clubs of the 1950s with modern crowdfunding ideas and immutable storage on blockchain networks.

Tech should be adaptable and give users room to grow
----------------------------------------------------

Any aspiring musician knows that securing funding for an album is difficult, and of course, once the album is out, locking in fans for life becomes the next hurdle. Miles explained that he envisions FanSociety being used as a tool for [creators to connect with their audience](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/singer-verites-web3-music-nfts-community/), reward loyalty and grow in a way that is more organic than the typical NFT collections that currently exist.

He also explained that FanSociety has the dual purpose of allowing musicians to [raise money from fans](https://cointelegraph.com/news/music-nfts-are-helping-independent-creators-monetize-and-build-a-fanbase) while also rewarding and retaining them by giving them digital artifacts as part of their expanding discography.

According to Miles, a recurring issue with NFT collections is that projects often have fixed sizes and creators need to issue a new contract to “extend” the collection:

&gt; “It doesn’t make sense to have a limit, you know, and kind of just have one smart contract. And, like I said, it’s like a boolean. You either have the token, you either have the NFT or you don’t. And a lot of what was going on as well was very successful musicians were launching NFT projects, and it was kind of that same situation where, you know, they’ve only got 10,000 NFTs available, and you either have one or you don’t. And to me, that’s very elitist and kind of antithetical to kind of the whole Web3 ethos, to me. And so I wanted to do something different.”

Fan engagement should also have value
-------------------------------------

Revenue sharing is another issue FanSociety aims to tackle. Miles lamented that popular streaming platforms and record labels only give creators a sliver of the revenue generated by their music and that platforms tend to absorb the bulk of tips that creators receive from fans:

&gt; “You look at Twitch, for example. You tip somebody, you give them money, you subscribe to them. First of all, the platform takes 50% rev\[enue\] split, which is atrocious to me. And we don’t know if that’s going to go up in the future, right? The content creators on there don’t know if that’s going to go up to 60%, 70%, if they’re going to throw more fees on top of that. So there’s that kind of problem.” For artists who will use the platform to expand their catalog and engage with fans, Miles said the NFTs can be a [more meaningful show of appreciation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/music-nfts-a-powerful-tool-to-transform-an-audience-into-a-community) than “a sticker pack to put in their chat” or something else that is kind of gimmicky and “not very valuable.”

Miles said:

&gt; “I’d like to see more value being able to be given back to the supporters, and so that’s what I’m trying to support. And it’s up to the artist to decide what sorts of things, what sorts of ways they want to show their appreciation to people who support them.”

Witness Chain is the third-largest AVS on EigenLayer with 1.82 million staked Ether delegated.

Witness Chain, a proof system for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) networks, has attracted more than $5 billion worth of delegated stake from EigenLayer restakers.

Witness Chain [announced](https://twitter.com/witnesschain/status/1784958502630510636) the milestone via tweet on April 29. With the project now secured by 1.82 million ETH worth $5.24 billion, Witness Chain ranks as the [third largest](https://www.stakingrewards.com/assets/actively-validated-service?sort=restaking_marketcap&amp;timeframe=7d&amp;order=desc&amp;byChange=false) Actively Validated Service (AVS) on EigenLayer behind Eigen DA with $7.79 billion and Eoracle with $5.36 billion, according to Staking Rewards.

“Thanks to our wonderful community, we've surpassed $5B+ in restaked ETH,“ Witness Chain [tweeted](https://twitter.com/witnesschain/status/1784958502630510636). “Big hug to all 16,677 stakers, 53 operators, and LRTs for embarking on this journey to unify DePIN economies.”

Witness Chain is one of nine AVSs that are currently live on EigenLayer. EigenLayer, the pioneering Ethereum restaking protocol, allows Ethereum stakers to secure third-party [AVSs](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-launches-six-actively-validated-services) to earn additional yield on top of staking rewards.

DePIN Ecosystem
---------------

According to Ankr, a blockchain infrastructure provider and Witness Chain node operator, Witness Chain serves to unify the siloed [DePIN economy](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/depin-sector-sees-resurgence-in-2024).

“Through Witness Chain, a shared economy of integrated physical assets is unlocked, facilitating the exchange of resources like computing power, communication, energy, \[and\] storage,” Ankr [said](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-and-witness-chain-team-up-for-de-pin-and-avs-innovation/). “Witness Chain enables DePIN projects to share info about their physical locations, network capabilities, and more. This will allow dePINs to connect with each other, establishing an end-to-end supply chain of decentralized infrastructure.”

Witness Chain provides “Watchtower” nodes that function as independent auditors for DePIN networks.

The project offers several key services including Proof of Diligence — which verifies that Layer 2 transactions are executed correctly, Proof of Location — which verifies the physical location of DePIN infrastructure, Proof of Bandwidth — which verifies the network bandwidth available to DePIN projects, and a DePIN “Coordination Layer.”

Ankr said Witness Chain’s architecture enables the development of new applications on top of the shared DePIN ecosystem.

“By enabling DePIN projects to share information like location and capacity, watchtowers help create an interconnected ecosystem,” Ankr said. “Once two physically separated pieces of infrastructure recognize each other’s locations and can ensure enough connectivity, they can communicate with each other to exchange value, drive demand, enhance reliability, and reduce redundancy.”

Polygon’s DePIN push
--------------------

Witness Chain was built using Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK) and is among a growing list of Polygon-based DePIN projects enjoying significant growth.

On April 25, Dimo, a Polygon-based DePIN project allowing vehicle owners to collect and monetize data from their vehicles, [celebrated](https://twitter.com/DIMO_Network/status/1783495083511153052) that it had onboarded 80,000 vehicles within its network.

On April 30 and May 1, PowerPod, a Polygon-based DePIN network connecting electric vehicles, charging stations, and energy storage, [attended](https://twitter.com/PowerPod_People/status/1784873223982551210) the Mobility Live ME event in Abu Dhabi.

![Image 1: What's next for Binance founder CZ after his 4-month sentence?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _CZ is ready to do his time and move on to the next phase of life._
*    _Market watchers view Binance founder’s sentence as a “great deal.”_

[Binance \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as “CZ,” commented on his four-month [sentence](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-billionaire-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/) by the Seattle court on the 30th of April. 

Reacting to the sentence on X (formerly Twitter), CZ extended gratitude for the overwhelming support received during the trial and [said](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488), 

&gt; “I will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).”

Last November, CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money laundering regulations. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, paid $4.3 billion as part of the plea deal. 

Additionally, CZ paid $50 million in fines in the plea deal. However, market watchers viewed the fine as pale compared to his net worth of over $40 billion. 

#### Market reaction, what’s next for Binance founder?

Some claimed that the four-month sentence is a great deal considering prosecutors proposed a three-year sentence. 

Compared to the 25-year sentence given to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, CZ’s look like a tiny blip. 

One of the market watchers, Autism Capital, [claimed](https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1785407636940452339), 

&gt; “CZ really is the best to ever do it. Unlike Sam, he didn’t lose anyone’s money. He is still a hero to all. He literally memed his  prison sentence into existence. He does 4 months in the easiest camp prison playing pickleball and meditating. Walks away with $47 billion dollars”

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also acknowledged that CZ got a great deal and [quipped](https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1785395300229607541), 

&gt; “4 months for $40B in gains? $10B per month doesn’t sound too bad. I’d take that trade.  
&gt; I’d take that trade, too.”

The four-month sentence means CZ will be out by Q4 2024. In March, CZ revealed his new education project, Giggle Academy. 

The project aims to grant free education access to children and will be his main focus when he finishes the sentence. 

However, the former Binance chief reiterated that he will continue being a passive investor in crypto. 

&gt; “I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important. A silver lining of this whole process is that Binance has been under the microscope. And funds are SAFU.”

In the meantime, the BNB token was down 9% in the past 24 hours. But its price remained above $500, which has been a key psychological support since March.

In the face of a general market decline and pessimism, Captain Faibik, a cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast, has emerged with an optimistic outlook for [Bitcoin](https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-profit-crunch-hash-price-hits-record-low-post-halving-whats-next-for-miners/) (BTC) foreseeable future trajectory, predicting that the crypto asset could rise to a new all-time high before this current month closes. 

Bitcoin To Reach New All-Time High In May
-----------------------------------------

Faibik’s [analysis](https://x.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1785515818853265455), which is based on his in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency dynamics and a sharp eye for market trends, explores the possibility of a large short-term rise in Bitcoin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is at a key junction currently testing the daily Moving Average 100 (MA100) level once more after recovering from it in the past.

Historically, the crypto asset has found considerable support at the 100MA level. Should [BTC](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/spot-bitcoin-etfs-outflows/) recover from this point on, Captain Faibik anticipates a significant rise on the upside in the upcoming days. Thus, he expects the digital asset to reach a new all-time high within the month.

[![Image 4: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374568&amp;setID=366606&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293217&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714577892582984&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-milestone-ahead-analyst-forecasts-new-peak-this-month%2F&amp;hc=9136ba614e20c27d9b1d97ce2f9ffb7b79889b7e&amp;location=)

The post read:

&gt; Last time, BTC bounced back from the daily MA100, and now it is testing it again. If it bounces back from here, we can expect a Bullish Rally in the coming days. New All the High could be incoming this month

The crypto analyst noted Bitcoin’s price action in the daily timeframe also suggests that a bullish rise is on the horizon. Faibik stated that on the daily timeframe chart, BTC is still moving above the major trendline and inside the green box indicated in his chart. As a result, the analyst expects BTC to undergo a quick comeback.

Another notable finding from Captain Faibik is that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been drifting below a trendline that has been in place for some months. Although this might indicate a brief waning of positive momentum, Faibik interprets it as a sign of an impending price recovery for Bitcoin. Given that BTC is still moving inside the bullish flag pattern, the expert anticipates a [bounce back](https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-bounces-back-64500/) towards $68,000 in the upcoming days.

$100,000 Price Target For BTC
-----------------------------

Captain Faibik’s most bullish target for BTC recently is the $100,000 price mark. Last week, Faibik [pointed out](https://x.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1782607799559627136) key narratives that could catalyze Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 in the coming months.

Furthermore, Faibik highlighted that BTC Bulls have solidly secured the weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10 following the October 2017 Descending Channel breakout. Due to this, the crypto analyst is setting $100,000 as the digital asset’s next price target.

[![Image 6: a gold and black poker chip with the words huge get bonus](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4118444)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2374570&amp;setID=452519&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=873125&amp;banID=521839794&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2293220&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714577892762904&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin%2Fbitcoin-milestone-ahead-analyst-forecasts-new-peak-this-month%2F&amp;hc=aeb79834cca6754de434ad14ef857229fba900c9&amp;location=)

Following a decrease of more than 13% over the previous 7 days, the price of Bitcoin is currently trading at $57,701. In the last day, its market cap has plummeted by over 6%, while its trading volume has increased by about 61%.

*   **Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, expressed doubt about crypto trading during the market crash.**
*   **Markus’s remarks highlighted the crypto market’s decline.**
*   **Market experts have attributed several factors to this downturn.**

Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, has commented on the current downtrend witnessed by the crypto market. Markus is a crypto influencer with a large following of 2.1 million on X. He uses the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto and often shares memes and views on various topics, including politics, finance, and cryptocurrency. 

Following the dip of digital assets due to the current crypto market crash, the co-creator expressed doubt over crypto trading, [saying](https://x.com/BillyM2k/status/1785316776735383950), _“Man, crypto sure does suck.”_ 

Markus’s remarks highlighted the crypto market’s decline, led by the plummeting prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over the past intraday session, Bitcoin slipped by 5.69%, trading at $57,762 during press time. 

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, lost 3.87% of its value during the same period, reaching $2,894. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, created as a light-hearted parody of Bitcoin, dipped 8%, slipping from $0.1458 to $0.1252. 

Market experts have attributed several factors to this downturn, including Binance founder CZ’s four-month prison sentence for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and money laundering charges. 

In addition, disappointing job reports and the underwhelming performance of Bitcoin-Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong are said to have fueled this current market outlook, as investors expected it to surpass the performance of U.S. ETFs.

Hong Kong-based ETFs have demonstrated a healthy trend, amassing $12.4 million through trading activities. Meanwhile, these funds have seen substantial inflows, totaling $141 million, directed towards Bitcoin and partially into Ethereum.

In comparison, the figure observed upon the launch of U.S. spot ETFs totaled $740 million in assets, with trading volume reaching $4.6 billion. This stark contrast reflects the robust uptake and enthusiasm surrounding U.S. ETF offerings compared to their Hong Kong counterparts.

Moreover, Markus’s tweet mirrors a broader sentiment within the community, where concerns about market volatility and regulatory scrutiny persist. As such, investors remain vigilant for possible changes in market trajectory amidst ongoing developments.

The recent arrest of [Roger Ver,](https://u.today/breaking-bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-arrested) an early Bitcoin investor, has shaken the cryptocurrency community. The U.S. Department of Justice accused Ver of mail fraud, tax evasion and filing fake returns to avoid paying at least $48 million in taxes.

Ver, who earned the moniker "Bitcoin Jesus" after spreading the word about Bitcoin in its early days, was arrested in Spain this weekend and might be extradited.

The allegations are the latest brought by U.S. authorities against prominent crypto entrepreneurs. Changpeng Zhao, cofounder of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was sentenced to four months in jail on Tuesday. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange, received 25 years in prison.

The news of Ver's arrest has sent waves through the crypto community, provoking reactions from many, including Galaxy CEO and billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.

[Novogratz](https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1785639426875375978) called Roger Ver's arrest a "sad one." U.S. authorities accuse Ver of failing to record capital gains and pay taxes on his Bitcoin holdings, which he began acquiring in 2011.

&gt; The Roger Ver story is a sad one. He didn’t/ doesn’t trust the US govt. Of course, if you served hard time for selling firecrackers over the internet you might not either. He renounced his citizenship soon after serving his time. He hired lawyers and filed the paperwork.…

Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, although he was still obligated to file U.S. tax returns that included earnings from certain assets, such as Bitcoin. 

[Novogratz](https://u.today/mike-novogratzs-galaxy-digital-6000-eth-purchase-signals-institutional-interest) highlights the possibilities in the case, stating that "the feds" often go after cases with more than a 95% chance of winning.  

Expressing hopes that a settlement is reached quickly, Novogratz acknowledges Ver as a pioneer in the space, funding projects that helped create the crypto industry. He further added that while he disagreed with the Bitcoin evangelist's preoccupation with Bitcoin Cash, he always found him to be nice and helpful.   

"Hoping Roger reaches a settlement quickly and moves on with this. He was a pioneer in the space and funded lots of projects that helped create our industry. I really didn’t agree with him on his Bitcoin Cash obsession but always found him kind and helpful," Novogratz wrote.

Founder of MicroStrategy, Bitcoin holding giant, and its chairman, [Michael Saylor,](https://u.today/key-bitcoin-definition-issued-by-michael-saylor-as-btc-stages-decline) continues to endorse the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency in his tweets. This time, in his tweet, he emphasized Bitcoin’s strong qualities as a store of value, comparing it to other assets.

Saylor took to his X/Twitter account to say “Bitcoin is for the money you can't afford to lose.”

On the animated chart that came with the tweet, Saylor showed that since the halving that took place in 2016 (the second halving event in Bitcoin’s history) the percentage of original Bitcoin value relative to Bitcoin has been 100%. Therefore, it has been perfect as a store of value, Michael Saylor hinted, compared to its rivals – gold, the S&amp;P 500, U.S. real estate, the U.S. dollar and three other fiat currencies (albeit used in countries with troublesome economies), the Nigerian naira, the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso.

MicroStrategy adds more Bitcoin in April
----------------------------------------

MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, announced that during the month of April, it had acquired an additional [BTC lump of 122 coins](https://u.today/heres-how-much-michael-saylors-microstrategy-now-owns-in-bitcoin). That cost the business intelligence giant approximately $7.8 million as it bought those Bitcoins at the price of $63,934.

The company’s Bitcoin stash currently constitutes 214,400 BTC evaluated at a staggering $5.68 billion.

Over the past month, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has seen a massive price reduction as it dropped from above the $72,450 level to the current $58,150 price tag.

Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin lost roughly 10% after Binance's CZ was sentenced to four months in prison, “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver was arrested for tax evasion in Spain, Hong Kong Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs failed to meet traders’ expectations on the first trading day and a few other important factors.

[Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to "decentralize your own security," after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.

To prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig [Safe wallet](https://safe.global/).

"M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust," he wrote. "Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other."

The "[m-of-n](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/05/28/what-is-m-of-n-in-public-private-key-signing/)" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.

The conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym [0xkofi](https://twitter.com/0xKofi/status/1785294613579730966) on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage.

&gt; The above is why I use a multisig ([@safe](https://twitter.com/safe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) for &gt;90% of my personal funds 🙂
&gt; 
&gt; M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralize your own security.

"Your hardware wallet will be your fortress of solitude," Kofi wrote. "It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night. It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win."

But not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets.

[Vitalik Buterin Pushes for ‘Privacy Pools’ to Balance Anonymity With Regulatory Compliance](https://decrypt.co/155278/vitalik-buterin-pushes-for-privacy-pools-to-balance-anonymity-with-regulatory-compliance)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has co-authored a new research paper exploring how a privacy-preserving blockchain protocol could balance the need for user anonymity with regulatory compliance. The paper, co-authored by Buterin along with early Tornado Cash contributor Ameen Soleimani, Jacob Illum from the blockchain security firm Chainalysis, and two researchers from the University of Basel, delves into the subject of establishing a neutral infrastructure to incorporate privacy into blockch...

"When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself," he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.

That's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.

Although Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin.

"Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and [P](https://decrypt.co/144816/nft-artwork-owned-three-arrows-capital-sells-6-2-million-sothebys)unk6529," wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danftz) on Twitter.

How Coinbase, Grayscale, Robinhood And Binance Stack Up

One of the most interesting aspects of [blockchain](https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-blockchain/) is that everything is public. All transactions, wallets and portfolios are entirely accessible to anyone, allowing for an unprecedented amount of insight into a financial asset class. 

The uses of the data can range from monitoring overall trading activity and flows to seeing what the largest wallets and firms are doing with their positions. Arkham Intelligence is a blockchain analytics platform particularly interested in the second application. It cross-references financial disclosures by firms and individuals with on-chain activity to match up entities with specific wallet addresses. 

**Don't Miss:**

*   **Dogecoin millionaires are increasing — [**investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/dogecoin-millionaires-adv)**
*   **According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, [**here’s why it can be true**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/adv-6eth).**

With Arkham's insights, anyone can see how the largest entities in crypto are trading. One interesting application is looking at the largest firms in the space.

Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the world, operates a centralized exchange, wallet service and a layer-2 called Base. [Coinbase's portfolio](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/coinbase) is worth nearly $80 billion. The wallet is composed almost entirely of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The firm holds over 900,000 BTC, currently worth over $55 billion. It also holds over 6.6 million ETH worth roughly $20 billion. 

While Coinbase operates as a crypto custodian, Grayscale is a crypto asset manager. It creates a handful of funds and ETFs that allow investors to access crypto products. In January, it was one of the first companies to offer a [spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-spot-bitcoin-etfs) converted from a previously released futures ETF. Grayscale's portfolio has more than 99% of its value in ETH and BTC. It owns 303,050 BTC worth $18.6 billion and 2.98 million ETH worth $9 billion. Grayscale holds $27.6 billion in crypto assets. 

**Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, [**how much would $10 get you today**](https://www.benzinga.com/money/kraken)?**

While it is mostly known for its equity platform, Robinhood began offering crypto several years ago. The crypto platform offers a handful of the most popular tokens, but the portfolio is mostly invested in ETH, BTC and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The wallet has 140,000 BTC worth $8.6 billion, 1.5 million ETH worth $4.7 billion and 42.5 trillion SHIB worth $1 billion. 

As the largest crypto exchange in the world, it is no surprise that Binance (BNB) has the largest portfolio, worth over $200 billion. It holds 165 million BNB worth $94 billion, 640,000 BTC worth $40 billion, $27.2 billion worth of Tether (USDT) and 4.4 million ETH worth $13.2 billion. 

Coinbase has the largest ETH holding on the list. Its $20 billion of ETH is more than 5% of the total supply. The four firms hold a combined 15.5 million ETH, which is roughly 12.7% of the supply. 

While this may make it seem like the supply of ETH is heavily concentrated among a few entities, Coinbase, Robinhood and Binance hold assets for their customers. The portion of the supply held by these firms is under the discretion of the millions of people who hold ETH on these brokerages.

Update (May. 1 at 15h00 UTC): This article has been updated to include additional information about Figment's partnership with Bitvavo.

Netherlands cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo will tap into staking platform Figment’s institutional-grade infrastructure to stake a variety of tokens on behalf of its users.

Figment, which attracted significant investments from the likes of [Galaxy Digital in 2021](https://cointelegraph.com/news/galaxy-digital-backs-50m-funding-round-for-crypto-staking-outfit-figment), [announced](https://figment.io/insights/bitvavos-digital-asset-staking-now-powered-by-figment/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_term=5-1&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=content) that it would provide staking infrastructure for the Dutch exchange. Bitvavo will stake user assets across multiple proof-of-stake protocols including Ethereum, Solana and NEAR.

A statement from Bitvavo CEO and co-founder Mark Nuvelstijn highlighted the exchange’s efforts to review and enhance its product and services. The company also confirmed that Figment is an expansion and diversification of its pool staking service providers that includes Coinbase, Copper and Kiln.

Nuvelstijn added that staking has become an integral part of the cryptocurrency industry and that the provision is an essential service for its customer base of more than 1.5 million users across the Benelux region.

The Bitvavo CEO said that working with Figment would allow the exchange to provide additional security and safety around staking and expand the offering:

&gt; “Figment is one of the staking infrastructure leaders in the market, and we continue to be impressed by their staking- and up-to-date market knowledge.”

Figment EMEA head Eva Lawrence said the two teams have been working together for six months with the view of spearheading the exchange’s staking services across Europe.

The partnership is set to provide access to staking rewards on Bitvavo on newly launched networks. Figment is also establishing dedicated validator nodes for Bitvavo to provide high-quality network performance and security.

The Dutch exchange has continued a steady approach to expanding its footprint into Europe. [In Nov. 2023](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dutch-exchange-bitvavo-cleared-to-operate-in-france), it announced the launch of services to French users after successfully registering as a digital asset service provider with France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF).

The expansion into France followed Bitvavo's regulatory approval to offer its services in Austria. The exchange expanded its offering to Italy in 2022 and has filed registration applications for other major European markets.

Nuvelstijn previously [spoke exclusively](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-concerns-over-bitcoin-halving-supply-shock-says-bitvavo-ceo) to Cointelegraph during the European Blockchain Convention held in Barcelona in Oct. 2023, highlighting his belief that Europe's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework will allow cryptocurrency companies to offer financials services and vice versa

[Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38518143/hong-kongs-bitcoin-etf-debut-records-0-2-of-first-day-us-etf-trading-volume) (ETFs) experienced a substantial outflow of funds, totaling $162 million on Tuesday, according to financial analytics firm SoSoValue.

**What Happened**: The **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust** GBTC alone saw a [withdrawal](https://sosovalue.xyz/assets/etf) of $93.2277 million, contributing significantly to its historical net outflow of $17.303 billion. **Fidelity’s** FBTC FBTC bled $35.28 million, while **Bitwise’s** BITB BITB saw an outflow of $34.31 million. **Ark’s ETF ARKB** ARKB was the only ETF recording a net inflow, albeit a modest $3.6 million.

Following these developments, the total net asset value of **Bitcoin** BTC/USD spot ETFs fell below the $50 billion mark, landing at $49.413 billion.

**Why It Matters**: This trend of outflows contrasts sharply with the optimism surrounding the launch of new cryptocurrency spot ETFs in Hong Kong.

Harvest Global Investments and other firms received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which started trading on April 30, [according](https://wublock.substack.com/p/hong-kong-cryptocurrency-etf-first?r=jbpop&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true) to Wu Blockchain.

Notably, the initial offering of these ETFs saw significant interest from regions including Singapore and the Middle East, though Chinese mainland investors remain excluded from participating due to regulatory restrictions.

ChinaAMC led the launch with its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, boasting an initial offering size that surpassed $125 million—optimistically compared to U.S. launches by industry insiders.

However, the actual first-day trading volume in Hong Kong reached only $12 million, dwarfed by the $4.6 billion volume observed in the U.S. market on similar opening days.

This discrepancy underscores the varying investor appetite and market dynamics between the regions.

Despite the tepid trading volume, Hong Kong’s market showed signs of growth, with the listing of these ETFs heralded as a significant development in the region's financial landscape.

The SFC has outlined a comprehensive regulatory framework for these products, emphasizing the potential risks associated with high volatility and speculation in cryptocurrencies.

**What’s Next**: Looking ahead, the [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event, scheduled by Benzinga on Nov. 19, is set to delve deeper into these developments.

### How much is Bitcoin (BTC) worth?

Today, the price of Bitcoin stands at $63,930, with a trading volume over the past 24 hours reaching $24 billion. Its market capitalization is $1.3 trillion, and it currently commands 54% of the market share. Over the last 24 hours, the BTC price has experienced a 1.5% increase. As for its circulating supply, 19.46 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum possible supply of 21 million BTC.

Bitcoin price analysis: BTC price declined heavily as it dropped toward $62K
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL; DR Breakdown**

*   BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a bearish pattern as the price dropped below $63K
*   Resistance for BTC is present at $65,260
*   Support for BTC/USD is present at $62,464

The BTC price analysis for 28 April confirms that bears sparked a solid selling pressure as BTC price plunged buying confidence by heading below the $63K mark. However, BTC price is facing a minor upward correction now.

### BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense bearish pressure

Analyzing the daily price chart of Bitcoin, BTC’s price faced a robust selling pressure as the price continued to decline below immediate Fib channels and headed toward the $62K level. However, the price is facing a surge in buying demand from the recent low. The 24-hour volume has surged to $252 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. BTC price is currently trading at $63,930, increasing by over 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently trades below the midline at level 45, hinting that a bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.   

### BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction above moving averages

The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position as they are aiming to send the price below the Fib lines. However, bulls are maintaining buying confidence and are aiming to hold the price above the EMA20 trend line.

![Image 2: a chart showing the price of btc](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BTCUSD_2024-04-28_11-37-00-1200x524.jpg)

The BoP indicator is trading in a negative region at 0.19, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.

Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed bearish candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

### What to expect from BTC price analysis next?

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing for further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If BTC’s price successfully holds its momentum above $65,260, it will fuel a bullish rally to $67,186.

![Image 3: btc - btc - btc - btc - btc -](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BTCUSD_2024-04-28_11-27-27-1-1200x524.png)

If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $62,464, which may begin a bearish trend to $59,942.

Bitcoin has historically presented the opportunity for significant returns due to its decentralized nature. Bitcoin also holds the potential to act as an asset that does not correlate with the broader market trends, akin to gold. This characteristic suggests that it could move independently of other assets such as stocks. Additionally, the recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it a good investment option with bright market potential.

Recent BTC News/Opinions
------------------------

**Blackrock’s IBIT**: Blackrock has a Bitcoin fund called the Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This fund, which deals with Bitcoin directly, has increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than 252,011 BTC. This means the fund’s Bitcoin is worth about $18 billion now. There’s a big increase in interest from small investors, more than what Blackrock’s boss thought would happen.

**Morgan Stanley In Bitcoin ETF**: Morgan Stanley is planning to add Bitcoin funds to its brokerage platform. This comes after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF in January.

**SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETF:** The U.S. has approved spot Bitcoin ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced this decision on 11 January.

BTC Price Overview
------------------

The price of Bitcoin had experienced notable peaks and troughs in its value. Despite this volatility, the unique nature of the Bitcoin network and its limited supply of coins has attracted the attention of investors and traders worldwide. The [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/) technology underlying Bitcoin enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems.

In recent years, Bitcoin has trended upwards, with significant increases in value occurring in 2017 and 2021. This growth has been driven by a variety of factors, including increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as speculation by investors and traders. Today, Bitcoin is trading at +56654654.6% above its all-time low in July 2010.

While the future of Bitcoin’s price remains uncertain, many experts predict that the trend towards increased adoption and acceptance of digital currencies will continue to drive demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

BTC Price history
-----------------

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price again reached an all-time high in 2021, as values exceeded over 65,000 USD in November 2021. That particular price hike was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, whilst others in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively.

Tesla’s announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of the digital coin fueled mass interest.  The market was noticeably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly $17194.91 as of January 10, 2023, after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy.

Large BTC holders – ‘whales’ – are said to make up two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, and own approx 92 percent of BTC. As most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients rather than institutional investors, Bitcoin prices are difficult to measure, as movements from one large whale already have a significant impact on this market.

More on Bitcoin
---------------

### What is Bitcoin?

Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto created the coin to overcome the shortcomings of government-issued currencies without requiring a controlling authority.

Bitcoin (BTC) was created out of the need for a cryptography-based e-payment system rather than the conventional trust-based system. Cryptocurrency acts as a store of value and a payment method for any transaction process in the crypto space. It is often dubbed “digital gold.”

Bitcoin’s current cryptography is based on an impenetrable algorithm (SHA-256) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, after the collapse of the SHA-1 algorithm. This algorithm makes it impossible to crack the Bitcoin network.

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, its value has risen dramatically, from less than 0.01 USD in May 2010 to over 67,000 USD in November 2021. Bitcoin is expected to attain newer feats in the coming years as more institutional investors and traders continue to turn to cryptocurrency.

### What Influences Bitcoin’s Price?

The world’s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently taken a substantial hit, dipping below the $25.5K threshold and reaching its lowest value in three months. This downward trend follows a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ).

The news of this legal dispute sparked a swift wave of Bitcoin selling, causing a [ripple](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/ripple-xrp/) effect across the majority of other cryptocurrencies. The market strain has escalated as the SEC has expanded its legal pursuits to encompass Coinbase, another key contender in the cryptocurrency exchange market.

Crypto experts posit that if Bitcoin can hold its resistance level at $26,000, we might see a bounce back in the coming months. However, if this level is breached, Bitcoin could potentially tumble to its lowest ever value of $20,000.

Yet, the experts also caution that the current rise in interest rates and a more stringent monetary policy might hinder Bitcoin from making a significant recovery in the near term.

Despite these hurdles, the year 2023 holds promise for Bitcoin advocates who see it as a “digital safe-haven” or “virtual gold”. These enthusiasts are confident that Bitcoin can offer investors a substantial hedge or attractive yields during periods of market instability.

### Bitcoin Challenges

Despite its success, Bitcoin has faced several criticisms, especially its energy-hungry mining system. According to an energy consumption tracker developed by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 100 TWh per year, about one-third of the UK’s total energy consumption in 2016.

In addition, BTC’s criminality potential has positioned it for more scrutiny, as it has facilitated numerous dark web dealings, such as acquiring illegal weapons, money laundering, etc.

The most significant and long-standing challenge of Bitcoin is scalability. Bitcoin’s underlying technology limits its performance in terms of transaction completion timeframe, with an insufficient capacity of 3-7 TPS. As more transactions are initiated on the network, processing delays will surface. Several proposals have been put forward to nip this concern in the bud, but a favorable long-term fix remains unclear.

### How do you buy and sell Bitcoin?

You can buy and [sell Bitcoin](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-sell-bitcoin-everything-you-need/) through cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. To purchase Bitcoin, you typically need to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, fund your account, and place an order to buy Bitcoin.

### What is Bitcoin’s role in the broader financial system?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen by some as a disruptive force that could challenge traditional financial systems and provide greater financial freedom and autonomy for users.

### Where to store Bitcoin?

The best ways to store Bitcoin include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and software wallets. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure, as they store private keys offline and require physical confirmation of transactions. Paper wallets, which involve printing out private keys and keeping them in a secure location, are also considered secure but require careful handling. Software wallets, which run on computers or mobile devices, are a great option, but more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks.

### What drives the value of BTC?

Bitcoin’s value is determined by supply and demand factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor speculation. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, scarcity, and high-security features also contribute to its value in the market.

Conclusion
----------

Bitcoin has gained the mainstream adoption following massive interest from institutional giants. Some companies, like the Spanish firm Telefonica, now accept Bitcoin. Telefonica even works with a cryptocurrency exchange called Bit2Me to let people pay with Bitcoin.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems to have a bright future with potential for its price to go up. This prediction is based on Bitcoin’s past prices and current market sentiment. Adding Bitcoin to your investment portfolio could be a good move, but it’s important to do your research and understand the risks before buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency

*   [Base meme coins segment loses 24% in 24 hours](#h260)
*   [Crypto liquidations near $400 million](#h348)

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) competitors on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) blockchains are under pressure as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $60,000. In the last seven days, the Base meme crypto scene lost over one-third of its value.

Base meme coins segment loses 24% in 24 hours
---------------------------------------------

The segments of Base (BASE) and Solana (SOL) meme cryptocurrencies are yet again among the most affected categories of altcoins hit by a massive crypto price flush. In the last 24 hours, meme coins on Base (BASE) saw almost 24% of their capitalization erased.

![Image 1: Base meme coins under biggest pressure](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/47837_1.png)

_Image by_ [_CoinGecko_](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories)

Among all Base (BASE) meme coins, the biggest losses are registered by low-cap assets. However, flagship coins of the Base (BASE) meme crypto ecosystem - BRETT, DEGEN, HIGHER - also witnessed 10%-15% drops. 

Cat-themed meme coins represent the fifth worst affected category on CoinGecko, with 17% lost overnight. However, its leaders - Cat In The Dog World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) - printed tiny 3-4% losses and, therefore, even outperformed the crypto market as a whole.

The Solana (SOL) meme coin ecosystem lost 15% in 24 hours with leaders WIF, BONK and BOME only erasing 1-6% of their prices.

As covered by U.Today previously, meme coins on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) were also hit by last weekend's price plunge.

Crypto liquidations near $400 million
-------------------------------------

In the last 24 hours, total capitalization of cryptocurrency markets plummeted by 3.9%. Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, lost 5.7% of its value.

This flush can be attributed to the end of Binance's CZ trial and the paltry start of Hong Kong crypto-based spot ETFs.

As a result, numerous Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin futures traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over $390 million in positions, mostly longs, were erased, CoinGlass's data [shows](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData).

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are responsible for $250 million of this sum.

*   **Elliptic has published new research on Bitcoin money laundering.**
*   **The latest study continues previous research published by the firm in 2019.**
*   **The firm uncovered an emerging trend in BTC money laundering.**

[Blockchain](https://dailycoin.com/tag/blockchain/) forensics firm Elliptic said Wednesday it has made significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify [Bitcoin](https://dailycoin.com/bitcoin-btc-birth-cryptocurrency-blockchain-revolution/) transactions made by illicit actors.

Elliptic published its first research in 2019 after training a machine learning model using over 200,00 transactions. In the second research, published on May 1, the firm trained the model using a vast dataset containing nearly 200 million transactions.

**New Bitcoin Money Laundering Pattern**
----------------------------------------

In a [blogpost](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai) spotlighting the new research, Elliptic said it had detected potential money laundering instances on the Bitcoin network after training the machine learning model to identify “subgraphs,” chain of transactions representing BTC being laundered.

“By identifying these subgraphs rather than illicit wallets, this approach allows us to focus on the “multi-hop laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors,” Elliptic said.

Of 52 “money laundering” subgraphs predicted by the model and which ended up with deposits to an exchange involved in the research, 14 were confirmed to have been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to possible money laundering.

The research further uncovered new types of emerging money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin network, such as the use of “intermediary nested” in certain ways.

Intermediary nested services include businesses that move funds through accounts at larger exchanges, often without the exchange’s awareness in the case of illicit activity.

“Nested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering.” Elliptic described.

The latest research was co-authored by Elliptic and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers.

Bitcoin miners' revenue drops to a 6-month low

URL Source: https://finbold.com/capitulation-incoming-bitcoin-miners-revenue-drops-to-a-6-month-low/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T15:13:01+00:00

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) price shambled post-halving, with consecutive losses and the first [“red month” in April, after a 7-month green streak](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-red-alert-as-7-month-green-streak-ends-how-bad-is-it/). In this context, the Bitcoin miners’ revenue in USD dropped to a 6-month low, slightly above $30 million.

Finbold retrieved [data](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/miners-revenue) from _Blockchain.com_ on May 1, showing $30.17 million of miners’ revenue collected on April 30. Moreover, the 1-year chart illustrates this as the lowest revenue for Bitcoin miners in the past six months.

Notably, the most significant drop occurred after Bitcoin’s fourth halving, when the block subsidy reward changed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per mined block, drastically affecting the activity’s profitability.

### Picks for you

However, the situation worsened as the Bitcoin price in USD moved from around $70,000 to $57,000 month-over-month.

Bitcoin miners underwater, mining with losses as revenue drops
--------------------------------------------------------------

As reported by Finbold on April 23, [Bitcoin miners are “underwater” with increased production costs](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-underwater-as-production-costs-surge-post-halving/), mining BTC with losses. At that time, data from different sources estimated losses from $36,000 to $52,000 per [Bitcoin mined](https://finbold.com/guide/bitcoin-mining-guide/), with BTC trading at $66,000.

Again, this situation worsened amid the most recent [cryptocurrency market](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) crash, which [liquidated long-position traders by $400 million](https://finbold.com/long-position-traders-lost-400-million-in-a-24-hour-bloodbath/). According to the previous sources, Bitcoin miners could be losing between $43,000 and $72,000 per BTC in this revenue drop.

In particular, _Capriole Investments_ has the most pessimistic production cost estimation of $128,989 per mined Bitcoin. The investment firm estimates that $77,400 is spent on electrical costs for each produced coin, considering [hashrate](https://finbold.com/guide/hashrate/#) averages.

Meanwhile, [data](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost) from _MacroMicro_ shows a less-worse cost/price ratio of 1.66, according to estimates from _Cambridge University_. As per this data, Bitcoin’s average mining cost was above $100,500 on April 30, close to historical highs in production costs, with miners theoretically losing around $43,000 for each BTC they issue.

Therefore, current data suggests potential industry turmoil that could cause some Bitcoin mining companies to capitulate. To prevent that, the Bitcoin price would need to rally above the estimated production costs, now at all-time highs.

If the production costs remain higher than the mining rewards, measured in U.S. dollars, the Bitcoin network could centralize in a few big miners. Experts have [warned](https://twitter.com/ColinLeMahieu/status/1778052049319412079) about that for years, mentioning the Economy of Scale dynamics inherent to Bitcoin, which threatens the system’s security.

After a multi-year investigation, US authorities charged Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) with violating money laundering rules in November 2023. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine and exit the US market. The deal also involved CZ stepping down as company CEO, paying a $50 million fine, and pleading guilty to money laundering.

After months of legal limbo, Judge Richard Jones finally gave sentencing on April 30, ordering that CZ serve a four-month prison sentence. CZ responded by saying, “I will do my time,” and move forward after the ordeal is over. 

Looking to the Future
---------------------

Responding to the sentencing, CZ put on a brave face, stating that he intends to serve his sentence and put the matter behind him once it is done. Looking to the future, CZ stated that he will remain a passive crypto investor and plans to “focus on the next chapter of my life (education).”

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).
&gt; 
&gt; I will remain a…
&gt; 
&gt; — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While awaiting sentencing in the US, CZ had already set in motion Giggle Academy, a [free basic education platform](https://dailycoin.com/ex-binance-chief-changpeng-zhao-teases-new-educational-project/) for young students. Notably, it will not feature any cryptocurrency-related content.

The former Binance CEO thanked those who supported him during this ordeal. He stated that the messages of support and backing kept him strong through this uncertain period of his life.

Despite the prison sentence, many in the crypto industry consider CZ a victim of the “[war on crypto](https://dailycoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-defends-crypto-crackdown/)” by US authorities. His guilty plea to money laundering violations enabled Binance to avoid further enforcement actions.

However, in delivering the sentence, Judge Jones clarified that CZ is responsible for Binance’s compliance failings.

CZ Expresses Regret 
--------------------

In handing down sentencing, [Judge Jones stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison-.html) that CZ had the “wherewithal, finance capabilities, and people power” to ensure Binance complied with money laundering regulations. However, the judge determined that CZ “failed at that opportunity.”

While prosecutors had pushed for a [three-year prison term](https://dailycoin.com/u-s-doj-asks-changpeng-zhao-cz-to-be-jailed-for-3-years/), Judge Jones opted to show a degree of leniency by handing down a four-month sentence instead. The relatively light punishment suggested the court recognized CZ’s conduct in trying to resolve the case as quickly as possible.

Addressing the court, CZ stated that the sentence represents “the first step of taking responsibility.” He admitted his failure to “implement an adequate anti-money laundering program” at Binance, stating, “I realize now the seriousness of that mistake.”

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The average** **prison sentence** **for** **money laundering** **is** [**70 months**](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Money_Laundering_FY19.pdf)**, according to the** **US Sentencing Commission****.**
*   **Since the enforcement action,** **Binance****‘s global** **market share** **has** [**dropped to 55%**](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/7165350385162)**.**

Why This Matters
----------------

As much as the crypto industry paints a picture of decentralization and operating independently of legacy systems, CZ’s sentencing is evidence that authorities can pull anyone back into their jurisdiction if they choose.

### **Making A Fortune In Artificial Intelligence**

Please [click here](https://thearorareport.com/chart-analysis-stock-market-fomc-meeting-powell-rate-decision-smci-mc-05012024) for an enlarged chart of **Super Micro Computer Inc** SMCI.

Note the following:

*   This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of SMCI stock is being used to illustrate the point.
*   Super Micro has been the most favorite artificial intelligence stock of the momo crowd. The chart shows the big drop in the stock on earnings released after the market closed.
*   The chart shows a 40.5% drop since the high in March.
*   RSI shown on the chart foretold what was to come.
*   The momo crowd, including momo gurus, that ran up the stock did not really understand the server business.
*   **SMCI presents an important learning moment for prudent investors. These are four important points here:**
*   **What you do not buy is as important as what you buy.**  
*   **A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.**  
*   **The momo crowd’s history is that they make money because they run up stocks with their own buying. Subsequently, the momo crowd loses money when smart money sells into the strength. Often, the momo crowd loses more money than they make, resulting in a net loss.**   
*   **Follow smart money for investments. Selectively follow the momo crowd for very short term trades when there is a Signal or Signal Limited.**  
*   Members and readers of The Arora Report, already knew in advance what was to come. On March 4, right near the top of SMCI stock, [we wrote](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/03/37461504/yolo-rears-its-ugly-head-in-the-stock-market-bitcoin-hits-65k-target-opec-extends-production-cuts):

*   &gt; SMCI has become a favorite of the momo crowd. The momo crowd incorrectly thinks SMCI has the same potential as Nvidia (NVDA). Investors need to keep in mind the following:

*   &gt; SMCI moves a lot more than NVDA. SMCI is so volatile because of the small float.

*   &gt; SMCI is an assembler of servers for artificial intelligence. It uses components from NVDA, Micron (MU), and Marvell (MRVL).

*   &gt; NVDA has a large moat to protect it that includes IP for its GPUs. SMCI has no moat and the barrier to entry for competitors is low.

*   &gt; SMCI sales are to hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG). The reason SMCI sales are booming is that they have availability of NVDA chips. As chips become more available to competitors, SMCI will not be able to sustain its sales growth rate.

*   &gt; The momo crowd is buying SMCI due to lack of knowledge.  However, there are many investors who understand and have the knowledge of SMCI's business. Many such investors are short selling SMCI.  For the time being, short sellers are being overwhelmed by the YOLO crowd.

*   &gt; Taking all of the above into consideration with the [quantitative analysis screen](https://thearorareport.com/zyx-quantitative-screen) of the ZYX Change Method, in an optimistic case, the fair value of SMCI stock is $442 - $486.


*   You may recall that The Arora Report was the first one to identify that artificial intelligence was real in 2022. At that time, momo gurus were selling AI stock.
*   A fortune is to be made in AI between now and 2030.  SMCI shows that at times it will be treacherous. You need expert guidance.  Equally important is building your knowledge of investments in AI. 
*   **FOMC will release its decision at 2pm ET today. FOMC is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. The key event is Powell’s conference. The data shows that professional traders are expecting higher volatility during Powell’s conference than at any other point over the last year.** 
*   **In The Arora Report analysis, the near term direction of the stock market will come down to if objective Powell shows up or if political Powell shows up.**  
*   **If objective Powell shows up, expect the stock market to go down.  The reason is that the stock market is still levitating on hopium and not paying attention to the data.**  
*   **If political Powell shows up, expect a rip roaring rally.** 
*   We previously shared that prudent investors should pay attention to the Treasury refunding plan.
*   The Treasury plans to borrow $243B in the April to June quarter vs. $202B estimate.
*   The Treasury has just released the composition of the borrowing.
*   In The Arora Report analysis, the composition is more important than the increased amount of borrowing. Last time, the Treasury manipulated the borrowing to make stock and bond markets run higher. We will be carefully analyzing the just released new data.
*   Automatic Data Processing Inc ADP is the largest private payroll processor in the country.  It uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture in advance of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.  ADP employment change came at 192K vs. 175K consensus.  This indicates that the jobs picture is staying very strong.  In The Arora Report analysis, the strength is at the low end while the job picture remains weak in IT and finance.

### **Bitcoin**

**Bitcoin** BTC/USD has fallen below $60,000 on momo crowd selling.  Recent momo crowd bitcoin buyers who fell prey to whales’ propaganda of buying on bitcoin halving and bought bitcoin above $70,000 are panicking and selling. Of course, if you listened to the podcast on bitcoin halving, you knew in advance that this was a high probability outcome.

### **Protection Band And What To Do Now**

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

**It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.**  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

### **Traditional 60/40 Portfolio**

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

**The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Markdown Content:
Former President **Donald Trump's** [crypto portfolio](https://www.benzinga.com/money/maga-trump-price-prediction) is taking a heavy hit, as **Bitcoin** plummeted below the $58,000 mark.

**What Happened:** Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence [data](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) shows Donald Trump's wallet is currently valued at $5.17 million—meaning the former President’s portfolio has seens a drawdown of over $1 million in the last two days alone.

The largest holding of the portfolio is 579,290 tokens of **MAGA Memecoin** TRUMP/USD, valued at $2.48 million. The token is a meme coin that endorses Trump and has gained significant attention since launching last summer. When the project launched, the creators sent 580,000 TRUMP tokens to the former president’s wallet address.

Trump also holds 421.375 **Ethereum** ETH/USD, worth $1.22 million and 374.5 **WETH** WETH/USD, worth $1.08 million.

**Why It Matters:** Trump began take an interest in cryptocurrency in late 2022, when his name, image, and likeness were used to market and sell the [Trump Digital Trading Cards](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38222451/original-trump-nft-collection-trading-volume-plunges-99-in-past-30-days-ahead-of-criminal-) non-fungible token (NFT) collection.

Since its launch in September 2023, the TRUMP meme coin has rocketed to an all-time high of over $400 million in market capitalization but has lost over 50% of its value from that peak.

Whether Trump will sell his portfolio to realize losses is unknown. However, Trump has said he has “fun” with “[crazy new currencies](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38530092/donald-trump-says-he-has-fun-with-crypto-despite-losing-over-3-million-in-60-days)“—albeit that was during more favorable market conditions. 

**What's Next**: The influence of meme coins and [Bitcoin as an institutional asset class](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment) are topics expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga's upcoming [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) event on Nov. 19.

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/tether-smashes-former-net-profit-record

Markdown Content:
Stablecoin issuer Tether has notched a record quarterly net profit at a time during which the company is broadening its scope. 

Tether tallied an all-time high net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter, according to a Wednesday attestation report by auditing firm BDO. 

Tether’s first quarter net operating profits of $1 billion were driven by its US Treasury holdings, the company added. Other profits stemmed from mark-to-market gains in its bitcoin and gold positions.

Bitcoin’s price hit a new peak of about $73,000 in mid-March before trending downward in April.

The $4.52 billion total obliterates the former record of $2.85 billion in net profit gathered during the last three months of 2023.

Tether’s token, [USDT](https://blockworks.co/tag/usdt), is intended to maintain a value of $1 and can be redeemed for US dollars at any time.  

As of March 31, [Tether](https://blockworks.co/tag/tether)’s reserves were nearly $6.3 billion higher than the liabilities of the companies issuing USDT.  

USDT’s market capitalization was roughly $110 billion at 10 am ET, behind only bitcoin and ether among crypto assets. That figure is more than triple the $33 billion market cap of competing stablecoin USDC. 

The latest disclosure comes as Tether seeks to build out its business beyond just [stablecoins](https://blockworks.co/tag/stablecoins).

It recently launched a data initiative focused on developing and investing in new technology, for example. Other new divisions include a unit focused on blockchain-based financial infrastructure and one involved in the [mining](https://blockworks.co/tag/mining) and energy sectors. 

“With this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what’s possible in this world,” CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement last month.
