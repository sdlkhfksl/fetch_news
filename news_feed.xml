The collective value of cryptocurrency compromised by hacking plummeted by 67% in April to $60.2 million. This marks a notable reduction in crypto attacks, representing the first significant decline this year.

The fall of 67% marks a sharp decline from the $187.6 million hacked in March, which pales in comparison to the $360.8 million worth of hacked digital assets in April, according to a May 1 X [post](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1785631890470572421/photo/1) by on-chain security firm Peckshield.

The monthly total of $60.2 million was stolen from 40 individual hacking incidents. Hacks and exploits have been among the main issues plaguing trust in cryptocurrencies along with mainstream adoption.

The [$44.7 million hack on Hedgey Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedgey-protocol-44-million-exploit), a token infrastructure platform, represented the largest incident in April. The hackers exploited a vulnerability in Hedgey’s token claim contract on the Arbitrum Network on April 19.

The second-largest hacking incident saw $3 million worth of crypto stolen from the Fixed Float crypto exchange due to a vulnerability with a third-party service provider used by the exchange, according to FixedFloat’s April 2 X [post](https://twitter.com/FixedFloat/status/1775172224216875223).

The third-largest attack, on Grand Base, netted hackers $2.67 million worth of digital assets, while the fourth-largest [hack, on Pike Finance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pike-finance-exploited-1-6-million-second-exploit-3-days), resulted in a loss of $1.6 million worth of funds.

Fueling investor concerns, the $1.6 million attack was the second hack suffered by Pike Finance within three days, after a $300,000 exploit on April 26.

The two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract, [according](https://twitter.com/PikeFinance/status/1785572875124330644) to a May 1 X post by Pike Finance.

Crypto hacks down over 25% year-to-date compared to 2023
--------------------------------------------------------

The crypto space saw a total of over $401 million worth of hacks and rug pulls in 2024 year-to-date (YTD), which represents a 25.1% decrease compared to the same period last year, which saw over $536 million worth of hacked funds, according to a May 1 [report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/2FlKal41QbUO206gQAcNOr/43ccdf6d0aed156a5d22320d7ab702bb/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_In_April_2024.pdf) by crypto bounty platform Immunefi.

According to Immunefi’s figures, $53 million was lost to hacks and fraud across 21 incidents in April, representing a 46% decrease from April 2023, when attackers stole over $98 million worth of digital assets.

Hacks remained the main cause of losses, accounting for over 94.3% of the lost funds during the month.

Markdown Content:
**As Bitcoin prices continue to face intense [volatility](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/) after the halving, the stability of the entire crypto-mining industry could hinge on a critical support level.** 

Currently trading around $57,000, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop from its March 14 all-time high of $73,750. This downturn places immense pressure on Bitcoin miners, who grapple with the effects of the latest halving event that reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.

Will Bitcoin Miners Capitulate Following the Halving?
-----------------------------------------------------

Despite these challenges, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently [highlighted](https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1785171733454143633) that [Bitcoin miners](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-miner-revenue-runes-post-halving/) have yet to show signs of capitulation. Typically, capitulation occurs when miners, unable to cover operational costs due to falling Bitcoin prices, are forced to sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down further. 

However, Ju’s analysis suggests miners hold onto their assets, betting on a future price recovery.

&gt; “Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped to levels seen in early 2023 following the halving. Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in BTC price. There are no signs of capitulation for now,” Ju said.

This optimism is echoed by some analysts who foresee a potential recovery. Following the previous halvings, [Bitcoin usually undergoes price fluctuations,](https://beincrypto.com/bullish-altcoins-outshine-bitcoin-may/) historically leading to rallies due to increased asset scarcity. This pattern suggests a possible price uplift, aligning with the miners’ decision to hold.

However, Charles Edwards, Founder of Capriole Investments, [believes](https://x.com/caprioleio/status/1782268940397236432) the recent downward price action could soon wreak havoc on Bitcoin miners. The electricity cost to operate the Bitcoin network is currently an astonishing $77,400 per BTC mined. This figure represents the direct energy expenses associated with mining each Bitcoin.

When the price falls below the electrical cost, it typically lasts only a few days every four years. According to Edwards, this scenario can lead to one of three outcomes: 

1.  The price of Bitcoin could surge dramatically.
2.  Approximately 15% of miners might cease operations.
3.  Transaction fees could remain significantly higher than average.

For this reason, the market’s next movements are highly anticipated, with [analysts keenly watching the $57,000 level](https://beincrypto.com/microstrategy-buys-122-bitcoin-april/). If this support breaks, it could trigger a wave of sales from miners, fulfilling the capitulation scenario.

Short Announced the Altcoins He Closed!

URL Source: https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bear-analyst-il-capo-evaluated-bitcoin-decline-and-shared-his-latest-predictions-short-announced-the-altcoins-he-closed/

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, spent April with declines. As the declines continued on the first day of May, BTC fell below $ 57,000.

While the decline in BTC is getting deeper, Capo of Crypto, who is known for his bearish views and is frequently criticized by investors with his bearish comments, made a new assessment after today's decline in Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market.

Stating that BTC reached its previous target of $57,000-59,000 and Ethereum reached $2,700-2,800, il Capo said that a local bottom could be seen at these levels.

However, the analyst stated that there is a strong demand below these levels and said that he will not enter any position until he sees a strong downward reaction or approval in BTC and altcoins and that he will be careful before taking a position.

Also adding that he closed CRO and BNB shorts profitably, il Capo added that there is a possibility of further decline.

&gt; “BTC reached its base level of $57k – $59k, while ETH reached $2700 – $2800. What should we expect now?
&gt; 
&gt; We can see a local bottom formation here, but for that we need a strong bullish PA.
&gt; 
&gt; There is significant demand below these levels, and that's a good thing. But I will be careful before entering any position until I see a strong reaction or confirmation.
&gt; 
&gt; I made a profit on my CRO and BNB shorts. They may fall further, but profits are already very good and we are currently at support level.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's see how prices react here. For now, I'm going to wait until we see a reversal.”

URL Source: https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/synfutures-v3-overtakes-uniswap-and-dydx-by-daily-trade-volume

Published Time: 2024-05-01T12:38:00.000Z

Markdown Content:
Points farmers have driven SynFutures v3's daily DEX dominance up to 12%.

SynFutures v3, the surging decentralized exchange for perpetual futures, has emerged as the top DEX by 24-hour trading volume with $1.47 billion.

According to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/), SynFutures v3 accounted for 12% dominance over decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in the last 24 hours. SynFutures beat out the top spot decentralized exchange, Uniswap, and incumbent perpetuals DEX, dYdX V4 — which boast market shares of 11.3% and 11.2% respectively.

SynFutures has risen to the top of the decentralized exchange rankings despite the platform managing a total value locked (TVL) of only $50.47 million, according to data from DefiLlama.

For comparison, GMX v2, a top decentralized perpetuals exchange, boasts a TVL of $325 million, while dYdX holds $320 million, and the Jupiter Perpetual Exchange hosts $291 million.

SynFutures is the latest example of web3 protocol quickly establishing impressive market share on the back of a successful [points campaign](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/eigenlayer-to-drop-token-on-may-10).

The project launched its v3 iteration on the Blast Ethereum Layer 2 in February and [unveiled](https://medium.com/synfutures/introducing-synfutures-oyster-odyssey-program-2-0-trading-incentives-unlocked-e025bb5e6266) a points campaign dubbed “Oyster Odyssey” in March. Oyster Odyssey incentivizes users who contribute liquidity or refer other users onto the platform with points, which are expected to qualify holders for an airdrop in the future.

SynFutures said it onboarded more than 400,000 users within two weeks of launching the points campaign.

Oyster AMM
----------

SynFutures v3 also introduced a new exchange mechanism dubbed the Oyster AMM.

Oyster AMM combines elements from order book trading and automated market makers (AMMs) to increase capital efficiency compared to traditional AMM decentralized exchanges.

AMMs were pioneered by Uniswap v1, and allow users to execute trades by interacting with smart contract-based liquidity pools. Liquidity providers supply assets to the pools in exchange for earning trading fees, while price data is provided by third-party oracles, facilitating permissionless on-chain trading.

"Oyster AMM embraces two-sided liquidity but only requires a single token, eliminating the need to provide liquidity for both ends of a token pair and enhancing the overall efficiency of the trading ecosystem,” Synfutures [said](https://medium.com/synfutures/synfutures-v3-launches-on-blast-mainnet-offering-3x-points-through-oyster-odyssey-ahead-of-token-e528cbeb6212).

The first version of SynFutures launched in June 2021 on the Polygon PoS Sidechain and zkSync Era networks. The protocol offered a Synthetic AMM, requiring that liquidity providers only provide a single asset to pools rather than both sides of a pairing.

In December 2022, the project launched SynFutures v2, allowing users to list futures pairings permissionlessly.

SynFutures v3 is already outperforming its previous incarnations, with daily trade volume on v2 peaking at $30.1 million alongside a TVL of just $6.5 million, while v1’s TVL topped out at $7.85 million.

Collectively, v1 and v2 have processed roughly [$23 billion](https://messari.io/report/state-of-synfutures-q3-2023) in trade volume from more than 10,000 users, according to Messari. However, SynFutures v3 beat out its past incarnations during April alone, with the exchange hosting more than $30.1 billion worth of trades last month.

21Shares analyst predicts that tokenized government securities could reach 10% market share.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, has surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to become the world’s largest equity tokenized fund, with $375 million in assets under management (AUM) as of April 30, according to [data](https://dune.com/queries/3095612/5164331) from Dune Analytics.

As of April 28, Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX held the previous top position with $376 million in AUM while BlackRock’s BUIDL was close behind with $349 million in AUM.

The growth comes just six weeks after BUIDL’s debut. The AUM gap between BUIDL and FOBXX widened to $8 million, with BUIDL taking the lead.

[BlackRock launched BUIDL](https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-buidl-tokenized-fund-ethereum/) in partnership with Securitize in March 2024. The fund [captured over $240 million](https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-tokenized-fund-inflows/) in its first week. Last week, BUIDL attracted $70 million, including a significant $50 million from its OUSG token product, Ondo Finance. Meanwhile, FOBXX experienced a 3.7% decrease in its AUM.

The tokenization of real assets is heating up following BlackRock’s participation. Last week, Franklin Templeton announced that it has [enabled direct shareholder transfers](https://cryptobriefing.com/franklin-templeton-benji-token-peer-transfers/) of FOBXX shares on the public blockchain, a move seen as the fund’s efforts to hold its leading position in the market.

Tokenized government securities gain momentum in the asset market
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In a recent post on X, 21Shares analyst Tom Wan suggested that tokenized government securities could grow in their share of the total tokenized asset market, moving from about 1% currently to over 10%.

&gt; 4/ Prediction: Tokenized Government Securities will increase its dominance from 1% to 10%+
&gt; 
&gt; In Jan 2023, Tokenized government securities only accounted for 0.1% of the total tokenized value. Today, it represents ~1.4% of the total tokenized value.

According to Wan, the current demand for tokenized traditional financial assets is not strong. Even among investors who are familiar with crypto, there is a hesitancy to invest in tokenized equities due to low liquidity.

Despite these challenges, there’s a better outlook for tokenizing assets like US Treasuries because there’s already remarkable demand within the crypto space, Wan noted.

Tether Holdings, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)), reported a record net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

Tether also revealed its net equity for the first time, which stands at $11.37 billion as of March 31. This represents a significant increase from the $7.01 billion worth of equity recorded at the end of December 2023, [according](https://tether.io/news/tether-releases-q1-2024-attestation-reports-record-breaking-4-52-billion-profit-highest-treasury-bill-ownership-percentage-ever-total-group-equity-of-11-37-billion/) to Tether’s attestation report for the first quarter of 2024.

Approximately $1 billion stemmed from operating profits derived from United States Treasury holdings, while the remainder of $3.52 billion comprised the market-to-market gains in the firm’s Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and gold positions.

Tether’s USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin, worth over $110 billion, [according](https://coinmarketcap.com/) to CoinMarketCap data. The company issued $12.5 billion worth of USDT in the first quarter of 2024.

The report also revealed a $1 billion increase in excess reserves that are maintained as a buffer to support the company’s stablecoin offerings. Tether’s excess reserves stood just below $6.3 billion.

The report further revealed over $104 billion worth of liabilities related to “digital tokens issued,” while the value of Tether’s reserve assets exceeded the value of its liabilities by over $6.2 billion as of March 31.

Tether remains the world’s seventh-largest Bitcoin holder
---------------------------------------------------------

Tether’s Bitcoin wallet, “bc1q,” currently holds 75,354 BTC, worth over $4.38 billion, [according](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4) to on-chain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence.

Tether acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth $626 million from Bitfinex on March 31.

This makes Tether’s “bc1q” address [the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-boosts-bitcoin-reserves), according to [BitInfoCharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html). The firm said it would invest 15% of its net profit into Bitcoin to diversify the stablecoin’s backing assets.

Despite Bitcoin falling below the $60,000 mark, Tether is sitting on an unrealized profit of over 91%, worth over $2 billion, [according](https://coinstats.app/address/bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4/) to the CoinStats portfolio tracker.

URL Source: https://beincrypto.com/azuki-nft-sales-surge-crypto-market-falls/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T12:20:56+00:00

Markdown Content:
**As the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging to its lowest since February, Ethereum-based Azuki soared to new heights in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector.**

Azuki’s sales reached a striking $1.13 million, marking it as the top-selling NFT collection of the day, according to CryptoSlam data.

Azuki NFT Sales Are Booming as Crypto Market Drops
--------------------------------------------------

The contrast between the declining crypto market and Azuki’s sales spike is stark. [Bitcoin fell about 6.3%](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-drops-57000-reversal/) over the past 24 hours, dropping below the critical $60,000 support level.

Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) saw a decrease of around 5%, falling under $3,000, with other major altcoins such as [Solana](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/) ([SOL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/)) and [Avalanche](https://beincrypto.com/learn/avalanche-avax/) (AVAX) also losing about 6%. The overall crypto market capitalization has dropped by over $20 billion, highlighted by the $540 million [outflow from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-zero-inflows/) since April 20.

According to 10x Research, the average entry price for US Bitcoin ETF holders is around $57,300, which may serve as a pivotal support point if the downtrend continues.

&gt; “There might have been a lot of ‘TradeFi’ tourists in crypto – pushing longs until the halving – this time is now over. We expect more unwinding as the average Bitcoin ETF buyer will be underwater when Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to our target levels and cause a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top – hence our price target of $52,000 to $55,000 during the last three weeks,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen [wrote](https://mail.10xresearch.co/p/bitcoin-miners-sell-5bn-btc-post-halving-altcoin-graveyard).

The cryptocurrency market’s instability contrasts with the thriving NFT sector. Azuki [emerged](https://www.cryptoslam.io/nfts) as the only collection to achieve over $1 million in sales. This surge has pushed Azuki’s total sales volume to approximately $1.12 billion. Subsequently, positioning it as the eighth-largest NFT collection in terms of sales.

Other NFT collections like DMarket and Dokyo also witnessed considerable sales but trailed behind Azuki. DMarket, featuring in-game items on the Mythos network, garnered nearly $887,880, while Avalanche-based Dokyo accumulated about $716,860 from 948 transactions.

Noteworthy, too, is the Bored [Ape](https://beincrypto.com/learn/apecoin/) Yacht Club ([BAYC](https://beincrypto.com/learn/bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc/)) and CryptoPunks, each recording just over $500,000 in sales, showing resilience amidst a challenging market. These figures reflect a growing divergence where select [NFT collections](https://beincrypto.com/learn/nft-marketing-agency/) continue to attract significant investment despite broader market challenges.

This trend suggests a robust, enduring interest in high-value NFTs like Azuki, even as traditional cryptocurrencies face [volatility](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/).

Dog-themed cryptocurrency [Shiba Inu (SHIB)](https://u.today/shiba-inu-might-be-on-verge-of-reversal-as-470-trillion-shib-support-looms) has experienced a significant price drop in the last 24 hours, shedding nearly 15% of its value. At the time of writing, SHIB had trimmed some of its intraday losses and was down 10.36% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002097. 

On-chain data suggests that the actions of short-term traders may have precipitated the SHIB price downturn. In this regard, [IntoTheBlock](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=all&amp;chart=all)'s holding time of transacted coins indicator seems to offer a clue to Shiba Inu's current investor sentiment. 

The holding time of transacted coins indicator often provides powerful insights into the level of investor confidence and market sentiment.

For SHIB, the holding time of transacted coins stays low, between two weeks and one month, suggesting investors are now more focused on short-term gains.

On April 30, when the SHIB price dropped considerably, the average time held of coins transacted was one month, indicating activity from short-term traders who had bought at the peak of Shiba Inu's rally in March.

![Image 2: TradingView](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/01052024%200000.png)

[_SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingView_](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XaNG1RUn/)

Shiba Inu rapidly surged to highs of $0.000045 in early March, which was followed by profit-taking. As buying pressure remained on the market, Shiba Inu managed to pan out highs of $0.00003285 on March 28 before steadily declining in the weeks that followed.

While the influence of short-term traders remains, it might be essential to consider the broader market context. 

The entire cryptocurrency market, driven by [Bitcoin](https://u.today/key-reason-why-bitcoin-btc-fell-to-one-week-low-details), is experiencing substantial losses. Bitcoin fell over 9% on Wednesday, posting its worst monthly performance in April since late 2022, as investors withdrew money from cryptocurrencies ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today.

However, the good news is that [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-at-crossroads-as-69-trillion-shib-hangs-in-balance) appears to be forming a bull flag on the daily chart. According to crypto analyst Ali, validating this pattern might trigger fresh highs for the Shiba Inu price.

A price rebound from about $0.000018343 might lead to a bullish breakout, sending SHIB prices to highs of $0.000072323.

*   **Over $479 million liquidated in 24 hours as Bitcoin plunges 9% to $56K.**
*   **The largest single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving $6 million.**
*   **Despite the massive sell-off, analysts remain optimistic about a bullish comeback.**

After the overly bearish April, the crypto market is again starting the new month of May on a red note, with crypto traders languishing in staggering capital losses. [Data](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) from market tracker Coinglass shows that 141,808 crypto traders faced liquidation over the last day. These traders have lost over $479 million in their investment across various assets. 

The most significant single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving an ETH-USDT-SWAP valued at $6.07 million. This nearly half-billion-dollar fortune wiped out of the crypto scene emerged following Bitcoin’s instability in the last 24 hours. 

As of yesterday, Bitcoin traded at a high of $62,121. However, at press time, it had already plummeted by 9% to trade at a low of $56,555. This sudden turn of events has left crypto bulls reeling from significant losses.

In particular, crypto bulls lost over $401 billion within the past day, while shorters lost only about $63 million. The losses were more pronounced for Bitcoin optimists than other assets, with $150 million liquidated at press time. 

On the other hand, Ethereum investors who bet for higher prices have incurred $107 million in liquidation. Significant liquidations were also recorded for other prominent assets like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Bitcoin’s retest of the $56K range comes about two weeks after the [Bitcoin network halved on April 19](https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-sold-8k-last-halving-soared-721-after-will-history-repeat/). Prior to the halving event, there was similar intense selling pressure in the market, with Bitcoin crashing to $60K from the recently attained all-time high of $73,850.  
In his latest analysis, market watcher Rekt Capital has [highlighted](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785590508288389203) that Bitcoin’s revisit of $56K is officially the deepest retrace in this emerging bull cycle. Accordingly, market analysts continue to [maintain](https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1785564391141757222) confidence that the bullish comeback is around the corner.

### Crypto News Key Highlights:

*   In April, private sector employment surged by 192,000 jobs, with annual pay rising by 5.0% year-over-year, as per the April ADP National Employment Report, produced by ADP Research Institute in collaboration with Stanford Digital Economy Lab. It offers an independent, high-frequency view of the private-sector labor market using anonymized payroll data of over 25 million US employees.

*   The [Enforcement Directorate in India has launched its crypto wallet](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/ed-uses-its-crypto-wallet-to-tackle-the-criminals"EnforcementDirectorate") to counter financial crime involving cryptocurrencies, following a major fraud by the "E Nugget" gaming app. With advanced tech partnerships and software development, ED aims to enhance cyber forensics and combat evolving criminal tactics, potentially reshaping India's crypto landscape.

*   [BlackRock launches BUIDL](https://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-currency-news/blackrocks-buidl-is-big-hitter-to-the-crypto-market"BlackRock") , the largest tokenized fund on Ethereum, surpassing Franklin Templeton's fund in six weeks. BUIDL's market cap reaches $375 million, driven by $70 million inflow last week. CEO Larry Fink advocates for blockchain efficiency. Despite low demand, BUIDL offers liquidity and stability via US treasury bill trading.

*   Victoria Jacobs, aka Bakhrom Talipov, received an 18-year prison sentence for funding Syrian terrorism with Bitcoin. She laundered over $12,000 for terrorist groups using cryptocurrency. Regulatory ambiguity surrounding crypto enables such crimes, while countries like the UK strengthen regulations to combat crypto-related crime effectively.

*   Approximately 50 Beribit users attempted to storm the exchange's Moscow offices demanding $4 million in digital assets. Withdrawal issues prompted chaos, with employees blocked from leaving. Management cited balance sheet discrepancies, initiating an audit causing delays. Reassuring statements were followed by failure to reimburse, with only police-complaining users compensated.

*   Between 2022 and 2023, a UK financial report highlighted crypto firms, alongside banking sectors, as the highest risk for money laundering. The Financial Conduct Authority's scrutiny of 238 firms revealed this risk. UK authorities have been intensifying efforts, with police seizing millions in crypto assets and dedicated personnel supervising anti-money laundering measures.

*   Sell in May and Go Away, a strategy introduced by Alfred Fielding in the 1970s, suggests selling assets in May and buying back in November. Though historically supported, its effectiveness varies. For instance, S&amp;P 500 returns an average of 0.18% in May. While it impacts stocks, its influence on cryptocurrencies is less pronounced, with sporadic alignment observed.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-wormhole-key-for-web3-growth-cross-chain/

Markdown Content:
Wormhole is one of the most widely used and known cross-chain bridges. The hub has proven resilient, despite going through one of the biggest exploits, losing $321M in 2022. Since then, Wormhole has grown its connection pairs and interchain features. 

Wormhole Targets Developers Again
---------------------------------

Developers are a scarce resource in the [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/) space. The best may create the next wave of successful projects. Wormhole and Borderless Capital are offering grants to developers who want to create cross-chain features and products. 

The grant program is open for application now and will distribute a total of $50M in locked liquidity. 

&gt; .[@borderless\_cap](https://twitter.com/borderless_cap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has launched a $50 million fund to onboard the next generation of Web3 applications.
&gt; 
&gt; All builders, founders, and developers innovating cutting-edge apps, infrastructure, or tools that span multiple ecosystems are invited to apply. [pic.twitter.com/G60JuSNtXI](https://t.co/G60JuSNtXI)
&gt; 
&gt; — Wormhole (@wormhole) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/wormhole/status/1785323250949771492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Wormhole aims to build a space where the end user can move seamlessly between any two chains, without extra steps or attention. Cross-chain tokens and identities also mean more opportunities for account abstraction, where a user does not need to create a new wallet for each chain.

Wormhole Introduces Native Cross-Chain Tokens
---------------------------------------------

The seamless Wormhole technology means there are now tokens that can exist on several networks, with seamless transfers and locked liquidity. Wormhole itself recently launched its W token, available on some of the most high-profile Web3 networks. 

Wormhole is also adding new tokens with cross-chain mechanisms. Some of the recent additions can move between Solana and Arbitrum, two of the most active chains for decentralized apps. 

The activity of Wormhole varies, but the protocol showed an inflow of transactions in Q1, 2024. In the past 90 days, Wormhole also went through activity spikes, with thousands of cross-chain transactions each day. At baseline, Wormhole handles around 2K transactions, based on DappRadar data.

![Image 1: a graph showing the historical volatility of ethereum](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QxViS0tRTxf5_yGm_x2Zi6E12izHfb16BvMisq2bc0vrMUOIx7Xgpg2B0TclCQiix7iwOcyZGcW5pw7rXsFa1wg12YuhlkImWYgQ2lq0bNEF4go4w0l_Vw_6W785GwbKBYD7yYYOtYvPXAV9mPEh_Ew)

The protocol retained its high credibility, especially after increasing security to avoid more exploits. As of May 1, the [Portal bridge by Wormhole](https://defillama.com/bridge/portal-by-wormhole) received more deposits than withdrawals and supports a reasonable level of baseline activity. Wormhole is used often to transfer different cross-chain versions of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD and others.

Wormhole Offers Staking for Native Token
----------------------------------------

One of the reasons for heightened activity is the launch of the W token. Wormhole partnered with DappRadar to further boost W token distribution. W token buyers can stake through DappRadar in a special program and receive passive returns. 

The W token has been trading for only about a month and is still at the stage of early price discovery. W peaked right after its launch, reaching highs of $1.54. Since then, it has slid to its current price of $0.64, trading sideways for the past two weeks. 

![Image 2: a black background with a plane flying in the sky](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

After the initial enthusiasm, W token’s trading volumes remain close to $200M per day, with $1.2M in liquidity for each 2% downward slippage. 

After its launch, the W token also managed to defy the market slide, which pushed down major assets. W climbed while Bitcoin (BTC) slid toward the $60,000 barrier. 

Wormhole’s W reached an all-time low at $0.46 and showed its capabilities to bounce and find a higher price range.

Extreme predictions see W breaking as high as $3 in the medium term, as more buyers redirect to the new asset.

&gt; [$W](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24W&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Expensive? Overpriced? Probably.
&gt; 
&gt; It is however showing quite a lot of strength the past 2 weeks while everything else has been getting rekt.
&gt; 
&gt; Good to keep an eye on as it could easily squeeze higher upon a breakout.
&gt; 
&gt; Best to wait for confirmation as always 🙂 [pic.twitter.com/KiJkDUd19w](https://t.co/KiJkDUd19w)

A further slide for W may put the token in the accumulation zone, preparing for new attempts at trading higher. Some predictions view W as almost done with the slide after the launch. W was intended as a utility token within the ecosystem.

Wormhole Invests Back into Crypto Space
---------------------------------------

Wormhole is a hub for money to enter and flow through crypto space. The project itself is well-funded, [raising $225M](https://icodrops.com/wormhole/) during a token sale in Q4, 2023. Wormhole is one of the projects to delay the creation of a token, surprising the markets with a late but very successful ICO. The bridge and cross-chain platform has been around for more than three years and is among the first tokenless projects to airdrop an asset.

On its side, Wormhole supported seven other projects like Curvance, NodeKit, Synonym Finance, Omega, Oyl, Zoth and Mayan.

Legendary trader [Peter Brandt](https://x.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1785472622542848389), renowned for his insights into financial markets, has suggested a potential pit stop for Bitcoin before its next rally. In the wake of Bitcoin's recent 9% price drop, Brandt's analysis points toward a scenario where the leading cryptocurrency could dip into the high $40,000s before resuming its bullish trajectory.

Brandt's assessment comes amid growing uncertainty following Bitcoin's significant loss since the beginning of the week, marking its largest drop of the year. With prices plummeting from $64,700 to $57,400, market participants have been gripped by panic and doubt regarding the future of [Bitcoin](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-at-end-of-correction-top-analyst-suggests) and the wider crypto market.

![Image 2: ""](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/btcprice_7.png)

_BTC to USD by_ [_CoinMarketCap_](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)

What's resolution?
------------------

Having witnessed numerous market cycles throughout his extensive career, Brandt highlights a crucial observation: despite past halving events and the launch of ETFs, Bitcoin has failed to surpass its highs from three years ago. 

This insight underscores the importance of resolving current market dynamics, especially as [BTC](https://u.today/its-do-or-die-for-bitcoin-btc-now-peter-schiff) struggles to maintain its upward momentum.

Despite acknowledging a 25% probability that Bitcoin had already reached its local peak at $74,000, Brandt remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing bull market. However, he suggests that corrections may accompany this upward trend, with the potential for the [Bitcoin price](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) to correct by more than 25% from current levels.

Notably, Bitcoin has not revisited the $40,000 mark in the past three months, underscoring the significance of Brandt's proposed pit stop.

**Riot Platforms Inc** RIOT shares are trading higher Wednesday on the heels of the **Bitcoin** BTC/USD mining company’s first-quarter results. Here’s a look at the [highlights from the quarter](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/05/g38547512/riot-platforms-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-high).

**What Happened:** Riot Platforms reported first-quarter revenue of $79.3 million, which missed the [consensus estimate](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings) of $94.859 million, per [Benzinga Pro](http://pro.benzinga.com/). The company reported positive earnings of 82 cents per share, beating estimates for a loss of 14 cents per share.

Riot said it produced 1,264 bitcoin during the quarter, down 36% year-over-year. The company said the decline was primarily due to a significant increase in bitcoin network difficulty. Riot anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 31 EH/s by the end of 2024.

“This quarter, Riot reported net income of $211.8 million and earnings per share of $0.82 which are new record highs for our quarterly results. Additionally, we reported $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, another record high for Riot, rounding out strong financial performance for the quarter,” said **Jason Les**, CEO of Riot.

Riot noted that it has placed three purchase orders with MicroBT for additional mining systems. Deployment of the miners is expected to begin in the second quarter and be completed in the third quarter. Riot expects that it will reach a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 41 EH/s in 2025 upon full deployment.

Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In an escalation of tensions between Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), **Patrick McHenry** (R-N.C.), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has openly criticized [SEC Chair **Gary Gensler**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/03/37538468/sec-chair-gary-gensler-declines-to-say-whether-ethereum-is-a-commodity-its-about-circumsta) for his evasive responses during a congressional hearing.

**What Happened**: McHenry [alleged](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1785317163110130028) that Gensler knowingly avoided clarifying whether the SEC considers **Ethereum**‘s ETH/USD cryptocurrency, ether, as a security.

This accusation was spurred by revelations from court documents indicating the SEC was actively investigating ether’s status just before Gensler’s testimony.

“The refusal of Chair Gensler to address questions about the SEC's stance on ether during the hearing appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the agency’s position,” McHenry asserted on social media platform X, referring to evidence presented in a lawsuit filed by blockchain company **Consensys**.

The debate over whether ether should be classified as a security is not just a legal technicality; it carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Should ether be deemed a security, it could set a precedent for the regulation of numerous other digital tokens, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector.

In response to these developments, crypto attorney **Grant Gulovsen** offered a perspective that highlights the complexities of the SEC’s investigative processes.

“The initiation of an investigation by the SEC does not necessarily equate to an official stance or determination,” Gulovsen explained, indicating that the SEC's inquiry into ether does not confirm its classification as a security.

As these events unfold, the discussion around digital assets continues to evolve, emphasizing the [importance of regulatory clarity](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38461470/fbi-issues-warning-against-unregistered-crypto-services-amid-privacy-concerns).

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/anchorage-digital-tokenized-treasury-fund

Markdown Content:
Anchorage Digital is now custodying shares of a tokenized Treasury fund via a partnership with Arca Labs meant to advance institutional participation in the segment. 

The link-up comes as the tokenization of real-world assets is set to continue as a “defining trend” for institutional crypto in 2024, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Blockworks.

The innovation unit of crypto investment firm Arca first issued shares of its US Treasury Fund as digital asset securities, known as ArCoin, in 2021. The company has argued that ArCoin can replace US Treasurys in enterprise workflows while reducing costs and improving transparency.

The company has now turned to [Anchorage](https://blockworks.co/tag/anchorage-digital) — a crypto-focused bank chartered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — to custody the shares.

![Image 1: two men in business suits posing for a photo](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anchorage-Digital-Co-Founders-Nathan-McCauley-and-Diogo-Monica-3.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024)

The alliance allows Anchorage clients to keep ArCoin in custody at the bank. Institutions can now access the tokenized shares from the Anchorage platform as it would for the hundreds of assets the company supports.

McCauley has said Anchorage meets the Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition of a “qualified custodian.” The term was included in the regulator’s February 2023 [proposal](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-30) that would “entrust safekeeping of client assets” to such entities.

“Now that institutions have validated the benefits of blockchain technology, companies are seeking the most secure and seamless digital assets solutions that meet US regulatory standards,” Arca Labs president Jerald David said in a statement.

The Anchorage platform uses hardware security modules, which keeps assets offline in segregated, on-chain vaults while keeping them accessible. The model serves as a “major unlock” for institutional participation in [tokenization](https://blockworks.co/tag/tokenization), McCauley argued.

The world’s largest asset manager, [BlackRock](https://blockworks.co/tag/blackrock), launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in March, marking the firm’s first tokenized offering. 

Fellow fund behemoth Franklin Templeton, which debuted its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021, started allowing institutional investors to transfer shares of the fund — represented by BENJI tokens — to other shareholders last week.

Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, previously told Blockworks that BENJI essentially acts as a stablecoin while also generating income. 

“Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our custody support for tokenization projects to advance institutional participation in the ecosystem for the long term,” McCauley said.

*   The Elliptic2 dataset is orders of magnitude bigger than the one used when the team began using machine learning to detect money laundering with bitcoin back in 2019.

*   The research made use of 122,000 groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions called "subgraphs" with known links to illicit activity.


Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said it detected potential money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin blockchain after training an artificial intelligence (AI) model using a record 200 million transactions.

The work is an extension of a program carried out [back in 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02591) that used a dataset of only 200,000 transactions. The much larger "Elliptic2" dataset made use of 122,000 labeled "subgraphs," groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions known to have links to illicit activity.

AI becomes more insightful the larger the dataset available to train the machine-learning algorithms, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer a plentiful supply of transparent transaction data on the blockchain. Elliptic used the transactions for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity, [Elliptic said in a paper](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai) co-authored with researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.

"The money laundering techniques identified by the model have been identified because they are prevalent in bitcoin," Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an email. "Crypto laundering practices will evolve over time as they cease being effective, but an advantage of an AI/deep learning approach is that new money laundering patterns are identified automatically as they emerge."

Many of the suspicious subgraphs were found to contain what are known as "peeling chains," where a user sends or "peels" cryptocurrency to a destination address, while the remainder is sent to another address under the user's control. This happens repeatedly to form a peeling chain.

"In traditional finance this is known as 'smurfing,' where large amounts of cash are structured into multiple small transactions, to keep them under regulatory reporting limits and avoid detection," Elliptic said in the paper.

Another commonly occurring technique was the use of so-called "nested services," businesses that move funds through accounts at larger cryptocurrency exchanges, sometimes without the awareness or approval of the exchange. A nested service might receive a deposit from one of their customers into a cryptocurrency address, and then forward the funds to their deposit address at an exchange.

"Nested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering - potentially causing them to feature in subgraphs deemed by the model as suspicious," said Elliptic.

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the leading companies, purchased Optimism (OP) tokens worth approximately $90 million.

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capital companies, follows cryptocurrencies closely.

At this point, a16z invested a large amount in an Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin.

According to Unchained, a16z purchased Optimism (OP) tokens worth approximately $90 million.

The news drew attention to the Optimism Foundation's statement in early March that it had sold approximately 19.5 million OPs worth approximately 90 million dollars.

&gt; “Leading venture capital firm a16z has acquired Optimism (OP) for $90 million, according to two sources familiar with the matter.”

One source commented on a16z's latest crypto investment: “Optimisim did pretty well. They're still doing airdrops.” said

While a16z and Optimisim spokesperson did not make a statement regarding the OP investment, an Optimisim spokesperson said, “We are excited about the energy and momentum Optimisim has achieved and are excited for the future.”

Despite the general decline, OP, which increased by 13% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $ 2.64 at the time of writing.

Markdown Content:
Following this week’s [cryptocurrency market](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) crash, digital assets currently display [bearish](https://finbold.com/guide/bear-market-definition/) [technical indicators](https://finbold.com/guide/technical-analysis/#what-is-a-technical-indicator) like a weak [relative strength index](https://finbold.com/guide/rsi-indicator/#h-how-does-the-rsi-indicator-work) (RSI). However, two popular [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) have a potential buy signal, with an extremely oversold status on May 1.

As reported by Finbold, [long-position traders lost $400 million](https://finbold.com/long-position-traders-lost-400-million-in-a-24-hour-bloodbath/) since April 30, as $250 billion in capitalization left the market. The crash impacted Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) and Ethereum ([ETH](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/ethereum/)) traders, mostly, but all cryptocurrencies suffered meaningful losses.

Previously, [crypto traders registered $100 million in total liquidations](https://finbold.com/crypto-traders-lost-100-million-in-4-hours-as-the-market-crashed/) within a 4-hour time frame, which started the major sell-off. As a result, the average RSI dropped to a weak status below 34 index points, suggesting an overall bearish momentum.

### Picks for you

Conversely, while some traders panic sell, others may see a buy signal opportunity for cryptocurrencies with discount prices. In particular, Finbold identified Bitcoin Cash ([BCH](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-cash/)) and Dogecoin ([DOGE](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/)) as the two most oversold cryptocurrencies in _CoinGlass_‘s 4-hour [chart](https://www.coinglass.com/pro/i/RsiHeatMap).

Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Most oversold crypto
----------------------------------------

First, Bitcoin Cash was the most oversold cryptocurrency at press time, with a 21.07 4-hour relative strength index. BCH holds a neutral 52.4 in the weekly time frame despite having a weak 24-hour RSI of 33.37.

As of this writing, the coin trades at $406.2, down 1.41% in the last four hours.

Finbold previously reported two other buy signals for Bitcoin Cash due to [high negative funding rates](https://finbold.com/buy-signal-for-two-cryptocurrencies-with-negative-funding-rates/) and [short-squeeze liquidations](https://finbold.com/short-squeeze-alert-two-cryptocurrencies-with-huge-potential-next-week/). The renowned Bitcoin competitor stood out as an alternative as [BTC fees reached record highs above $100 per transaction](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-fees-above-100-for-the-first-time-sell-off-incoming/).

Buy signal for Dogecoin (DOGE)
------------------------------

Meanwhile, Dogecoin has the second-highest oversold signal among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the 4-hour time frame. DOGE was trading at $0.12 at the time of publication, with a 23.9 RSI.

Like Bitcoin Cash, the leading meme coin has a neutral 50.03 and a weak 31.1 weekly and daily RSI, respectively.

Notably, having an oversold status does not guarantee short-term positive price action and is often seen as a bearish indicator. For now, cryptocurrency investors await a leading signal that could come from macroeconomic decisions from the [Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision](https://finbold.com/investors-adjust-their-bets-on-feds-interest-rate-cut-for-2024/).

Markdown Content:
Social media is evolving towards decentralization, shifting control back to users—a stark contrast to traditional, centralized platforms. This is a welcome change because the decentralization of social media prioritizes user empowerment by restoring control,  offering a stark contrast to the dominance of traditional and centralized social media giants!

[The Dark Side of the Like Button: Decentralized Social Media vs Traditional Social Media](#the-dark-side-of-the-like-button-decentralized-social-media-vs-traditional-social-media)[The Dissatisfaction with Current Revenue Models and the Potential For Fairer Structures in DeSo](#the-dissatisfaction-with-current-revenue-models-and-the-potential-for-fairer-structures-in-deso)[SUPR Tokens and User Governance](#supr-tokens-and-user-governance)[Direct Content Monetization](#direct-content-monetization)[Web2 Social Media Platforms Hoarding Our Data](#web2-social-media-platforms-hoarding-our-data)[Web3 and SocialFi: A New Era of Digital Empowerment](#web3-and-socialfi-a-new-era-of-digital-empowerment)[Transparency and Algorithmic Fairness](#transparency-and-algorithmic-fairness)[Conclusion: Decentralization of Social Media](#conclusion-decentralization-of-social-media)

When talking about traditional social media, it’s not new news that companies like Meta, whose subsidiaries include Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, hold all the power. They control user data, dictate what users see and can even censor content. Remember, if something is free, you are the product.

While we can imagine the societal harm of users chasing dopamine hits in the unending pursuit of likes and comments, these companies are cashing in on our data, which fuels a multi-billion dollar advertising machine.

Decentralization of social media breaks away from corporate-controlled platforms, but what’s the value in that?

**In decentralized social media, user data and content are stored across multiple computers, enhancing security and resistance to censorship**

Just like Neo in The Matrix, decentralized social media offers us a red pill, a chance to wake up, break through the facade of an artificially constructed reality designed to control us, to not only see things for how they truly are but empower us with the tools necessary to set others free by inviting them to join us.

Our current social media experience is like a walled garden–it’s beautiful, and meticulously curated but ultimately restrictive. In this article, we will discuss the shift towards decentralization of social media from traditional social media. We will also take a closer look at platforms like SuperDapp where users have more control, creators are fairly compensated and online interactions are more transparent and user-driven.

Decentralized Social Media (DeSo) clashes dramatically with the traditional social media platforms we are familiar with, offering a new paradigm built on the foundation of user empowerment and data ownership.  But first, we need to see the light in order to break free from the beautiful prisons or walled gardens of centralized social media.

### **The Dissatisfaction with Current Revenue Models and the Potential For Fairer Structures in DeSo**

The creator economy on traditional social media platforms is influenced by factors such as platform design, revenue sharing, and the distribution of creator capabilities. We must recognize the prevalence of questionable compensation structures for the content creators who give people a reason to engage with these sites in the first place. 

For example, Meta is known to take a considerable 30% share while YouTube takes an incredible 45% cut from revenue generated by content creators. Of course, some compensation is better than none, and it could definitely be worse, but is it really _fair_?

One of the key shifts driving the decentralization of social media is the more attractive value proposition made to content creators. After all, thanks to their decentralized nature, there simply isn’t as much overhead needed to pay for things like offices, superfluous departments, or executive bonuses.

This presents an opportunity for decentralized social platforms like SuperDapp to disrupt the status quo, but what is SuperDapp?

SuperDapp is an AI-infused, decentralized SocialFi platform that allows users to interact with others with features like encrypted messaging between individuals and groups, voice and video calls while having their experience enhanced with Web3 features all rolled into a single application. It enhances user experiences with its AI companion, AiDA, which is powered by GPT4. SuperDapp’s integration with Sycoin NEVM and Sycoin Rollux enables it to bridge different blockchain networks so that it brings out a holistic communication environment for users.

&gt; The shift towards decentralized social media marks a pivotal moment in online interaction as it empowers users to take control of their data and experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Jagdeep Sidhu, CEO of SYS Labs.

&gt; [Syscoin collaborated with Polyhedra Network and NodeKit to unveil zkDA (Zero Knowledge Data Availability), which sets a new benchmark in blockchain scalability and security. Read more in this article.](https://droomdroom.com/syscoin-unveils-worlds-first-zkda/)
&gt; 
&gt; ![Image 1: Rollux-Ecosystem](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
&gt; 
&gt; The Rollux ecosystem spans across seven sectors including DeFi, Bridges, Gaming, Tool, Exchanges, NFT and On/Off Ramp

Having discussed the overarching benefits of decentralized platforms like SuperDapp, let’s delve deeper into how they empower users and creators through innovative governance and monetization models.

#### **SUPR Tokens and User Governance**

SuperDapp introduces innovative features that enhance user empowerment and creator revenue. For instance, its revenue-sharing model offers a more equitable distribution compared to traditional platforms like Facebook and YouTube.

While platforms like TikTok and Twitter address basic social needs, their business models don’t prioritize user empowerment or data control. In contrast, decentralized social media platforms like SuperDapp not only provide fairer revenue distribution but also grant users more control over their content and interactions.

SuperDapp’s economy will be supported through the application of its utility token, SUPR. Holding SUPR tokens empowers users, granting them voting rights on platform developments. This empowers users to directly influence revenue generation and distribution, ensuring a user-centric approach, unlike the top-down models of traditional social media.

#### **Direct Content Monetization**

Traditional platforms like YouTube and TikTok have paved the way for content monetization, yet they retain a significant portion of the revenue generated. In contrast, decentralized platforms like SuperDapp allow creators to earn directly from their audiences, bypassing the middlemen and their onerous fees.

SuperDapp takes this a step further by enabling users to directly monetize their content through engagement-based SUPR token rewards within Super Groups. These groups are vibrant communities where content creators and their followers interact, contribute, and grow together, fostering a supportive environment. This system directly links creators’ efforts to their earnings and enhances community engagement, offering a transparent and equitable model that benefits creators and their communities alike. _Learn more about Super Groups from the graphic below_.

![Image 2: Super Groups, a feature that allows users to connect and monetize content.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Super Groups, a feature that allows users to connect and monetize content.

In today’s digital age, data has become as valuable as traditional assets like factories or land. As we pivot to Web3, understanding how it changes data control is crucial.

Under Web 2.0, giants such as Meta and TikTok, claim ownership over the data we generate—our posts, our likes, our digital interactions. This ownership translates into power—the power to leverage our data for advertising, the power to influence and even sell our digital profiles.

[Research by Crypto.com in 2022](https://crypto.com/research/decentralised-social-networks) shows we spend about 2.5 hours daily on social media—a significant portion of our waking lives immersed in a digital space that’s meticulously recording our every click.

![Image 3: daily time spent on social networking by internet users according to crypto.com research.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20939%20613'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Daily time spent on social networking by internet users according to crypto.com research.

But it’s not just about data—it’s also about our voices. Centralized platforms can silence us by censoring content or removing users entirely.

### Web3 and SocialFi: A New Era of Digital Empowerment

Enter Web3 and SocialFi, a merger of social networking with the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi). Here, you reclaim control over your data. Encryption enhances your privacy, shielding your digital activity from prying eyes.

SocialFi isn’t just about data control; it’s about economic participation. You can monetize your social engagement and creative content directly, establishing a more equitable ecosystem for creators.

Platforms like SuperDapp champion this new era with end-to-end encryption for all communications, ensuring that conversations remain between the intended parties alone. SuperDapp also anonymizes user data, making personal information and metadata indecipherable to anyone but the user.

Moreover, the decentralized and censorship-resistant fabric of SuperDapp ensures that no single entity can control or censor user data, preserving the freedom of expression. This independence from central control is not just a feature; it’s the foundation of a platform where users truly own their digital existence.

### **Transparency and Algorithmic Fairness**

The transition to Web3 social media is reshaping the digital landscape into a collaborative environment. Here, creators, users, and the platform work in tandem fostering a scenario where everyone wins. Web3 redefines the social media framework, ushering in a new age of openness and fair market practices for algorithms and app features.

SuperDapp, at the forefront of this change, champions AI-powered SocialFi, ensuring a transparent approach to content ranking and rewards. Gone are the days of opaque algorithms—SuperDapp’s transparency gives everyone an insight into what content gains traction and why.

SuperDapp shares a recent update to the AI app including improvements to performance, user experience, automation, contacts, and the signup flow.

Powered by blockchain and smart contracts, AiDA, SuperDapp’s AI companion, dynamically adapts based on user interactions, refining the platform to cater to individual preferences. This not only heightens user satisfaction but also encourages a tailored experience for each user.

&gt; [SuperDapp’s AiDA provides a personalized approach to enhance user experience. Read more about it in this extensive article by DroomDroom.](https://droomdroom.com/role-of-ai-in-enhancing-web3-user-experiences/)

Furthermore, SuperDapp rewards developers directly through its innovative monetization strategy for AI plugins. As users engage with AI features, developers reap the benefits, all enabled by SuperDapp’s flexible payment system, which supports subscription models seamlessly.

Our journey through the emerging world of decentralized social media illuminates a path of autonomy and fairness, with SuperDapp leading the charge. It’s clear that platforms like SuperDapp aren’t just altering the digital landscape; they are setting new standards for creator compensation, user agency, and data stewardship.

SuperDapp transcends the limitations of traditional platforms by offering a user-driven ecosystem where the value generated is shared equitably, bolstering both creator sustainability and community engagement. The privacy, security, and transparency ingrained in decentralized systems are not just features—they’re foundational pillars that reshape our online interactions and content consumption.

As we close this discussion, it’s evident that the shift towards platforms like SuperDapp represents more than an evolution in social media—it heralds a renaissance of digital empowerment and connection, unshackled from the constraints of centralized control. In this new era, every like, share, and interaction is a step towards a more inclusive, secure, and user-centric online world.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price trajectory has fueled speculation and uncertainty, particularly as the cryptocurrency struggles amidst a three-day losing streak. Currently hovering around $57,280, with an intraday low of $56,750, [Bitcoin’s performance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) in the market remains lackluster.

This decline coincides with broader market movements, with the global crypto market cap slumping by 6.4%, standing at $2.22 trillion presently. Investors are closely eyeing the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision, reflecting apprehension about its potential impact on cryptocurrency investments.

Bitcoin Price Drops Pre-FOMC Meeting Amid USD Strength
------------------------------------------------------


[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-passes-the-63000-mark-once-more-time-to-buy.htm)‘s price has declined over the last three days ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with investors bracing for a potentially hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) stance. The Federal Reserve’s policy committee is expected to affirm a cautious and gradual strategy towards reducing interest rates in 2024. However, greater focus may be placed on the Fed’s plans regarding its balance sheet.

The CME FedWatch Tool indicates a mere 4.4% chance of a rate cut, with 95.6% anticipating rates to remain steady between 525 and 550 basis points.  The Federal Open Market Committee will wrap up its two-day April policy meeting today and announce its decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will then speak at a press conference starting at 2:30 p.m. Futures markets have largely priced in the likelihood of no adjustment to interest rates during this meeting.

*   [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=As%20more%20and%20more%20people,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.), now trading around $56,500, has plunged over 7% in 24 hours amid renewed economic uncertainty.
*   Investor sentiment leans towards the Fed refraining from rate cuts this year, adversely affecting assets like cryptocurrencies.
*   The US dollar has strengthened on upbeat Employment Cost Index data and Fed officials’ remarks signalling no immediate rate cut necessity, exacerbating pressure on BTC prices and the crypto market overall.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
------------------------

[Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) (BTC/USD) encountered a substantial decline. It is now priced at $57,332, reflecting a 6.4% downturn. The pivotal price levels and indicators are essential to the technical landscape. At present, the pivot point rests at $59,008, with immediate resistance observed at $61,569, followed by subsequent hurdles at $64,654 and $67,084.

Noteworthy indicators include an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 25, signalling a potential reversal, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50 EMA) positioned at $63,473, potentially acting as resistance.

Below the pivotal level of $59,008, the outlook remains bearish, with a breakthrough indicating a shift towards a more bullish sentiment, while a failure may reinforce the prevailing bearish bias. Traders should closely monitor these levels for strategic decision-making.

![Image 1: Bitmart Confirms it Will List Mollars ($MOLLARS) token](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/01130339/1714568618-mollars-tokens-x.jpg)

Mollars token presale has had an exhilarating 2024, becoming the top  verifiable cryptocurrency initial coin offering. Transparent with their ICO wallet addresses, every bit of the 1.2-million-dollars raised thus far is able to be verified by investors as it [surpasses 67% sold out](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ethereum-blockchain-s-mollars-token-pre-sale-achieves-65-sold-out/ar-AA1nMjNB?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds).   Now, the store of value token for Ethereum Blockchain has extended the presale,  allowing Bitmart crypto exchange the time to confirm its launch on their CEX.

“#BitMart is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Mollars token (MOLLARS) @mollarstoken” wrote the popular crypto exchange on X \[fka twitter\]. 9-Million Crypto Traders Confirmed To Get Access to Mollars ----------------------------------------------------------- The prominent cryptocurrency exchange has over 9-million users internationally and is the first to confirm that Mollars token will launch. With just a total token supply of just 10-million, perhaps the one exchange would be enough to exhaust all whole $MOLLARS tokens. [![Image 2](https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/27143252/1714228372-mollars-banner.gif)](http://www.mollars.com/)

Regardless, it’s not the only exchange set to list Mollars. According to [an official reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mollarstoken/comments/1cha2w4/bitmart_has_agreed_to_list_mollars_token_listing/), multiple exchanges have already confirmed they will list the new Bitcoin rival.   Due to the policy of CEXES however, the names cannot be released before the token has launched.

The listings come with a slight price however;  Mollars token has had to push back their launch date to the end of the month, May 31st.  

Reason for ICO Extension
------------------------


The pullback will allow crypt investors more time to invest in the new cryptocurrency during its initial coin offering stage but also help ensure the liquidity pool is $1-million-dollars or as close to it as possible.

This token presale has a hard cap of $2-million-dollars, which will be distributed between liquidity pool and brand development according to the tokenomics report \[via Mollars.com\]. Crypto News Youtube show host, ‘_Ari_,’ did a review on the Mollars tokenomics calling the structure legitimate and showing potential for an ‘explosive’ token growth; possibly a 20x in ROI yields for ICO investors.. Other reasons cited for the extension include the loss of 45 days during the ICO. Earlier, domain registry shell company “NJAL.LA,” which is owned by one of the cofounders of SilkRoad, attempted to hijack Mollars.com. The action was quickly reversed after CryptoNews.com put out [a report on the situation](https://cryptonews.com/news/domain-registry-company-finesses-new-bitcoin-rival-out-of-their-com.htm), including names of parties involved. 

Before the situation, Mollars token presale was averaging around 90,000 token sales per day.   It tools nearly 1.5 months for the ICO to reach similar averages.

Today, Mollars initial coin offering is back to its normal pre-sales totals.   Crypto investors bought nearly $28,000 \[9.3ETH\] of $MOLLARS tokens in the last 24 hours alone. If the these stats continue, excluding weekends, Mollars should raise over $650,000 between now and the May 31st deadline; Enough to put the ICO very close to hard cap. This would help solidify the store-of-value token’s liquidity pool and maximize the token’s price potential on listing day.

The well-known American magazine Forbes described 20 altcoins as zombies, including XRP, Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

Forbes, a well-known American magazine with a history of more than 100 years, recently published a striking report.

Although Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins are becoming more used and adopted day by day, Forbes described some blockchains and altcoins as “zombies”.

Mentioning 20 altcoins, Forbes also included popular altcoins such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classis (ETC).

According to Forbes, these altcoins do not meet traditional measures of success, exhibiting minimal utility and user adoption.

It was stated that the common feature of these altcoins is that they do not have any practical denominator and a significant user base. Forbes argues that all of these altcoins have a speculative structure.

These altcoins were listed as follows: XRP, ADA, LTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Internet Computer (ICP), ETC, Stellar (XLM), Stacks (STX), Kaspa (KAS), Theta (THETA), Phantom (FTM) , Monero (XMR), Arweave (AR), Algorand (ALGO), Flow (FLOW), MultiversX (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Mina (MINA), Tezos (XTZ) and Eos (EOS).

[Shiba Inu](https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium) is currently one step away from a potential catastrophe, as it faces potential selling pressure that could theoretically push it below $0.00001. The asset has recently landed on a strong support level at $0.000021, as indicated by the blue line on the chart. This level is crucial for Shiba Inu’s short-term stability, and any breach below could intensify selling pressure.

Currently, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average is playing a pivotal role in providing support to the price. This technical indicator often acts as a psychological barrier for traders and can either bolster buying confidence or, if broken, lead to increased selling. If [Shiba Inu's](https://u.today/billions-of-shiba-inu-shib-by-coinbase-in-24-hours-whats-happening) price falls below this EMA, it will encounter the next major [support](https://u.today/peter-brandt-predicts-bitcoin-bull-run-till-2025-shiba-inu-team-gives-crucial-statement-on) at the 200-day EMA.

![Image 2: SHIBUSDT](https://u.today/sites/default/files/inline-images/image_740.png)

[SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)

Unfortunately, if the price breaks down below the 200-day EMA, the next significant level of support is notably lower, below $0.00001. Such a move would practically negate the uptrend Shiba Inu has enjoyed throughout 2024, possibly resetting market expectations and investor sentiment around the asset.

In terms of resistance, [Shiba Inu](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-outshines-doge-and-pepe-in-this-key-metric) faces immediate barriers at $0.0000228 and $0.0000245. These levels represent short-term goals for the asset to reclaim to sustain its bullish momentum. Overcoming these could push the asset back into bullish territory and rekindle investor interest, potentially leading to a price surge. It would also mark the recovery of the cryptocurrency market in general.

Looking ahead, the future of Shiba Inu is tied to its ability to maintain above these critical support levels. A sustained breakdown below $0.000021 could trigger a cascade of selling, weakening recent gains and aggravating the sentiment surrounding the meme coin.

URL Source: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T09:00:37-05:00

Markdown Content:
In a statement on X that counters the prevailing wisdom among crypto enthusiasts, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently expressed reservations about the reliance on [hardware wallets](https://bitcoinist.com/why-you-need-a-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/) for securing digital assets.  
Buterin’s commentary emerged during a broader conversation on crypto security, which featured insights from several leading figures from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Why The Ethereum Founder Doesn’t Use Hardware Wallets
-----------------------------------------------------

The debate illuminated the complexities of digital asset security and showcased a range of opinions on how best to protect these assets. Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, [pointed out](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) the inherent risks associated with hardware wallets. He emphasized the potential personal errors that can undermine the security of such devices.

[![Image 1: a banner with the words'bitstarz' and an image of a woman in a red dress](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=844202)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=1983102&amp;setID=367529&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=727083&amp;banID=520891527&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=1911064&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574255857788&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=b5146410b385bd7f90c11f7bd4fe609db836e118&amp;location=)

“Counterpoint: when using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself. Beware of the footguns: Someone finds your stashed seed, You hide the seed so well you forget, You put the seed in a bank safety deposit then hastily move overseas due to covid,” Watts commented, reflecting a critical vulnerability — human error, which can lead to significant security breaches even with robust technological safeguards.

Responding to these concerns, Buterin [elaborated](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) on his personal approach to crypto security. He stated, “The above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for &gt;90% of my personal funds. M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.”

Buterin’s approach involves a [multisig configuration](https://bitcoinist.com/poly-network-hacker-returns-stolen-funds-after-requesting-a-multisig-wallet/), which requires multiple keys to authorize transactions, thereby dispersing the risk and reducing the chances of theft or loss due to a single point of failure.

[![Image 2: bbc iPlayer - screenshot](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4141110)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2392606&amp;setID=476001&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=878423&amp;banID=521869883&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2311166&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574255858710&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=e277bddf5d2cdfa84c753a8571d793718d19c601&amp;location=)

During the discussion, tobbykitty.eth proposed an alternative method known as Shamir’s Secret Sharing, a cryptographic scheme that divides a secret into multiple parts. He argued for its benefits in eliminating the need to trust others during the recovery phase, asserting that this method allows full control over the cryptographic keys without involving others.

However, Buterin countered this suggestion, pointing out the practical difficulties associated with implementing Shamir’s Secret Sharing correctly, noting, “It’s way easier to screw up than a multisig.” He also cautioned about the practical use of Shamir’s method.

[![Image 3: a screen shot of a purple and blue background](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4112488)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=172179&amp;plid=2368622&amp;setID=476002&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=697928&amp;banID=521829420&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2287404&amp;adSize=728x90&amp;mt=1714574256017489&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Fethereum-buterin-warns-hardware-wallet-use%2F&amp;hc=7bcc416476e7ac0bf824a7dbe48c782426347c00&amp;location=)

“It depends who’s storing the shamir shares! I think the questions (i) ‘trust your other devices’ vs ‘trust your friends’ (ii) shamir vs multisig are orthogonal,” Buterin concluded. Thus, he underscored the complexity and potential for user error inherent in implementing Shamir’s method effectively.

The starting point of the debate was a post by Kofi, associated with gasfees.io. He provided a real-world perspective on the importance of using hardware wallets despite their potential drawbacks. He vividly described the emotional and financial impact of losing significant crypto holdings and advocated for the use of hardware wallets as a fundamental component of a comprehensive security strategy.

He said, “Buy a hardware wallet today and start using it ASAP. Send a little ETH to your hardware wallet from your hot wallet ([Metamask](https://bitcoinist.com/defi-bull-indicator-metamask-over-30-million/), Phantom, Rainbow .etc). Then move the majority of your funds to your hardware wallet, everything you won’t critically need for the next few days. Store the wallet somewhere safe.”

Kofi’s advice reflects a pragmatic approach to crypto security, emphasizing the importance of protecting against online threats. However, he later also acknowledged in response to the Ethereum founder that investors with a large portion of their net worth in cryptocurrencies should consider using a multisig wallet. “With a multisig, multiple keys (can be a combination of hardware and hot wallets) are needed to sign any transaction,” he added.

At press time, the Ethereum price was at $2,916.

*   _Ethereum has dropped below the $3,000 price range._
*   _ETH supply in profit dropped by around five million._

The [Ethereum \[ETH\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/) market witnessed a substantial price downturn as trading activity concluded on the 30th of April. This decline had notable repercussions on several key metrics associated with the asset.

#### **Ethereum falls 6%**

AMBCrypto’s analysis of [Ethereum](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-3360-rejection-how-much-is-profit-taking-to-blame/) revealed a negative conclusion to April, marked by a significant price drop.

On the 30th of April, ETH experienced a decline of 6.29%, trading at approximately $3,013, just managing to hold onto the $3,000 price level.

However, as of the latest update, the decline persisted, pushing Ethereum below the $3,000 threshold. Its price was around $2,972 at press time. 

[![Image 2: Ethereum price trend](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201793%20689'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ETHUSD_2024-05-01_07-44-39.png)

Initially, Ethereum seemed poised to breach its short-term moving average (yellow line), which acted as resistance in the $3,300 to $3,500 range.

However, the recent downturn has pushed it further away from this target, and forced Ethereum to cross another significant threshold on its Relative Strength Index (RSI).

At press time, ETH dipped below 40 on the RSI, signaling a strong bearish trend.

#### **Longs feel the heat of the dip**

AMBCrypto’s analysis of [Ethereum’s](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-returns-to-bear-trend-amidst-whale-induced-sell-offs/) liquidation chart on [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/ETH) revealed a notable surge in liquidation volume on the 30th of April.

The king of altcoins witnessed its highest liquidation volume in weeks, totaling over $115 million by the end of trading that day.

Further examination of the chart highlighted that long positions bore the brunt of the liquidation, accounting for approximately $97.4 million. In comparison, short positions contributed $18.11 million to the total.

This spike in long liquidation marked the most significant volume seen in weeks, signifying that traders who had taken long positions or anticipated an increase in Ethereum’s price had their positions forcibly closed.

#### **Possible reasons for the Ethereum decline**

There has been discussion surrounding the Hong Kong ETFs launched on the 30th of April, with some observers [expressing disappointment](https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1785283289558765653) in their performance, citing low volume.

Figures indicated a total volume of around $12.7 million, with Bitcoin comprising over $9.7 million and Ethereum over $3 million. 

However, [contrasting views](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1785330193315373352) suggest that the volume was decent and not a failure, as suggested by other observers. The sluggish start contributed to the negative movement in Ethereum’s price. 

Additionally, concerns about the Federal Reserve potentially maintaining its hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on the 1st of May may have fueled the decline.

With no expectations of a rate cut due to persistent inflation in the US economy, the crypto market has historically exhibited declines leading up to FOMC meetings as investors exercise caution in anticipation of policy shifts.

#### **Ethereum supply in profit declines**

[Ethereum’s](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-to-outshine-btc-this-summer-raoul-pals-bold-prediction/) supply in profit revealed a sharp decline. Per AMBCrypto’s analysis via Santiment, between the 28th and the 30th of April, ETH’s supply in profit dropped from over 87% to approximately 83%.

This shift indicated a decrease in volume from over 119 million to around 114 million ETH. It suggested that more holders were increasingly retaining their ETH assets at a loss as the price continued to decline.

Yuga Labs CEO [Greg Solano](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/greg-solano) faced a challenging day, as he conveyed to company employees in a message subsequently shared with the public.

Following an all-hands meeting where layoffs were disclosed, some staff members experienced an even tougher time. Solano attributed Yuga’s struggles to losing its original direction.

CoinFund's Ginns on Crypto, Real Yields Correlation

In his internal communication, Solano reflected on his two-month tenure as CEO, lamenting the erosion of the company’s creative ethos:

“The creative-first spirit that drove this company from inception has been getting muddied by labyrinthine corporate processes.

“We work hard and we care but somehow end up with groups and committees.

“We plan more than we ship.”  
“Creator royalties were thriving and made our whole ecosystem electric. Now we’re in hard mode,” Solano said, but he has a plan.

Solano outlined initial steps in the restructuring, citing the spinout of HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara on April 17.

Yuga’s gaming properties were acquired by game developer Faraway, with Yuga’s chief gaming officer Spencer Tucker joining them.

Solano’s message on April 26 emphasized Yuga’s focus on developing its Otherside metaverse project.

Shortly before Solano’s announcement, Won Kim was appointed as Yuga’s head of brand partnerships. Kim, co-founder of the Bored Room Ventures NFT fund and consulting agency, left his previous position for Yuga.

The X crypto community had mixed reactions to the layoffs, though Solano’s post garnered overwhelming support.

Amidst supportive responses, there were also dissenting voices. One individual, Ricefarmer, claimed to have been laid off from Yuga Labs and highlighted their former role as a Discord moderator.

Yuga Labs, known for pioneering NFT collectibles, has faced challenges amid market evolution. In October, the company underwent restructuring, which included a round of layoffs.

When approached for further comment, Yuga Labs declined to provide additional information.

The firm's head of digital assets research links Bitcoin's downturn to US inflation and ETF outflows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stubborn inflation, the unlikelihood of near-term rate cuts, and cooling demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – all of these factors could prolong Bitcoin’s price correction to $50,000, according to Standard Chartered.

&gt; “BTC’s proper break below $60K has now reopened a route to the $50-52K range,” Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered [told](https://www.theblock.co/post/291908/standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-fall-50000) The Block, adding that the downward trend is attributed to a mix of crypto-specific factors and broader economic conditions.

Bitcoin’s ongoing price decline coincides with a series of outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the lukewarm reception of similar products in Hong Kong.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

Kendrick points out that liquidity measures in the US have deteriorated, which negatively affects assets like cryptos that typically benefit from high liquidity environments.

The backdrop of strong US inflation and the reduced likelihood of Fed rate cuts are further contributing to tightening liquidity, impacting investment flows into riskier assets like Bitcoin, he noted.

[Bitcoin wobbles ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-fed-rate-impact/). Yesterday, Bitcoin’s price plunged as low as $59,500 and [extended its correction to $57,000](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-prices-drop-fed-meeting/) earlier this morning in the lead-up to the Fed’s key decision.

Kendrick suggests that a potential re-entry into Bitcoin could be considered in the $50,000 to $52,000 range, especially if upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data proves to be favorable, potentially easing some macroeconomic pressures.

&gt; “Of course, liquidity matters when it matters, but with a backdrop of strong U.S. inflation data and less likelihood of Fed rate cuts, it matters at the moment,” he explained. “Re-enter BTC in the $50-52k range or if US CPI on the 15th is friendly.”

Standard Chartered doubles down on its $150,000 price target by year-end
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kendrick stated in an interview with Bloomberg BNN last month that [Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by the end of this year](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-price-forecast-standard-chartered/) and rise to $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Despite the current market dynamics, he reaffirmed these price targets for 2024 and 2025. The analyst told The Block that while progress might be slow at first, a significant rally could be expected closer to the anticipated Trump election victory, particularly from September through to the end of the year.

[Ross Ulbricht](https://u.today/silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-turns-40-with-11-years-spent-behind-bars) is the founder of the ill-famed darkweb marketplace The Silk Road shut down in 2013 after running for two years under Ulbricht’s leadership. Having spent more than a decade in prison already, he has tweeted that now, the US authorities may deprive him of the connection to the crypto community – social media presence.

Ulbricht announced that he may be deprived on his voice on social media soon. According to his tweet, the Bureau of Prisons is considering preventing prisoners from using any social media in the future even those who have accounts run by their close relatives.

The founder of The Silk Road confessed that he is afraid of being unable to write into the X platform any more to share his life with the crypto community. Thus, he fears he may be silenced in prison until the end of his life.

&gt; I may lose my voice soon. I found out the Bureau of Prisons is thinking of preventing prisoners from having any social media presence (even those who have an account entirely run by a loved one, like mine).
&gt; 
&gt; I’m scared I won’t be able to share my life with you anymore.

The cryptocurrency community has expressed their concerns and support to Ulbricht over this development.

Ulbricht has recently celebrated his 40th birthday after having spent 11 years behind bars. He was given two life-time sentences without a change of parole.

He often uses his X account to share the details of his life inside prison with his followers and well-wishers.

Earlier this year, former “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver emphasized the [importance of Ulbricht](https://u.today/roger-ver-issues-crucial-ross-ulbricht-bitcoin-btc-x-post) and The Silk Road for early Bitcoin adoption – all the illegal trade, a lot of which was about trading illicit drugs, was powered by BTC as new form of money not controlled by the US government.

As reported by U.Today, Roger Ver was arrested in Spain yesterday on charges of tax evasion in the US. He is now awaiting to be extradited to the US.

URL Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-l2-runes-btc-network

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:55:18.000Z

Markdown Content:
The need for Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) solutions has become more apparent than ever following the [launch of the Runes protocol](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/runes-supporters-unlock-bitcoins-potential/). 

Runes are a new Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) token standard allowing users to create fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. They were created by Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, which [enabled Bitcoin nonfungible tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals).

While notable, Runes’ popularity has [resulted in astronomical Bitcoin transaction fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miners-reap-bitcoin-runes-fees) and unprecedented network congestion.

A Dune Analytics [dashboard](https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/runes) shows that millions of Runes transactions have been processed, [accounting for 68% of all Bitcoin transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-runes-make-up-68-of-all-transactions-since-launch) made since the protocol launched.

According to [research](https://assets.bitcoinlayersreport.com/Bitcoin%20Layers%20Report_%20Tapestry%20of%20a%20Trustless%20Financial%20Era%20-%20Dec%202023%20Edition.pdf) from blockchain asset management firm Spartan Group, the introduction of Ordinals resulted in Bitcoin fees increasing as much as 280% year-to-date by December 2023.

The report notes that this marked heightened activity on the Bitcoin network, reflecting demand for Bitcoin [L2 scaling solutions](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions).

Rena Shah, vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, told Cointelegraph, “641,668 Bitcoin transactions occurred on Bitcoin because users wanted to etch Runes and make their BTC productive. Transaction bloat is the canary for Bitcoin builders in the coal mine. It’s time for L2s to scale in the direction users are going.”

Shah believes that a “Bitcoin L2 summer” is unfolding, which will result in an influx of scaling solutions.

“Similarly, when Ethereum transaction fees became unbearable for daily use, the community quickly embraced L2s,” she added.

**_Recent: [Changpeng Zhao four-month prison sentence lighter than expected](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-sentence-binance)_**

Daniel Fogg, CEO of Rootstock Labs, told Cointelegraph that while Bitcoin can handle Runes’ increased activity, the main chain fees present an opportunity for L2s that can successfully scale the network and expand its functionality.

“Runes (like Ordinals and inscriptions) have brought excitement back to the idea of building on Bitcoin. But if you are going to build a new economy, storing and transferring value are not enough. You need Turing-complete smart contracts, developer tools and much more,” he added.

Bitcoin L2s in development
--------------------------

Given these needs, a number of Bitcoin L2 solutions are coming to fruition.

For example, Fogg said that Rootstock is a Bitcoin L2 solution that combines the security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum.

Rootstock falls into Spartan Group’s “Big Four” category for emerging Bitcoin L2 solutions. According to Spartan Group’s Bitcoin Layers Report, Rootstock brought [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-an-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-and-how-does-it-work)\-compatible smart contracts to Bitcoin through its RSK Virtual Machine, known as RVM. The report notes, “With RVM, developers can port Ethereum contracts on top of Bitcoin.”

Fogg noted that Rootstock is one of the longest-running Bitcoin sidechains, with over $460 million [bridged](https://defillama.com/bridged) in total value locked.

“Over 60% of the hashing power of Bitcoin secures Rootstock through its unique merged mined consensus mechanism. Even Bitcoin’s latest halving block contained a Rootstock tag,” Fogg remarked.

The Stacks network, which launched in January 2021, is another well-known Bitcoin L2. The Stacks Bitcoin L2 uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism that runs parallel to and reuses the computational power of [Bitcoin’s proof-of-work](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained) consensus.

Shah said that while Stacks has been in development for years, the network will soon receive a major upgrade that will finally make it a usable Bitcoin L2.

She said, “The Stacks Nakamoto is a major upcoming upgrade for the Stacks layer, making it faster and more secure.”

Specifically speaking, Shah explained that the upgrade will create faster block times, Bitcoin finality and [miner extractable value](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-mev-ethereums-invisible-tax) upgrades.

“With these changes, Stacks is moving into a true, usable L2 category that unlocks BTC capital from the layer-1 for use in L2 apps. Think DeFi \[decentralized finance\], Web3 identities, real-world assets and more. $1 trillion in BTC capital can finally shift from a passive asset to a productive asset,” said Shah. More Bitcoin L2s underway ------------------------- While Rootstack and Stacks are some of the longest-standing Bitcoin L2s, Fogg believes that [more solutions are on the horizon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-layer-2s-among-catalysts-bull-cycle-bitcoin-og-says).

Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cointelegraph that he estimates at least 40 Bitcoin L2s have recently been announced.

“I’ve been following this space closely and have come across a few websites that list emerging Bitcoin L2s,” said Zamyatin.

Zamyatin added that BOB — a hybrid L2 solution — will launch its mainnet on May 1.

“BOB combines Bitcoin features with the innovation capabilities of Ethereum like EVM, smart contracts and self-custody Web3 wallets,” he said.

Bitcoin L2s create more use cases
---------------------------------

While these innovations will likely positively impact the Bitcoin network, it’s important to understand their impact on Runes.

Knut Arne Vinger, chief technology officer and co-founder of Coinweb Labs, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin L2 solutions can extend Runes’ functionality, making them more composable with other Bitcoin data. This is important, as it’s been noted that Runes are currently [akin to memecoins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-opportunity-bitcoin-runes-after-first-wave-investor-hype) with little, if any, utility.

Yet Vinger explained that a Coinweb reactive smart contract can be used to monitor transactions involving Runes to add mechanisms such as collateralization and other incentive mechanisms to extend use cases.

“Coinweb is about to activate its unifying L2 computation layer on top of Bitcoin, which will allow users to run smart contracts on Bitcoin using their existing Bitcoin wallets. We believe that this, combined with mechanisms for settlement in native Bitcoin, will be a game changer,” he said.

**_Recent: [Q-Day approaching: Can Ethereum survive a quantum emergency?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-quantum-emergency-cryptography)_**

Fogg added that other Bitcoin L2 solutions are focused on creating [stronger, safer bridges to Bitcoin using BitVM](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bitvm-whitepaper-computation-smart-contracts). ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus announced BitVM in a white paper titled “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” on Oct. 9, 2023. BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin’s consensus rules.

“This opens up the possibility of developing optimistic rollups connected to Bitcoin,” said Fogg. “Most of the L2s that have published white papers or launched testnets in recent months are doing some variant of this.”

However, Fogg warned that many Bitcoin L2 solutions being developed today may just be for hype.

“Rootstock’s view is that in order to be considered a Bitcoin L2, the blockchain must use BTC as its native asset, use Bitcoin as a settlement mechanism to enforce transactions and demonstrate a functional dependence on Bitcoin. Everything else is just affinity marketing,” he remarked.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/tokenized-real-world-assets-nears-8-billion-in-value-as-demand-grows/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:53:22+00:00

Markdown Content:
The total value locked (TVL) in Real-World Assets ([RWA](https://finbold.com/guide/real-world-asset-tokenization-vs-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network/)) has seen explosive growth over the last year, with the TVL surging to $8 billion.

The Real-World Assets sector has experienced substantial growth over the past year, with new protocols emerging that broaden the range of tokenizable assets. This expansion has propelled the TVL from approximately $2 billion at the start of 2023 to nearly $8 billion.

According to a detailed [analysis](https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1785448731803807800) by _Messari_ released in May, [stablecoins](https://finbold.com/guide/stablecoins/) like [USDC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/) and [USDT](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/tether/) have dominated asset tokenization, representing the bulk of on-chain tokenized assets. 

### Picks for you

However, the landscape began to shift significantly over the past year with the advent of protocols aimed at broadening the spectrum of tokenized assets. This expansion has been pivotal in increasing the TVL to almost $8 billion now.

Real-world assets growth and demand
-----------------------------------

RWA protocols offer exposure either to off-chain interest rates or to the price movements of non-interest-bearing assets. They are further categorized by the nature of the investment—either as debt or equity—each carrying distinct risk and return profiles. The clear trend is toward protocols that provide stable and high returns, with debt instruments particularly favored due to their lower volatility and straightforward yield generation.

The decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://finbold.com/guide/liquidity-mining-definition/)) analytics platform [_DeFiLlama_](https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA) supports these findings but reports a slightly lower TVL of $6 billion. Despite the discrepancy, both sources underscore a monumental 700% growth in protocol TVL since the beginning of 2023, painting a picture of rapidly increasing market interest and investment in these types of assets.

Not only has the total value locked seen impressive growth, but the number of active users on RWA protocols has also risen markedly since February, signaling a boost in popularity among smaller retail investors, according to _Dune Analytics_. Protocols like the digital carbon market platforms Toucan and KlimaDAO, and the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced significant user growth.

One of the key growth areas within RWA protocols is the focus on yield-bearing assets, designed to bridge the gap between off-chain yields and on-chain users. The divergence between on-chain and off-chain yields, especially noticeable during periods of rising interest rates, has renewed interest in these tokenization models.

Protocols like MakerDAO, which uses U.S. Treasury bills as collateral for its [DAI](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/dai/) stablecoin, and others such as Ondo and Mountain Protocol, are significant contributors to this segment. These platforms have helped stabilize the yield-bearing stablecoin market, despite it being a smaller part of the RWA ecosystem with just over $1 billion in TVL.

Consumer trends and investments
-------------------------------

Despite the diverse offerings within the RWA market, consumer trends show a pronounced preference for yield-bearing assets, which now account for over 90% of the sector’s TVL. This preference is further highlighted by the minimal market traction of non-yield-bearing assets like tokenized [gold](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-gold-with-a-credit-card/) and real estate, suggesting that the market is skewed towards investments that offer direct returns.

The world’s largest tokenized treasury fund, [BlackRock’s Ethereum-based Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund](https://finbold.com/is-blackrock-investing-in-rwa-tokens-heres-what-we-know/) (BUIDL), and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) have made significant contributions to the RWA sector’s expansion. These funds have not only attracted substantial capital but have also set new standards for integrating traditional financial assets with blockchain [technology](https://finbold.com/category/technology-news/).

As the landscape for tokenized real-world assets continues to mature, the sector’s growth trajectory suggests a strong market shift towards assets that offer tangible yields. This shift is largely driven by the blockchain community’s preference for investments that merge traditional financial stability with the innovative potential of digital assets. 

With nearly $8 billion in TVL and rising user engagement, the future of RWA protocols looks promising as they bridge the gap between conventional asset markets and the digital [finance](https://finbold.com/category/finance-news/) realm.

The token for storage coin project Arweave (AR) has shed 18.7% overnight, taking some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide crash that has dragged market leader [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/)‘s (BTC) price down by 7%.

Arweave currently trades at a price of $27.76, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave). Given the fact it is currently posting 7-day losses of 18.1%, it’s clear the crash only began in the last 24 hours.

According to the token’s trading chart, a major sell-off occurred overnight. AR’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 27 with the potential to fall further. RSI is a metric analyzing whether a token is priced well or not based on current buying and selling momentum.

An RSI below 30 is oversold, so it looks like tempestuous waters for the rest of the day. For some, this may be a perfect dip-buying opportunity, but as with any investment, investors should research prudently.

Arweave’s AR is currently trading about $4 south of its 30-day moving average, represented by the blue line. This further underscores the token’s extreme volatility right now.

Although AR is not a blockchain-based token, the Arweave protocol taps a distributed ledger system (DLS) to store data across multiple nodes.

The primary function of Arweave is to be a decentralized data storage solution, matching users who need data storage with those who have a surplus of it to give away.

It’s competitor, [Filecoin](https://cryptonews.com/news/is-filecoin-going-to-zero-fil-price-dips-4-as-new-bitcoin-platform-hits-7-2-million.htm) (FIL), posted lighter overnight losses of around 6% and currently changes hand at $5.33. 

Cryptocurrencies everywhere are tumbling. Bitcoin’s heavy intraday losses put it now at around $57,500, far south of the $60k psychological support level and some 22% down from an all-time high of $73,737.94, posted on March 14 this year. 

Investors Stack Mega Dice While Funds Exit Arweave.
---------------------------------------------------


Projects like Arweave and Filecoin both underscore the premise that crypto has a lot more to offer the world beyond payments and a store of value.

Today’s market crash may have briefly dimmed their shine, but the world hasn’t seen the last of utility tokens. As developers get more comfortable with the technology, crypto will likely be utilized in ways we can’t imagine yet.

GambleFi is one sector that’s getting more of a look-in nowadays. That’s because it’s a crypto-native Web3 version of online gambling.

According to [data compiled by Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/online-gambling/worldwide), revenue in the sector market is projected to climb to $100.90 billion this year.

That means investors wanting a head start on Web3’s newest innovations early are more likely to find heady upside potential in tokens attached to crypto-integrated iGaming platforms, like Mega Dice.

**TL;DR**

*   The cryptocurrency market has recently suffered heavy losses, with major assets experiencing significant declines.
*   Despite the downturn, there is one meme coin that saw a dramatic increase, surging 800% in a week after being launched on PancakeSwap and receiving backing from Crypto.com.

[![Image 1](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_634+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CAW_CB.jpg)](https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CAW_CB.jpg)

The cryptocurrency sector recently [erased](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lost-over-200b-as-btc-dumps-to-57k-ahead-of-fomc-meeting-market-watch/) much of the gains recorded in the last few months, with its global market capitalization plunging to as low as $2.2 billion. The leading digital assets – Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and many more – are deep in the red on a 7-day scale.

The bloodbath in the meme coin is even more severe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 22% weekly, while dogwifhat (WIF) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have lost nearly 30% of their valuations for the same period. 

However, one asset of that type stands well in the green amid the grim reality, and its name is Crow With Knife (CAW).

[![Image 2](https://servedbyadbutler.com/getad.img/;libID=4092929)](https://servedbyadbutler.com/redirect.spark?MID=183000&amp;plid=2349124&amp;setID=631314&amp;channelID=0&amp;CID=863584&amp;banID=521782170&amp;PID=0&amp;textadID=0&amp;tc=1&amp;scheduleID=2268194&amp;adSize=300x250&amp;mt=1714574497076911&amp;sw=800&amp;sh=600&amp;spr=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2Fthis-meme-coin-defies-the-negative-market-trends-with-a-800-weekly-surge-details%2F&amp;hc=c121f3b568489fcc5f20435d2271ba27f3aedab4&amp;location=)

The meme coin saw the light of day in mid-March, but its price started rallying by the end of last month. It is up almost 50% on a 24-hour scale and a whopping 800% weekly. In addition, its market capitalization surpassed the $100 million mark.

CAW’s latest price explosion [coincides](https://twitter.com/crow_with_knife/status/1785418778186039558) with the asset’s launch on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. Previously, it [received](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-app-lists-crow-with-knife-caw) support from the popular cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com, which opened trading services with it.

Other meme coins that have turned into sensations in the past several months include [dogwifhat](https://cryptopotato.com/solana-meme-coin-wif-hits-ath-after-120-weekly-surge-possible-reasons/) [(WIF)](https://cryptopotato.com/solana-meme-coin-wif-hits-ath-after-120-weekly-surge-possible-reasons/), Bonk Inu (BONK), [BOOK OF MEME (BOME)](https://cryptopotato.com/book-of-meme-meme-enters-top-100-crypto-assets-days-after-launch-following-major-binance-news/), and more. Interestingly, they are all built on the Solana blockchain, whereas CAW is a token part of the Cronos ecosystem.

The rapid price movements in the meme coin sector as of late are yet another example of the cohort’s infamous volatility. If you are about to jump on the bandwagon, please check our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:

Ex-Coinbase designer raises $5M for governance startup Agora
------------------------------------------------------------

Agora, a cross-chain platform offering a new standard of governance tools for decentralized protocols, has raised $5 million in a seed funding round led by Haun Ventures. The round also saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, Seed Club Ventures, and Consensys Ventures, among others. Agora aims to help protocols organize their voting systems and tackle the often chaotic nature of token-holding voter governance.

Co-founder Yitong Zhang, a former designer at [Coinbase](https://cryptobriefing.com/coinbase-lightning-network-integration-lightspark/) said in an interview that current systems for governance voting were “chaotic.” With Agora, however, Zhang believes that users can “have all the benefits of having your equity directly on the internet without the chaos.”

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

Agora’s other co-founders, Charlie Feng and Kent Fenwick, bring experience from multibillion-dollar fintech Clearco, where Feng was a co-founder and Fenwick served as an engineering executive.

Agora has already attracted notable customers such as [Uniswap](https://cryptobriefing.com/uniswap-blast-network-yield/), [Optimism](https://cryptobriefing.com/optimism-token-funding-2024/), and Nouns. The startup plans to use the new funding to invest in its product and keep up with the increasing demand it has seen in the last quarter. The company is committed to building for the long term and open-sourcing its software under the MIT license to advance the ecosystem.

This approach has also led to contributions from various developers, governance tooling teams, and startups in the development of Agora’s API.

The company believes that token-backed voting and collective governance are the best ways to move the internet away from “walled gardens” and transition it from private enterprises to common protocols. While the Web2 era may have mastered private apps, Agora sees collective protocols as being in their infancy. Unlike static, traditional protocols like HTTP that require little to no management, crypto protocols are constantly evolving ecosystems that require consensus from a complex array of stakeholders.

According to Zhang, protocols may be perceived as “fundamentally less effective” than equity-governed apps (private companies) due to a lack of investment in tooling. Agora’s mission is to address this issue by making the development of MIT-licensed software for running protocols its top priority. The company acknowledges that the outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is challenging, but it believes the goal and timing are right.

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/peak-fud-dips-bitcoin

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin fell to $56,000 during Asian bear with the coin somewhat recovering to $58,000, but it has been showing weakness since the Israel-Iran tensions.

It has failed to keep any bounces so far as bears grab their temporary season to serve us plenty of FUD.

First, the founder of Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao is getting four months in prison for lax AML/KYC controls.

Some media is reporting it at money laundering, but banks do that sort of money laundering every day and get no more than a small fine.

While he gets prison, though hopefully a suspended sentence, and that's because regulators really did not like him not sticking to traditional structures with an HQ, and of course because of the SBF Tweet.

Then from left field we have Roger Ver, a bitcoin advocate, getting charged with tax evasion for failing to fully disclose his capital gains when he renounced his US citizenship.

Neither should really matter to the market which keeps waiting for the MT Gox coins to be distributed at potentially any moment, though no coins have moved.

To show how much bears are having fun however, huge combined inflows of $200 million in one day on Monday by the new Hong Kong ETFs were initially dismissed on social media as just $2 million volumes.

The US ETFs however continue red, with Fidelity's FBTC seeing its biggest outflow yet on Tuesday at $35 million. Same for Bitwise's BITB at $34 million while BlackRock saw its fifth day of zero inflows.

It might come as a surprise to some that ETF investors and traders are like any other investor, not least because they have market makers like Jane Street with its [vast operations](https://www.ft.com/content/54671865-4c7f-4692-a879-867ef68f0bde).

So Janet is going to sell or buy depending on whether she thinks the market thinks it will up or down, and sometime our Janet might even have funny ideas and try to move the market herself, though only on one minute candles.

That means the ETF flows are only useful to see sentiment, but not when direction turns because the live price would show that way before hand.

It does though mean the autumn anticipation of huge inflows has now played out, though only to some extent because the ETFs stopped buying only when their huge purchases were not quite moving the price up any more.

They are no where near being out of ammo, they're just not dumb. When the market turns, they'll allocate again.

In many ways this is good news because if we were at $100k right now for example, the fall might have been quicker and steeper as it would have risen too quick.

Cooling down instead and consolidating gives room for another leg up and makes the decisions both to invest and trade easier because we're in familiar territory.

Bad as this mini-bear may have been therefore, and liquidating for some, it's just part of the orchestra for a tune-y song.

In eth, their most promising dapp, EigenLayer, turned out to be a bear airdrop with their March 15 snapshot meaning most got little or nothing, while their decision to ban places like Canada indicated there's some politics behind it with the CEO so being Indian-American.

Our bear commission also took some center stage with ConsenSys suing SEC for secretly classifying eth as a security.

"New court filings indicate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of eth at a Financial Committee hearing to conduct oversight of his agency," Representative Patrick McHenry [said](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1785317163110130028).

And? What's Congress going to do about it? In UK you can be held in contempt of Parliament, which means actual prison. While for US we're finding out SEC is an "arbitrary and capricious" agency and nothing is being done about it at all.

We could maybe do something if we really wanted to, and maybe we should if he denies the Ethereum spot ETFs.

It's so difficult to see what a SEC lawyer would say in court, so such decision would be straight out political. Which means some in Silicon Valley maybe, if we really wanted to, can get Biden's ear and fire the chair.

Because there gotta be some rules somewhere. Ok, this stuff is part of the game and we've been playing it since Supernintendos, so fair enough. But this other stuff, like o I got the power and can do what I want even after being slapped by a court, well then maybe we can play it that way as well.

Not sure we're there, even if they deny the ETF. This ConsenSys lawsuit on the other hand is just putting up the lawyers' layer, our own army to fight the capo, and at this point really we'd like it very much if anything SEC related comes with 'our lawyers say.'

Not like the coward EigenLayer, which basically said: you can't imprison/fine me, I imprison myself. Though prison here is out of the question as this is civil law stuff, you get a cost of business fine at most.

We have to fight them basically, and as investors that means favoring projects which stand up to them, and not favoring those that cower at a cost of business.

Some parts of what SEC does are fair enough. It's a debate, through lawyers, courts, Congress, and we either win or get a compromise. The outcome is irrelevant from an investment perspective as long as we fight because this Eigen-censorship is the worst in giving them all they want, when we can strengthen the lawyers' layer and either get all that we want or some of it.

All of which means in the end, this is good news for eth. Its ratio is up because we're fighting and that means there's a chance of victory \[insert Churchill's voice\]. As for the security classification itself, for the ETF doesn't matter because ETFs are securities. For eth, some say it would be bad, but we don't think it matters since we're not kids anymore, we've got a lawyers' army that can deal with that stuff. At worst, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) might have to file some paperworks. What happens when its funding runs out? Well, when we get to the point of actually asking that question, the SEC paperworks will be the very least of our concerns. It shows it is not a security because EF can dissolve, while eth keeps on, but this SEC bit doesn't have much to do with the law because the law debate was closed in 2018 when we got [the eth compromise](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/06/14/ethereum-not-security-icoed-security-tokens-can-become-non-securities-says-sec).

So all the FUD then was just nonsense politics? Nothing in actual crypto? What we miss? Ah, yes more politics.

Today might be volatile because Fed's chair Jerome Powell will give the committee decision on how much your dollar unit of account should be worth according to the all knowing statisticians.

His decision will be no change, though the market will try and read whether he meant one rate cut, none, or maybe even rate hikes.

That explains yesterday's 2% red Nasdaq, with the market fixated on these rates again, or so it appears.

Just the dressing, to go with what it always does after touching ATH. It sits there and asks: are we really doing this?

A little drop, after a big rise, gives the playground to little bears, who this time have stupid and irrelevant politics as the biggest FUD.

Just narrative to massage what the price does after the fact, when the price is sitting there comfortably, saying to itself: well, obviously we're gone do this, we came this far. The question is when?

Or if, of course, it can also drop more, but lull summer is coming, when we can enjoy the beach.

Or so we hope because while the power brokers are out, it's a good time to coup governments, like in UK or Italy in 2022, or to sue Coinbase as SEC did last year.

Can't have Christmas traditions for summer peace, but volumes tend to be lower. So that can mean sidewaying, with maybe some drifting up this time.

The good news is that 'sidewaying' now includes $75k. So we'll see how long these little bears keep the microphone.

URL Source: https://u.today/market-bloodbath-500-million-worth-of-crypto-longs-liquidated

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:38:00+0000

Markdown Content:
Over $500 million worth of cryptocurrency long positions were liquidated recently, signaling a reversal on the cryptocurrency [market](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-at-end-of-correction-top-analyst-suggests). This catastrophic drop, obviously caused by Bitcoin's drop below $60,000, has not only impacted major cryptocurrencies but could cause [troubles](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) for smaller tokens.

The Bitcoin chart demonstrates a severe drop below the critical support level of $60,000, cascading down to around $57,000. This massive sell-off triggered widespread panic selling and liquidations. Such extensive liquidations can exacerbate market declines, pushing prices further down as traders rush to close positions, either voluntarily or through forced liquidations.

Interestingly, while long liquidations dominated the structure of the market, the last few hours saw a noticeable increase in short liquidations. As traders awaited further drops and positioned themselves in shorts with some leverage, a slight squeeze occurred. This unexpected shift led to a minor rebound in prices, suggesting a short-term recovery might be possible. However, do not place too much hope in it as it could be purely speculative. 

For Bitcoin, the next support level to watch is around $55,000. If this level fails to hold, the next significant support lies near the $52,000 mark. Resistance, on the other hand, can be found at $60,000 and then at $63,000. A break above these levels could signal a potential recovery, but the source for such a move remains unclear.

The current [market](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) situation paints a grim picture for the long-term outlook. The high volume of liquidations indicates a lack of confidence among investors, which could discourage the inflow of new capital essential for sustaining higher price levels. 

For smaller assets like Shiba Inu, Cardano or even [XRP](https://u.today/ripple-cto-ends-speculation-on-xrp-holdings) sentiment and investor enthusiasm, the outlook is even darker. The loss of confidence from major cryptocurrency holders can ripple down to these smaller assets, potentially leading to significant declines.

[Changpeng Zhao](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-verdict-is-in-cz-to-do-4-months-in-jail/) (CZ), founder of [Binance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/binance-bnb/), the leading digital currency exchange in the world, released his statement one month after the end of the criminal case against him and the conclusion of a sentencing hearing. 

The court imposed a term of four months of imprisonment on CZ, a lesser sentence than US authorities’ required 36 months punishment preference.

CZ\`s gratitude and acknowledgment
----------------------------------

CZ [overemphasized](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488) gratitude for the character-scrubbing of the proceedings, which he sincerely expressed by thanking everyone who supported him during the court sessions. 

&gt; I would like to thank everyone for your care and support, be it writing letters, showing support on X, or in any other form. They all mean a lot to me and keep me strong. I will do my time, conclude this phase and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).

&gt; I will remain a…
&gt; 
&gt; — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz\_binance) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1785465555899822488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

He admitted the many forms of straightforward listening: letters and public displays. These avenues gave him what he needed for the many challenging periods. He outlined his plans to stay somewhat in the picture as an investor, and his company remains the owner of the crypto world. He signaled that compliance was the most important thing in the policy.

While concluding the broader issue arising from his legal cases, he asserted that, given the growing importance of compliance in the cryptocurrency era, the company has surely entered a new phase of history. 

Under the intense supervision of legal scrutiny, the former head of the exchange opened his eyes to the silver lining of the security measures under the light of supervision. The stakeholders’ reassuring comments about the security measures headed in this direction actually put the issues of funds at rest: SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users).

Lessons learned and prospects
-----------------------------

Despite the judicial chapter drawing to a close, there was a genuine willingness on the side of CZ to serve out his sentence, which marked the end of one phase of his life and rather transition into another. 

Notwithstanding that all is not exactly well with him, he maintains a measure of resilience, having retreated to an inconspicuous position in the cryptocurrency market. the statement embraces not a single attitude but a combination of gratitude, acknowledgment, and optimism. 

These feelings relate to personal growth and positive views of the cryptocurrency industry. With time, the development of the digital assets industry, as CZ business story reflects, demonstrates the need for compliance and security to be considered when creating and trading digital assets.

**May 2024 is poised to be a pivotal month for the crypto market, influenced by several critical events that could shape its trajectory.**

From key economic indicators to significant regulatory decisions, here’s an overview of what market watchers anticipate this month.

Macroeconomic Factors: Federal Reserve Meeting and April CPI Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, concluding on May 1, is among the most anticipated events. Despite ongoing concerns about persistent [inflation](https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/), the Fed will [likely maintain the borrowing rate steady](https://beincrypto.com/fed-rates-bitcoin-inflation-hedge/) between 5.25%-5.5%.

This decision could signal a continued conservative approach amidst economic uncertainties, impacting investor sentiment in the crypto sector.

On May 2, the US Treasury Department is slated to [announce](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2315) its refunding plans for the upcoming quarter, potentially offering some relief to markets. After three consecutive quarters of increasing auction sizes, the Treasury plans to steady most of its auction sizes.

Investors are particularly keen on the details of an anticipated debt repurchase program and its implications for long-term US financing strategies amid escalating debt concerns. Although there may be increases in specific issues like the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), most auctions are expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market liquidity and interest rates.

Another noteworthy development is the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on May 15. As shelter costs contributed to over half of the 3.5% CPI [inflation rate as of March 2024](https://beincrypto.com/events-march-crypto-market-volatility/), the financial market will keep a close eye on this report. Any significant change might influence the Fed’s monetary policy, impacting crypto market stability.

BeInCrypto reported in August 2022 that the Netherlands Crime Agency (FIOD) [arrested Pertsev in Amsterdam](https://beincrypto.com/dutch-cops-arrest-29-year-old-suspected-tornado-cash-developer/) following the sanctions from the US treasury upon Tornado Cash. FIOD alleged Persev for sponsoring illicit financial flows, money laundering, and mixing cryptocurrencies through a decentralized Ethereum mixing service, Tornado Cash.

Meanwhile, other Tornado Cash developers in the US, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, [faced several charges from the Department of Justice (DOJ)](https://beincrypto.com/doj-crypto-privacy-tornado-cash/). The charges include conspiring to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions imposed by OFAC.

The crypto community keenly awaits the outcome of Tornado Cash’s case, which fears it may establish a precedent that threatens developers of privacy-focused software within the ecosystem.

SEC Decisions: The Fate of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs
----------------------------------------------------

At the end of the month, the crypto community is also anticipating the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) responses to the [spot Ethereum ETF filings](https://beincrypto.com/sec-blackrock-spot-ethereum-etf-comments/). The spotlight is on VanEck’s and ARK’s applications, with deadlines for the SEC’s decision set for May 23 and May 24, respectively.

Despite the anticipation, skepticism runs high among industry experts regarding the SEC’s approval. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, [doubts the spot Ethereum ETF approval](https://beincrypto.com/vaneck-ceo-spot-ethereum-etf-rejection/).

&gt; “The way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs — and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,” van Eck explained earlier in April.

VanEck isn’t alone in its pessimism. Industry analysts like James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence echo the sentiment. Balchunas himself reduced his approval odds from 70% to less than 35%.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently sitting on the edge, with some of its most visible metrics pointing toward an imminent sell-off. Top market analyst Ali Martinez, however, has [projected](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1785602766280286684) a very intriguing trend for the meme coin. Per his recent exposition, SHIB might be gearing up for a bullish reversal.

As noted by Ali Martinez, Shiba Inu is exhibiting a bull flag trend on the daily chart. A bull flag formation is a continuation pattern that is formed amid two major price spikes separated by a brief consolidation period. 

Shiba Inu outpaced its bearish stalemate earlier this year when its price soared as high as $0.000036 in March. The Shiba Inu trend has, however, buckled under the weight of broader market uncertainty. With the spot Bitcoin ETF losing its inflow traction, the impact has been felt for altcoins, including Shiba Inu.

With the bull flag formation, Martinez hinted at a more hyped sentiment. He revealed plans to place a buy order on the token at $0.000018343, as he is "aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323."

Shiba Inu's ambitions stumped
-----------------------------

Shiba Inu is currently changing hands for $0.00002108, [down](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/) by 8.71% in 24 hours and by more than 22% in the past week. However, it has remained elevated in the year-to-date (YTD) period, soaring by 11%.

The current [bearish market trend](https://u.today/bitcoin-sees-its-worst-monthly-decline-since-august-2023) has contributed to shifting the project’s focus from the [top 10 in ranking](https://u.today/shiba-inu-shib-might-displace-cardano-as-top-10-if-this-happens) to mere survival. Amid the 500% spike in [Shiba Inu transaction fees](https://u.today/500-spike-in-shiba-inu-token-transaction-fees-shocks-shibarium), the outlook of SHIB has not changed, with investors choosing more safety bets overall.

With Shibarium serving as a major utility and demand anchor, Shiba Inu community members are not giving up hope on the possibility of imminent revival. Martinez’s charts are also a sentiment booster that can drive prices overall.

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) held near two-month lows at the May 1 Wall Street open as risk assets braced themselves for the next United States macro move.

Bitcoin volatility cools into FOMC
----------------------------------

Data from [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://subscription.cointelegraph.com/) and [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCGBP/?exchange=BINANCE) followed skittish BTC price action hours after new lows of $56,500 on Bitstamp.

Traders remained on edge across risk assets ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next interest rates announcement and subsequent press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.

After the Quarterly Refunding Announcement, or QRA, [dealt a blow to the U.S. liquidity outlook](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-loses-60k-support-2-month-lows), market participants hoped that Powell’s tone after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting would not lean too hawkish.

“The FOMC statement and Powell presser this afternoon are likely to confirm USD money market pricing of a much more tepid policy normalization cycle,” Darius Dale, founder and CEO of risk management firm 42 Macro, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DariusDale42/status/1785617419169329344) in part of a digest on X (formerly Twitter).

&gt; “As much as Chair Powell would prefer to play up ‘two-sided risks to the economic outlook’, the reality is the preponderance of evidence supports the ‘no landing’ scenario as the highest probability outcome. As such, ‘higher for longer’ is likely to be the dominant message today.”

Fed target ra

The latest data from CME Group’s [FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) underscored the lackluster expectations for good news, with the odds of the Fed holding rates at their current levels at 99%.

Striking a more optimistic tone, popular trader CrypNuevo suggested that the worst Bitcoin and altcoin losses were likely complete.

“BTC really dropped hard and this reinforces the idea that whatever Jerome Powell has to say today, it's likely priced-in,” he [told](https://twitter.com/CrypNuevo/status/1785659617122349256/photo/1) X subscribers.

“Will we get a retest of the range lows?”

In the latest edition of its London &amp; New York Daily Color market updates sent to Telegram channel subscribers, meanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital referenced both Powell and the QRA as potentially holding surprises for risk-on sentiment.

“There are two important events happening today that could either exacerbate this bearish move or reverse it,” it stated.

&gt; “Firstly, if Powell is dovish at FOMC, it could provide a bullish flip. Secondly, if the QRA (Quarterly Refunding Announcement) sees heavy issuances in US bills (front-end) instead of the 10-year (back-end) it would reduce fears of longer-term rates spiking and might put some brakes on the USD rally.”

BTC price in "typical" bull market retrace
------------------------------------------

Bitcoin traders thus eyed important BTC price levels to watch after multiple lines in the sand fell through.

“This current Bitcoin retrace is slowly turning into an almost 50-day retrace,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital [revealed](https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1785662534487245112/photo/1) on the day.

An accompanying chart compared BTC price pullbacks throughout the bull market which began in early 2023.

Rekt Capital described the latest downside move, coming in at over 20%, as “typical” within this context.

“Typical retraces have been 2-3 weeks, longer ones up to 2 months,” he noted.

Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, meanwhile forecast a possible Bitcoin renaissance following in the footsteps of gold in recent years.

“I think we can go lower than on that chart, but if its bullish over the next months it might happen like this as a general idea,” he wrote in an [X thread](https://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1785645939149193222) while comparing the two assets.

Markdown Content:
Author Michael Lewis tends to take a very charitable stance regarding Sam Bankman-Fried despite his recent conviction, which led to a [25-year prison sentence](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sentencing/).

Following publication last year of "Going Infinite," Lewis' book about the FTX founder that many said is over-generous, a Time magazine journalist [asked him](https://time.com/6321668/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite/) about [criticisms](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/books/review/going-infinite-michael-lewis.html). "This is what happens when you address a mob," he said.

When movie rights for the book were shopped around Hollywood, the pitch letter said, as [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/14/big-short-author-michael-lewis-spent-months-with-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-and-is-writing-a-book/) in 2022, that Lewis "likens \[SBF and Binance's Changpeng "CZ" Zhao\] to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto" – and it wasn't hard to deduce that SBF was, in the "Big Short" author's view, the good guy and CZ the bad guy. SBF got a quarter century in prison. CZ was [just sentenced to four months](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-to-appear-in-court-today-for-sentencing/), and the judge, when explaining why he wasn't harsher on the former Binance CEO, said, "Everything I see about you and your characteristics are of a mitigating nature." Also: "There's no evidence that the defendant was ever informed" of illegal activity at Binance, the judge said.

Contrast that with what a judge told SBF when [deciding](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/28/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sentencing/) the length of his prison stay: "The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight." Also, SBF never offered "a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes."

Meanwhile, CZ stepped up, according to his judge: "The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility."

SBF was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. CZ pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Wrongdoing in both cases, but on completely different scales (though Binance did agree to pay a multi-billion-dollar fine.)

Lewis sold a lot of copies of his book, and a movie is [apparently being made](https://theankler.com/p/inside-hollywoods-sbf-mad-scramble-c04) via Apple. But he might want to watch "Star Wars" to remind himself who's who, if the U.S. legal system is any judge of character, anyway.

The world’s largest asset manager led a $47 million funding round by a blockchain-focused firm it has worked with before

The world’s largest asset manager appears poised to move deeper into the tokenization space after injecting capital into a tokenization firm it has worked with before.

BlackRock led a $47 million funding round for Securitize, a company focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, the firms said Wednesday. 

Fintech companies and [traditional finance giants have increasingly been testing out tokenization](https://blockworks.co/news/citibank-explores-tokenization-wisdomtree), noting that blockchain rails can help reduce costs and improve transparency. BlackRock Larry Fink has called tokenized securities “the next generation for markets.” 

To that end, [BlackRock](https://blockworks.co/tag/blackrock) and Securitize are not strangers. 

BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund — the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — in March, offering a different way to earn US dollar yields. Qualified investors can subscribe to that fund through Securitize Markets.

“We believe that [tokenization](https://blockworks.co/tag/tokenization) has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure,” Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships, said in a statement. “Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy.”  

Chalom is now a member of Securitize’s board of directors.

Other investors in the $47 million funding round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. 

Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane in January 2023 made [available](https://securitize.io/learn/press/hamilton-lane-fund-securitize-polygon) one of its equity funds through a Securitize feeder fund tokenized on Polygon.

Research

It's increasingly apparent that orderbooks represent the most efficient model for perpetual trading, with the primary obstacle being that the most popular blockchains are ill-suited for hosting a fully onchain orderbook. Hyperliquid is a perpetual trading protocol built on its own L1 that aims to replicate the user experience of centralized exchanges while offering a fully onchain orderbook.
