**Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) advantages of multi-signature wallets over hardware wallets.**

Buterin highlighted crucial considerations for crypto holders worldwide to keep their assets secure.

Multi-Signature Wallets Over Hardware Wallets
---------------------------------------------

Buterin [stressed](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1785562273433387320) the significance of employing multi-signature wallets to safeguard personal funds. He revealed that he utilizes this method for over 90% of his assets. 

With [multi-signature wallets](https://beincrypto.com/learn/metamask-vs-coinbase/), the control over funds is distributed among multiple parties, known as “keys.” Therefore, Buterin advocates for an M-of-N approach. This entails the user holding some keys while the remainder is entrusted to other individuals, forming a decentralized security network. 

Buterin also advised against disclosing the identities of these trusted parties to each other to ensure an added layer of privacy and security.

Addressing the potential pitfalls of [hardware wallets](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ledger-vs-trezor/), Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, [highlighted](https://x.com/ptrwtts/status/1785442008925893064) the inherent risks posed by human error. Watts cautioned against scenarios where users inadvertently compromise their security, such as misplacing seed phrases or hastily relocating without access to essential [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/) components. 

&gt; “When using a [hardware wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-on-the-best-hardware-wallets-in-2024/), the biggest risk becomes yourself,” Watts said.

This reflects the importance of user vigilance and responsible storage practices, as even the most secure hardware wallets are susceptible to user-related vulnerabilities.

Buterin and Watts’ endorsement of multi-signature wallets aligns with the broader industry consensus on enhancing security protocols. Indeed, prioritizing robust security measures is fundamental to risk mitigation and asset protection.

**April 2024 witnessed a remarkable 141% reduction in financial damages due to crypto-related [security](https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/) exploits, with losses totaling a historic low of $25.7 million.** 

This figure represents the smallest amount recorded since 2021, suggesting a significant improvement in Crypto security measures.

Crypto Security Exploits Drop, Indicating Enhanced Its Safety
-------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto security firm CertiK [highlighted](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1785262226430926997) that the sharp decrease in damages was primarily due to fewer exploits targeting blockchain protocols. The bulk of the April losses, amounting to $21 million, arose from [DeFi](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-decentralized-finance-revolution/) platform attacks.

The repeated breach of FixedFloat’s Ethereum-based hot [wallet](https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/) resulted in a $2.8 million loss. The same group was responsible for a February attack, which cost the exchange $26 million, perpetrated this incident.

&gt; “Combining all the incidents in April, we’ve confirmed ~$ $25.7 m lost to exploits, hacks, and [scams](https://beincrypto.com/learn/common-cryptocurrency-scams/). This is the lowest figure we’ve recorded, dating back to 2021, and it is a 141% decrease from March,” CertiK said. 

Additionally, exit scams accounted for $4.3 million in losses. These frauds, where founders absconded with invested funds, included notable incidents like the suspected [rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino](https://beincrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-zero-knowledge-misuse/). This is under investigation for potentially diverting $32 million in Ethereum.

Only three major incidents in April exceeded the $1 million threshold, reflecting a strengthening in [protocol security.](https://beincrypto.com/blockchain-security-slowmist-new-crypto-scam/) Among these, the [tokenization](https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-tokenization/) platform Grandbase suffered a $2 million theft due to a compromised private key, which led to unauthorized token minting and subsequent robbery.

CertiK’s analysis points to an encouraging trend of resilience within the [cryptocurrency industry despite ongoing challenges](https://beincrypto.com/us-recovers-millions-crypto-fraudsters/). The reduction in private key compromises and the lower frequency of high-value breaches suggest that enhanced security practices are becoming more effective.

Fewer key compromises and exit scams are pointed as the reasons behind the record fall.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto protocols witnessed $25.7 million in losses across three major incidents in April, reaching a record low since 2021. Blockchain security firm CertiK highlights that this is a 141% decrease from March’s figures.

The reduction in losses is due to the fall in private key compromise incidents, which plummeted from eleven in March to just three in April, CertiK underscored.

[![Image 1: Sapphire](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18060845/600x500.jpg)](https://sapphire.cryptobriefing.com/?utm_source=cryptobriefing&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=180324&amp;ap=mreciad&amp;offer=x240415070T0U7V)

The largest exploit in April involved FixedFloat, with suspicious withdrawals totaling approximately $3 million across multiple chains. FixedFloat acknowledged this as their second exploit by the same attackers since February.

Meanwhile, exit scams also saw a downturn, with the most notable being CondomSol’s pre-sale scam on the Solana network, leading to losses of around $933,000. In total, April experienced 13 exit scams, a 40% reduction from the previous month.

![Image 2: Crypto losses caused by exploits fall 141% in April: CertiK](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20571%20887'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Flash loan attacks in April resulted in the lowest monthly losses since February 2022, with four incidents totaling $129,086. The largest of these accounted for $55,000. Combining all incidents, April’s losses amounted to approximately $25.7 million, the lowest on record since 2021.

However, the brief CertiK report on April losses does not account for the ZKasino controversy. ZKasino’s co-founders allegedly performed an exit scam on April 25, by swapping nearly $33 million worth of Ether (ETH) for their native token ZKAS. The funds were locked on the gambling platform bridge, as users tried to be eligible for ZKAS airdrop.

URL Source: https://decrypt.co/229020/bitcoin-senator-cynthia-lummis-blasts-doj-stance-crypto-wallets

Markdown Content:
United States Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has stated that she is "deeply troubled" by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) stance on non-custodial software.

In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367), Lummis expressed concern at the DOJ's "hyper-aggressive argument that non-custodial software can constitute a money transmission service." She added that the DOJ's stance "contradicts existing Treasury guidance," and "violates the rule of law."

"Arguments against self-custody software threaten the fundamental property rights that are core to being an American," Lummis said, adding that she will fight "for your rights to hold your own keys and run your own node." She further accused the Biden Administration of "criminalizing core tenants of the [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) network and [decentralized finance](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance)."

Lummis' comments follow two recent cases where DOJ prosecutors have pushed for criminal charges against software developers for unlicensed money transmission: an unsealed indictment against Bitcoin mixer [Samourai Wallet](https://decrypt.co/227949/feds-arrest-founders-bitcoin-mixer-samourai-wallet), and a [reply brief](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.53.0.pdf) responding to the defense's motion to dismiss in the [case](https://decrypt.co/news-explorer?pinned=277556&amp;title=tornado-cash-co-founder-roman-storm-arrested-for-money-laundering) against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.

&gt; I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.
&gt; 
&gt; My full statement. ⬇️ [pic.twitter.com/M3CHcNTi3x](https://t.co/M3CHcNTi3x)
&gt; 
&gt; — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) [May 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1785695683514630367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The DOJ's interpretation of money transmission laws, encompassing wallet developers who have no direct control over user assets, has sparked a backlash among the crypto community.

Crypto advocacy group [Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org/dojs-new-stance-on-crypto-wallets-is-a-threat-to-liberty-and-the-rule-of-law/) has characterized the DOJ's stance as "a massive overreach," arguing that it contradicts [existing FinCEN guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf) and [rulings](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/administrative-rulings/application-fincens-regulations-virtual).

In a blog post, Coin Center's director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh claimed the DOJ's position would mean that "every functioning cryptocurrency wallet and smart contract is 'doing' money transmission and every developer is engaged in unlicensed money transmission."

The group has filed an [amicus brief](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-files-a-court-brief-in-defense-of-tornado-cash-developer/) in defense of Roman Storm, arguing that the publication of Tornado Cash's code is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-could-crash-to-50k-predicts-800-billion-bank/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:08:46+00:00

Markdown Content:
As the [cryptocurrency landscape](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/) undergoes a volatile shift, [Standard Chartered](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/), a global banking behemoth, has voiced concerns about  Bitcoin’s ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) price trajectory, suggesting it might drop to the $50,000 mark.

_Geoffrey Kendrick_, head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at [Standard Chartered,](https://finbold.com/guide/buy-bitcoin-with-standard-chartered/) has voiced concerns after Bitcoin’s recent dip below $60,000, indicating a potential drop toward $50,000-$52,000, according to [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/bitcoin-could-drop-further-to-as-low-as-50k-standard-chartered-says/).

Adding to the [crypto](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) market’s challenges are the significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin [ETF](https://finbold.com/etfs/)s and tepid interest in Hong Kong’s newly launched [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://finbold.com/guide/what-is-bitcoin-etf/), the factors Kendrick cites as primary reasons for the recent downturn.

### Picks for you

Key factors include five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and prices falling below the ETFs’ average purchase price. Furthermore, the average purchase price of these ETFs falling below $58,000 increases the risk of liquidation, especially since more than half of these ETF positions are incurring losses.

Additionally, the bank pointed out that the launch of the Hong Kong spot ETF did not meet expectations, with the focus on the low turnover volume of $11 million overshadowing the satisfactory net asset position of the new ETFs.

The broader economic environment hasn’t been supportive either, with tightening liquidity measures in the U.S. which have been worsening since mid-April, exerting additional pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.

Long-term optimism despite current volatility
---------------------------------------------

Despite these immediate challenges, Standard Chartered remains [bullish](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The bank recently revised its [end-of-2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-to-hit-150000-after-halving.html) Bitcoin price prediction upward from $100,000 to $150,000.

The bank recommends purchasing Bitcoin if it falls to the $50,000-$52,000 range, or if the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th, which measures inflation, is favorable.

While the market currently faces downward pressure, the underlying momentum and institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin might rebound strongly. This belief is anchored in the crypto’s past performance and its foundational role in the digital asset space, pointing towards recovery as market conditions improve and as strategic investments in the ecosystem continue to unfold.

A prospective stablecoin bill will likely not be included in upcoming must-pass Federal Aviation Administration legislation as lawmakers try to get the bill across the finish line. House and Senate leadership have indicated the FAA will be "clean" of bills lawmakers have been looking to attach, so it is unlikely that a stablecoin bill will be included, according to a Democratic aide. Lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., ranking Democrat Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had reportedly discussed attaching the bill to upcoming FAA reauthorization, which could accompany cannabis legislation. That must-pass reauthorization is up against a May 10 deadline.

If you think the recent dips in the price of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) is bad, leading financial firm Standard Chartered could further darken your mood, concluding that the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap could fall as far as $50,000.

In a Wednesday note, Geoffrey Kendrick—digital assets researcher at the British company and lead author of the report—said that “the broader macro backdrop has deteriorated for assets like crypto that thrive on liquidity.”

“The driver seems to be a combination of crypto specific and broader macro,” he added, noting that Bitcoin’s break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-$52,000 range.

[Bitcoin Will Hit $100K in 2024, Predicts Standard Chartered—Again](https://decrypt.co/207767/bitcoin-will-hit-100k-in-2024-predicts-standard-chartered-again)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by next year, British multinational bank Standard Chartered has said.  The bank made its first bullish predictions back in April, predicting that the largest digital coin would hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.  In July, its team of analysts projected that Bitcoin could hit $120,000 in the same timeframe.  While the protracted bear market that dominated 2023 is only recently showing signs of thawing, the bank is again saying Bitcoin could hit $100,000—and that a Bitcoin...

Just last month, Standard Chartered [predicted](https://decrypt.co/227946/bitcoin-price-prediction-150000-in-2024-standard-chartered) that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 per coin by the end of the year.

Bitcoin had been on a wild run following the January [approval](https://decrypt.co/210763/bitcoin-etf-approved-sec) of 11 [Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-etf-explained-guide-learn-easy) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At the start of the year, it was trading for a little over $44,000. 

Capital flooded the market as investors with typically no exposure to cryptocurrencies were suddenly able to buy shares that track the price of the asset via brokerage accounts. 

Record amounts of money [hit the products](https://decrypt.co/219726/bitcoin-etf-record-inflows-673-million-one-day-blackrock) in the months following their launch, and in March, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $73,737.

But the hype has cooled, and the Federal Reserve has meanwhile signaled it will keep interest rates higher for longer—scaring investors away from “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin.

As a result, the funds have experienced significant outflows. 

Despite touching a new record in March, the [price of Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) today stands at $56,900, after dropping 13% in seven days. Since April, it has traded well below its 2021 record of $69,044.

URL Source: https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/uk-government-publishes-new-cryptocurrency-report-here-are-the-details/

Markdown Content:
A new report published by the UK government's financial arm has revealed that cryptocurrency companies, along with retail banking, wholesale banking and asset management, are among the top money laundering risks between 2022 and 2023.

The report's conclusions were drawn from risk assessments carried out on 238 firms by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA, a financial regulator in the United Kingdom, has been trying to get crypto firms to register with it and comply with money laundering rules since 2020.

According to the report, the United Kingdom is making intense efforts to suppress cryptocurrency-related crimes. In October 2022, UK police announced that they were deploying crypto tactical advisors across the country to assist in the seizure of digital assets linked to criminal activity. The National Police Chiefs' Council reported that they managed to seize hundreds of millions worth of crypto from crimes.

Data from the newly published report showed that between 2022 and 2023 the FCA had 52 full-time financial crime specialist staff dedicated to anti-money laundering supervision. Of these, 15 were focused on regulating crypto businesses.

URL Source: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-optimism-fades-amid-second-longest-run-of-weekly-red-candles/

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:18:51+00:00

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) is experiencing a significant downturn, marking its second-longest streak of weekly red candles in its history. This development has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with investors expressing concern over the potential implications for the [cryptocurrency](https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/)‘s future.

Starting on April 1, Bitcoin began a five-week losing streak, opening at $71,300 and dropping to $57,300 by May 1. This situation is particularly noteworthy as it comes in the midst of a supposed [bull market](https://finbold.com/guide/bull-market-definition/) directly following the Bitcoin halving event.

Historically, Bitcoin has only experienced similar losing streaks in [bear market](https://finbold.com/guide/bear-market-definition) cycles, making the current situation unique and raising questions about its implications.

### Picks for you

Nevertheless, the trading week is not over, and a rally above $71,300 would revert this 5-week losing streak.

The _Bitcoin Archive_ account on [X](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-x-stock/) highlighted the significance of this downturn in a [post](https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1785686389738127380), comparing it to past events.

&gt; “Bitcoin is 23% off its all-time high. So why does it feel worse than it is? This is the second-longest run of RED weekly candles in Bitcoin history! Both times were deep into a bear market.”

![Image 1: a chart showing the price of btc](https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/5-week-red-streak-Bitcoin-1024x593.jpg)

Despite the current situation, the _Bitcoin Archive_ offered some perspective. The analyst pointed out that after the last red candle streak, Bitcoin experienced a six-month run of green monthly candles, followed by another five months of gains.

This historical precedent suggests that while the current situation may be alarming, it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bear market.

Short-term bearish forecast amid a weekly red streak
----------------------------------------------------

Adding to the uncertainty, [Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin could drop as low as $50,000](https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-could-crash-to-50k-predicts-800-billion-bank/). This forecast comes amid a broader context of market speculation and various predictions about Bitcoin’s future price movements.

However, it is essential to note that many factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, influence Bitcoin’s price.

In this context, potential [Bitcoin miners’ capitulation surges as revenue drops to a six-month low](https://finbold.com/capitulation-incoming-bitcoin-miners-revenue-drops-to-a-6-month-low/) of $30 million. Moreover, [long-position traders were liquidated for $400 million in losses](https://finbold.com/long-position-traders-lost-400-million-in-a-24-hour-bloodbath/) since April 30.

Given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Bitcoin will continue its downward trend or rebound to new highs. Investors and market observers will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds in the coming weeks and months.

In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent performance has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with concerns over a potential bear market emerging. Yet, historical precedents and the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market suggest that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

As always, investors and market participants should exercise caution and stay informed about the latest developments in the rapidly evolving world of [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/).

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38559762/who-is-binances-new-ceo-richard-teng-and-can-he-fill-czs-shoes

Markdown Content:
The crypto world was rocked when **Changpeng Zhao**, the enigmatic founder and CEO of **Binance** BNB/USD, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering (AML) [program at the cryptocurrency exchange.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38532677/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison)

While Zhao’s legal troubles were brewing, his successor, **Richard Teng**, had already quietly assumed the reins as CEO, tasked with steering the exchange through this turbulent period.

Who is Teng and what does his leadership mean for the future of Binance?

**Richard Teng: A Regulator Steps In**

Prior to taking the helm at Binance, Teng held a crucial role as the Chief Compliance Officer, leveraging his experience as a former regulator at Singapore’s central bank.

This background positions him strategically to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges.

Teng’s leadership has been marked by a clear focus on compliance.

He has publicly acknowledged the need for significant changes within Binance, stating that the exchange’s previous approach to regulation was “inadequate.”

This shift is evident in several key initiatives, including:

*   **Establishing a Global Headquarters:** Previously operating with a decentralized structure, Binance is now actively seeking a physical headquarters, a move that signals a willingness to cooperate with regulatory bodies.
*   **Re-entering Regulated Markets:** Binance has made efforts to re-enter markets like India and Thailand, demonstrating a commitment to adhering to local regulations.
*   **Increased Transparency:** Teng has emphasized the importance of transparency and user protection, initiatives that could potentially rebuild trust with regulators and users alike.

Before joining Binance, Teng was recognized for his innovative regulatory approaches at Abu Dhabi Global Market and had pivotal roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange​​.

His expertise is seen as pivotal in navigating Binance through its complex regulatory challenges, especially after the company agreed to a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over accusations of violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws​.

Under Teng’s leadership, Binance is not just focusing on rectifying past issues but is also pushing forward with new initiatives.

The company has ramped up its compliance measures, strategically hiring key talents from regulatory bodies and major financial institutions.

This focus on compliance is part of Teng’s broader strategy to foster trust and ensure Binance’s growth in the highly scrutinized cryptocurrency market​​.

Moreover, Teng is setting his sights on broadening Binance's operations, with significant expansions in the Middle East and Europe.

The United Arab Emirates and France have been chosen as regional headquarters, reflecting Teng’s familiarity with the MENA region and the strategic importance of the European market under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation​.

**Challenges And Uncertainties Remain**

Despite these efforts, Binance still faces significant challenges.

The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.US, Zhao, and Teng himself, alleging unregistered exchange operations and commingling of user funds, looms large.

Additionally, regulatory scrutiny in various regions continues to cast a shadow over the exchange’s global operations.

**The Road Ahead: A New Era For Binance?**

While Zhao’s return after his sentence is expected, the long-term impact of his imprisonment and the changing regulatory landscape remain to be seen.

Richard Teng’s leadership presents an opportunity for Binance to embrace a more compliant and transparent approach, potentially paving the way for a new era of stability and growth.

However, navigating the intricate web of global regulations and regaining the trust of both regulators and users will be a monumental task.

The success of Teng’s leadership will hinge on his ability to effectively address these challenges and steer Binance towards a more sustainable future.

**Looking Towards The Future Of Digital Assets**

Events like Benzinga’s [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) on Nov. 19 will be crucial platforms for industry leaders and experts to dissect the evolving regulatory landscape and its impact on major players like Binance.

Amid an apparently growing crackdown on the crypto industry from American regulators, U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Block, the Jack Dorsey-founded company behind Square and Cash App.

Federal prosecutors have been probing the internal processes of the company—including its crypto business—according to a report from [_NBC News_](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181) published Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.

Prosecutors are reportedly investigating "alleged widespread and yearslong compliance lapses," per the report, guided by a former employee who provided information regarding such issues.

Block allegedly handled crypto transactions from terrorist groups, the report claims, and otherwise handled "thousands of transactions" from economically sanctioned countries such as Iran, Russia, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela.

It’s getting easier to get your hands on Bitcoin. And Jack Dorsey’s payments company Block aims to go a step further for Square retail customers thanks to a new feature announced Wednesday. The company said that stores using its Square tech will now be able to automatically convert a portion of daily sales into the cryptocurrency, in tandem with Block's own Cash App product for consumers. Block—which rebranded from Square Inc. in 2021—is the company behind both popular payment products. Square s...

Furthermore, the report alleges that the company did not address such compliance lapses when alerted, and that "most" of the transactions in question—including those pertaining to Bitcoin transactions—were not reported to the government.

Block did not immediately respond to _Decrypt_'s request for comment. The company provided the following statement to _NBC News_:

“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

*   **Ripple has just made a major move into the Japanese market through a partnership with HashKey DX.**
*   **This expansion has occurred amidst ongoing regulatory challenges in the US.**
*   **XRP has experienced an initial surge, but a pullback caused by Bitcoin has raised questions about its future trajectory.**

[Ripple](https://dailycoin.com/ripple-xrp-xrp-industry-leader-or-cryptocurrency-dinosaur/), a leading blockchain solutions provider, has partnered with HashKey DX, a Tokyo-based blockchain consulting firm. This collaboration marks Ripple’s expansion into the Japanese market, aiming to revolutionize supply chain finance for Japanese enterprises through the use of [XRP Ledger](https://dailycoin.com/xrp-ledger-xrpl-ripple-scalable-blockchain/) technology.

Ripple’s XRP Takes Aim at Japanese Market
-----------------------------------------

The [partnership](https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1785128947870507420) leverages the efficiency and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain platform known for its rapid settlement speeds. This technology will be utilized to address the complexities of enterprise-level financial operations in Japan, particularly within supply chain finance.

This move builds upon HashKey Group’s success in China, where their blockchain solutions have significantly boosted trade and financing operations. Together with SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple, the partnership will introduce innovative solutions specifically designed for the Japanese market.

Ripple’s expansion into Japan is crucial, as the company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Despite these challenges, the announcement has generated positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s native token, [XRP](https://dailycoin.com/ripple-xrp-xrp-industry-leader-or-cryptocurrency-dinosaur/), experienced an initial price surge, reflecting optimism surrounding its Japanese expansion efforts.

XRP Price Pulls Back After Recent Gains
---------------------------------------

However, XRP’s price has since experienced a pullback, trading around $0.493. This volatility is further underscored by XRP’s declining price over recent months, falling approximately 21% year-to-date.

Several hurdles lie ahead for XRP, including trading below key exponential moving averages and a scheduled 1 billion token unlock on May 1, valued at roughly $493.4 million. This monthly sell-off could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price in the coming weeks.

The market’s Relative Strength Index hovers near the 35 mark, indicating a balanced state between buyers and sellers. However, as it nears oversold territory, the future trajectory of XRP remains uncertain, especially with Bitcoin’s recent drop adding more pressure. Investors are now waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next significant price movement.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **If Bitcoin doesn’t recover from its drop below $60,000, it could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price.**
*   **The Relative Strength Index sits near 35, suggesting a balanced market with no clear buying or selling pressure.**

Why This Matters
----------------

This partnership marks a significant step for Ripple’s international expansion, particularly considering the established success of HashKey’s blockchain solutions in China. By focusing on revolutionizing supply chain finance within the Japanese market, Ripple positions itself to potentially disrupt a crucial sector and gain a strong foothold in a historically receptive crypto market.

The FED interest rate decision, which was eagerly awaited by the cryptocurrency and traditional markets, was finally shared with all investors.

The Fed decided to leave the interest rate steady. The expectation was that interest rates would be kept constant.

Here is Bitcoin's first reaction after the decision:

![Image 1](https://www.bitcoinsistemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ekran-goruntusu-2024-05-01-210219.png)

Now all eyes are on FED President Jerome Powell. Powell is expected to make a speech at 21:30 GMT after the FED's third meeting of the year. You can follow all the details of this speech live on Bitcoinsistemi.com.

At the close of the two-day meeting that started on Tuesday, the FED was expected to keep the short-term interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. FED officials are not planned to update their March forecasts for the economy, inflation and interest rates. But Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may offer clues about where he thinks interest rates are headed.

Interest rates have been trending sideways for months. Forecasters predicted that the first interest rate cut would be made in June and that there would be a total of three interest rate cuts by 2024. Now they are predicting only one discount in September.

Economic forecasters will be scrutinizing Jerome Powell's words very carefully when he talks about where interest rates might go.

Economists at Goldman Sachs and Barclays expect Powell to reiterate his earlier comment today that “it will likely take longer than expected to achieve the greater confidence” needed to cut interest rates.

Barclays economist March Giannoni doesn't expect Powell “to be very specific about the number of reductions.”

![Image 1: Binance: After CZ's arrest, these execs prompt global 'manhunt'](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20686'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

*   _Nigerian authorities are pursuing Binance executives for currency devaluation._
*   _Contrasting legal outcomes raised questions about fairness in treatment._

Just as [Binance’s \[BNB\]](https://ambcrypto.com/category/binance-news/) founder made headlines for a [4-month](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-billionaire-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/) prison sentence on money laundering charges, Nigeria intensified its pursuit of two Binance officers from Africa. 

On February 2024, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional head for Africa, and his colleague, Binance’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer Tigran Gambaryan, faced accusations for allegedly facilitating the devaluation of the Naira (Nigeria’s official currency). 

#### **The reason behind Binance head’s escape** 

Despite being invited for discussions to resolve tensions, their visit took an unexpected turn. Detained by security agencies, they were pushed into a legal mess, prompting Anjarwalla’s daring escape.

This incident ignited a global pursuit, escalating concerns about the intersection of cryptocurrency and international law enforcement. 

Remarking on the same, Mr. Gabra Omar, Vice President of the Interpol Africa Executive Committee on Extradition in a recent [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIaM_Z_v2Y) with Sunrise Daily noted, 

&gt; “As soon as this individual escaped, there was a massive manhunt for this individual.”

He added, 

&gt; “We have done that to make sure that he doesn’t escape justice…one day he will be brought to justice. It’s just a matter of time.”

#### **The dichotomy of punishments** 

However, in an unexpected twist, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a [four-month](https://ambcrypto.com/hnt-cryptos-45-surge-will-it-break-through-to-10-or-fall-back/) prison sentence, contrary to the Department of Justice’s expectation of at least three years.

In contrast, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder, faced a severe downfall, resulting in a 25-year prison term for fraud.

This juxtaposition highlighted potential disparities in the legal treatment of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world. 

#### **Interpol’s VP confident in extradition efforts**

Nigeria’s proactive stance against money laundering and terrorism financing in the crypto sphere isn’t a recent development.

The recent freeze of more than 1,100 accounts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) underlines this commitment. 

Furthermore, the potential extension of the crypto crackdown to platforms such as Bybit, KuCoin, and OKX underscores Nigeria’s ongoing efforts in this regard. 

Ergo, Omar is confident in the extradition of Binance’s Anjarwalla, claiming, 

&gt; “You hide, we smoke you out!”

EigenLayer, the Ethereum "restaking" project that quickly shot to the top ranks of the DeFi leaderboards thanks to so-called airdrop farmers, finally acknowledged plans to launch its own EIGEN token. The terms of the planned airdrop – or "stakedrop" as Eigen Foundation described it – left many traders disappointed, especially [those who failed to manage their expectations](https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1785312630908866583). And there were also lots of questions about how the EIGEN tokenomics will work – and when. In this week's episode, we attempt to simplify it all; readers should manage their expectations.

Network news

**INTERSUBJECTIFYING THE FORKIFICATION:** The Ethereum restaking project **EigenLayer,** whose plan to repurpose the Ethereum blockchain's security to hordes of additional protocols has prompted [systemic risk warnings from Vitalik Buterin himself](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/17/ethereum-restaking-worries-vitalik-buterin-heres-why/), released a [43-page whitepaper](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf) on its forthcoming EIGEN token – more than twice as long as the original [19-page whitepaper](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/assets/files/EigenLayer_WhitePaper-88c47923ca0319870c611decd6e562ad.pdf) on EigenLayer. To address the concerns, the project, led by the [sesquipedalian](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sesquipedalian) computer engineer [Sreeram Kannan](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-protocol/eigenlayers-blueprint-for-a-decentralized-trust-network/), came up with a new plan for something called "intersubjective forking." The purpose of this mechanism would be to take care of "instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved." If such an "intersubjective fault" were to occur, the EIGEN token could be forked without having to fork the main Ethereum blockchain. Are you with me so far? Well, there's a catch, according to a [blog post](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/eigen/): Very little of this will be functional when the EIGEN token launches: "With its design being completely novel, the concept needs to be absorbed and discussed widely by the ecosystem participants. The initial implementation of intersubjective staking at this launch mirrors the full protocol to only a limited extent. However, there are still several parameters that need to be determined for full actuation." Such a not-really-fully-functional system would echo EigenLayer's mainnet launch a few weeks ago, where, as [detailed by Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/10/eigenlayer-cryptos-biggest-project-launch-this-year-is-still-missing-crucial-functionality/), crucial promised features, including the paramount "slashing" and "attributable security" mechanisms, were held back from the launch, because they weren't ready. It goes without saying that a lot of these details were lost on crypto traders who had poured some $15 billion of deposits into the project, many of them merely hoping to qualify for the EIGEN token airdrop that roughly zero people in crypto doubted would eventually come. The [parsimoniousness of the terms](https://blog.eigenfoundation.org/announcement/), however, apparently left many of these so-called airdrop farmers wanting. "Not all feedback was glowing," as the [Bankless newsletter put it](https://www.bankless.com/mixed-eigen-feelings), and complaints centered partly on the token's initial period of "non-transferability." Only 15% of the tokens will go to the "stakedrop" – the Eigen Foundation's term – and more than half of the tokens will be allocated to investors and early contributors, with unlocks starting after just one year.

[![Image 3: Intersubjectively attributable faults](https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/pLrwt5jHLem5b4MHCmSx1AaE6bk=/560x304/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/2IPFEYUDYJFSLDZ2PIA3CN34WM.png)](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf)

_In this schematic from the EIGEN token whitepaper, "intersubjectively attributable faults" lies somewhere between "objectively attributable faults" and "subjective faults."_


**MIXING IT UP:** Ratcheting up a campaign against creators of blockchain protocols allegedly used to facilitate money laundering, U.S. prosecutors charged **Samourai Wallet** founders Keonne Rodriguez, 35, and William Lonergan Hill, 65, with [conspiracy to commit money laundering](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/24/samourai-wallet-founders-arrested-and-charged-with-money-laundering/). Rodriguez has [pleaded not guilty](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/29/samourai-wallet-co-founder-keonne-rodriguez-pleads-not-guilty-released-on-1m-bond/). Samourai Wallet was (its servers have been seized) a bitcoin wallet that promised to "keep your transactions private and your identity masked” through a privacy-preserving service called "Whirlpool," as [reported by CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/25/samourai-wallet-charges-raise-existential-questions-for-privacy-tech/). U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has ramped up efforts to knock down these coin "mixing" services. That includes arresting Bitcoin Fog operator Roman Sterlingov [in April 2021](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/us-officials-arrest-alleged-operator-of-336m-bitcoin-mixing-service/) and participating in the arrest of the co-founders of [Tornado Cash](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/27/doj-disputes-roman-storms-characterization-of-tornado-cash-operations-in-new-filing/) in 2023. The cases are prompting a fresh examination of the legal issues around open-source software. [Is code speech?](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/distilling-the-tornado-cash-and-samourai-suits/) Late last week, companies behind the popular Lightning wallet Phoenix and privacy-preserving Wasabi Wallet [took steps to close off access to U.S. customers](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/29/as-wasabi-wallet-and-phoenix-leave-the-us-whats-next-for-non-custodial-crypto/) – raising the additional question of whether blockchain innovation is more likely to occur outside the U.S. due to regulatory pressure or uncertainty.

Bitcoin Price Snaps Record 7-Month Winning Streak
-------------------------------------------------

Predictions earlier this year that bitcoin might not see a big rally in connection with last month's quadrennial halving proved true, in hindsight. The bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) price slid 15% in April, snapping a seven-month winning streak that was the longest in trading data going back to 2012.

Even so, bitcoin managed to lose less than every other coin in the [CoinDesk 20](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/) index of digital assets. The index itself fell 26%.

Amid the market selloff, [NEAR](https://www.coindesk.com/price/near-protocol/) held up the best among smart-contract blockchains. Aptos's [APT](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aptos/) lost 53%.

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/bitcoin-etf-selling-greens-eths-ratio

Markdown Content:
The six months long ETF advantage that bitcoin has enjoyed seems to be over for now. That brings it back into a somewhat equal footing with eth.

Ethereum's value against bitcoin fell and fell as the bitcoin ETFs drove the show. Now it is rising as they temporarily exit.

Back in October when the ETF story started, eth was above 0.06 BTC. Since then it fell even below 0.047, but now it trades above 0.05 and might head for that 0.06 again.

That's if it gets an eth season. Everyone has had one. Bitcoin, Solana, memecoins, but not eth. It will at some point.

When? Well, eth is the only crypto to get an ETF during Asia trading hours. Their debut coincided with a mini-bear, but the $200 million inflows on the first day suggest the Hong Kong ETFs have been underestimated.

It's the Labour Day holiday in many places across the world today, celebrating the workers, so we didn't get any HK inflows overnight. Tonight therefore we'll start getting a better idea on whether the opening day was a blip.

If it keeps at even $100 million to start with, then the US outflows should be cancelled, easing pressure on bitcoin.

Eth doesn't have that pressure at all - in isolation, focusing on just these ETFs - so any buy is a buy for eth, no cancelling as such.

On the minus side, eth is getting circa 20% of the bitcoin inflows in HK, which is what you'd expect, even if we disagree as eth's market cap, $350 billion, looks undervalued to bitcoin's $1.1 trillion.

The allocation ratio may change if there is an eth season, when Asia can play - unlike US - including the Chinese which of course can access HK markets, just not through mainland brokers.

But even if it remains the same, the bitcoin ratio should change because it is pure new demand for eth, while for bitcoin it is cancelling supply, if that.

Ethereum therefore has been showing strength. Bitcoin fell to what at $75k would look like a calamity, $57k. Ethereum fell from $3000 to $2800 recently, which would look bad from $4k, but not for the more recent price action.

Yet eth is not quite bulling. It's more resisting better than saying 'we're taking the show boys.' Why, is a very big question.

Part of the answer may be that bitcoin has only now kind of given the stage. Usually there's some calm as the market digests, unless we go more down and that's the stage.

Once this down boy gets off however, and the market decides he is off, we get the little cryptos usually showing excitement first, with eth following or this time eth is the 'little' one.

Of course, an approval of the eth ETFs by SEC would be a big catalyst sometime later this month, but issuers' comments suggest they are more likely to deny it.

That will show that the executive in America has become far, far too arrogant and needs some chains by the taxpayer, but that's a long term thing. Shorter term, our hope is we see a demand for punitive damages, which are basically a fine that the court can impose when the lawsuit inevitably follows.

Presuming denial, it's always difficult to foresee what can green it, but somewhat easy to see what commentary would follow if it does green without a specific catalyst.

Airdrops are currently not very bull because EigenLayer has been a bit stingy and even political in banning places like Canada, or the nice beaches and sunshine of Albania, a NATO country and almost in the EU. Like, what?

But, they're just one of many. Renzo just airdropped at a bit of an inopportune time, so their's isn't worth much either, but that's during a mini-bear.

A dapp called Ionic airdrops tomorrow. Another one called ZeroLend airdrops on Monday. An L2 called Mode airdrops on Sunday, and these are just the ones we've played with.

Would we buy any of them? Renzo maybe because the way we see this dapp is as running staking and restaking infrastructure, basically Lido. They're new, we haven't had time to even look at the team, but staking infrastructure has an obvious business case.

The other ones don't seem to have any uniqueness, except that they participated in the points season, but it depends on execution and that's unpredictable.

Beyond points season, the chances that eth does fully scale in a fairly reasonable time, by the next cycle, have increased.

It's possible to see now how we can go mainstream in usage, and eth would probably be the one to pave the way.

Cracking scaling opens up tons of opportunities and the lawyers barricade that is now being established might allow for more of those opportunities to be executed.

One daring aspect is DePIN, as they're calling it. Decentralized physical infrastructure. This has always somewhat been around, paying tokens to trade solar energy or wifi - though they talk more about computers for AI - but it now has reached the stage of having its own acronym and a new word for the dictionary.

The China crypto exchanges ban in 2017 put a lot of that depin stuff on the back burner, but if we have reached the stage where we can start again, that would be excellent news.

A lot of it is very cool stuff, things like common ownership of drones at the more imaginative end, but it is hard stuff and it's actual innovation which is both risky and can be slow.

The way we see it though at the very high level where investors are concerned is as basically opening up the markets to the crypto way outside of just finance.

The idea of the project doesn't matter in the face of the far bigger idea: reviving industry by bringing our financial code innovations to industry.

Another way of saying it is capitalism for all, not just the rich and not just in finance/code. That means the lawyers army will need a boost if this works out, but it is necessary both because the only way out of stagnation outside of the Magnificent Seven is growth and because we have to do it, cleverly, if the more stupid ones are to not get more stupid ideas.

DePin: so new, we have not yet red even one article on it, yet so old we know it is super cool, but execution is something else.

Outside these pins and points and scaling becoming more realistic - though not yet fully fleshed out in execution - if there is an eth season we'd say it's because the ratio fell too much so it had to rise.

The defi season starts first, and maybe it hasn't reached the level of season, but if the market calms, people might start looking for more yield opportunities, and for some that may well mean converting more fiat as such opportunities increase.

This feeds into eth, which last time fed into NFTs. Some say NFTs have followed the trajectory of bitcoin and eth when they first came out, up then down, while others so memecoins have replaced them, so whether they do have comeback power is to be seen.

The idea of funding art is sound. The problem for centuries has been doing so profitably. How do you monetize vanity? Which in some ways should be an easy question, ask Gucci, but that also means constantly re-inventing and coming up with cool.

Then there's gaming and Web3. The latter is harder, but it solves a real problem: freeing up the commons and the common pen to public ownership from the current 'dictatorship' of one king CEO.

So we've gone from finance, to industry, to art, to tech. Therefore seeing what would be said if there is an eth season is easy, but when there will be one - or god forbid even if - is for the market to tell.

Blockchain gaming is seen as a hot narrative in crypto for 2024 by different industry players, such as Binance and CoinGecko. According to the latter, the total market cap of blockchain gaming tokens is over $18.6 billion.

Delabs Games is one of the players building in this sector, focusing on an ecosystem built on the concept of assets that can be used in different games, called Asset Inventory System.

Joonmo Kwon, founder and CEO at Delabs Games, shared with Crypto Briefing his thoughts on how blockchain technology could revolutionize the gaming industry, how gamers perceive this two-sector junction, and why current traditional titles are not tapping into Web3.

**Crypto Briefing – When it comes to the traditional gaming sector, what are some stark differences you can point out compared to blockchain?**

Joonmo Kwon – One significant difference between Delabs Games and traditional gaming lies in their approach to accessibility and user experience. Delabs Games prioritizes creating fun games for everyone, including Web2 users who may not be familiar with NFTs, wallets, or crypto. Their simple onboarding process allows players to enjoy the benefits of Web3 gaming without needing extensive knowledge of blockchain technology.

In contrast, traditional gaming often lacks the concept of ownership and tangible value for players. While players may invest significant time and money into traditional games, they typically do not retain any tangible assets once the game is no longer supported. Web3 gaming, on the other hand, enables players to own digital assets that are valuable and tradable, providing a sense of ownership and lasting value.

Moreover, the psychological impact of ownership plays a crucial role in Web3 gaming. By owning in-game assets, players become more invested in the game, leading to increased engagement, loyalty, and community participation. This stands in contrast to traditional gaming, where players may feel less connected to the games they play due to the lack of ownership.

Overall, Delabs Games and Web3 gaming represent a shift towards a more sustainable and aligned relationship between game companies and players. By offering more value to players through ownership and participation, Web3 gaming disrupts the traditional gaming industry and creates a model where the interests of both the company and the player are better aligned.

**Crypto Briefing – For a gamer not familiar with the concept of digital assets, can you explain how the Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts their gaming experience?**

A pivotal focus of AIS is its capacity to transition players from solitary game participants to platform users by immersing them in diverse gaming experiences. This is made possible by enabling assets acquired in one game to enhance performance in others. Termed ‘Player Liquidity,’ the objective is to facilitate seamless transitions between games, cultivating a vibrant platform environment.

The Asset Inventory System (AIS) lies at the core of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, offering a gamified platform crafted to facilitate the flow of player liquidity across multiple games on the platform.

AIS motivates users to explore different games through a blend of external rewards and internal satisfaction. Users are driven to gather “assets,” which can be equipped in inventory slots to enrich both their gaming journey and earnings on the platform. This inventive feature adds to the layer’s appeal, encouraging smooth transitions between games and the platform.

The Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts the gaming experience in several ways. The first is enhanced Interoperability and partnership opportunities, as AIS facilitates interoperability between the Delabs Games ecosystem and third-party projects. By suggesting new boosts and set bonuses for assets from third-party projects, the Delabs Games Playable Layer seamlessly introduces new content to platform users. This not only enriches the gaming experience but also opens up opportunities for users to fully explore third-party offerings, ultimately increasing conversion and retention rates.

The second is equipping assets for boost effects, as players can equip assets to their inventory for boost effects both in-game and on the platform. For example, assets like speed boosts in Rumble Racing Star or staking APY boosts can significantly enhance gameplay or earnings. Each asset can possess rarity, boost, and set bonuses, further diversifying the strategies players can employ to optimize their gaming experience.

A third positive impact is collecting assets, since players have various avenues to acquire assets, whether through gameplay, contributions to the platform, or ownership of digital assets within the ecosystem. These earned assets can be equipped in the inventory slots of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, providing players with a range of boost effects that enhance their in-game performance or earnings.

This incentivizes player engagement and participation, enriching the overall gaming experience while fostering a sense of ownership and progression within the ecosystem.

**Crypto Briefing – The gaming industry already has traditional titles that rely heavily upon users’ interactions and could be favored by the AIS concept, such as Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia. Why do you think none of the companies behind these titles started experimenting with that?**

AIS’s core element lies in providing a gamified platform experience. While games like Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia focus primarily on in-game experiences, the Delabs Games Playable Layer extends the gaming experience beyond just gameplay, integrating a platform-native gamified experience. This system allows users to collect and combine various assets for benefits both within individual games and across the platform.

The Delabs Games Playable Layer promotes platform composability, enabling systematic integration across games on the platform. Additionally, by starting with a curated selection of high-quality games and gradually expanding with mini-games, Delabs Games strikes a balance between game quality and accessibility, catering to various intrinsic motivations of gamers.

In contrast, traditional titles may not have experimented with similar concepts because they focus primarily on in-game experiences and may not prioritize the broader platform experience that Delabs Games aims to provide. Delabs Games emphasizes community participation, incentivizing engagement and growth through reward mechanisms and a collaborative mindset rooted in the essence of Web3.

**Crypto Briefing – Blockchain gaming is commonly overlooked by traditional gamers since it involves monetary aspects and NFTs, which are not so popular in this group. From a builder’s perspective, do you see more penetration from blockchain gaming among traditional gamers?**

Yes, there’s a noticeable shift in the perception and adoption of blockchain gaming among traditional gamers. The quality of Web3 games is steadily improving, accompanied by a diversification of genres beyond the casual and puzzle games that previously dominated the space. With expansions into genres like FPS, MMO, and RPGs, blockchain gaming is becoming more appealing to traditional gamers who seek diverse and immersive gaming experiences.

Moreover, major players in the gaming industry, including Nexon and Ubisoft, have announced their entry into Web3 game development, indicating a growing acceptance and interest in blockchain gaming among established gaming companies. Additionally, industry heavyweights like CCP Games, Ubisoft, Square Enix, Sony, and Konami are cautiously exploring the Web3 gaming landscape, further validating the potential of blockchain technology in gaming.

This trend is not limited to established companies; newer entrants like Delabs Games are also venturing into the market, bringing fresh talent and innovation to the forefront. With this influx of talent and investment, blockchain gaming is poised to continue its penetration into the traditional gaming market, offering new games and narratives that appeal to a broader audience.

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38560890/why-bitcoin-might-drop-another-20-10x-research

Published Time: 2024-05-01T13:48:17.000-04:00

Markdown Content:
Crypto research firm **10x Research** on Wednesday underscored its prediction that the ongoing **Bitcoin** BTC/USD correction may take prices into [the low $50,000s.](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38555886/this-trader-sees-bitcoin-dropping-to-40-000-and-still-be-fine-expect-lower-prices-but-dont)

**What Happened**: In their latest email [newsletter](https://10xresearch.co/), the team around lead analyst **Markus Thielen** highlight the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.

Their research suggests the [average entry price](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38277523/bitcoin-halving-jitters-why-10x-research-urges-caution) for U.S. Bitcoin ETF holders sits around $57,300, potentially even higher, a level Bitcoin prices are rapidly approaching.

Despite the predicted correction, 10x Research maintains a positive long-term outlook.

Bitcoin’s recent one-year high validates their early 2023 prediction of a new bull market, further reinforced by its proximity to their forecasted halving price of $63,160.

Additionally, their 2023 year-end target of $45,000 was nearly achieved, and their post-ETF approval target of $57,000, later revised to $70,000, underscores their continuous analysis and adaptation.

Their ability to accurately predict market movements stems from a deep understanding of historical trends and the driving forces within the crypto industry.

As 10x Research points out in their previous reports, analyzing these factors has been instrumental in their successful predictions throughout the current bull market.

**Why It Matters**: Looking back, the August 2023 correction was attributed to rising 10-year Treasury bond yields and a hawkish Fed stance, mirroring the situation during the August 2015 RMB devaluation.

While the initial impact was a sharp decline, Bitcoin ultimately recovered significantly by year-end.

Similar foresight was applied in January 2024, where 10x Research anticipated a correction to $36,000/$38,000, citing the historical tendency for corrections following major Bitcoin product approvals.

They recommended hedging long exposure but turned bullish again as Bitcoin rebounded, reiterating their $70,000 target.

March 2024 saw another crucial turning point.

Recognizing the potential for a +/-10% move, 10x Research established a line in the sand at $68,300, indicating a potential significant top if breached.

This aligns with their current [prediction of a correction](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38334571/why-bitcoin-could-plummet-to-52-000-10x-research) towards $52,000/$55,000 within the ongoing bull market.

Several factors contribute to this anticipated correction.

The research highlights a shift in ETF buying behavior, with six [consecutive days of outflows](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38554103/spot-bitcoin-etfs-bled-another-162-million-on-tuesday) observed.

**What’s Next**: As the average entry price of $57,300 is approached, further ETF unwinding is expected, potentially pushing prices down.

Additionally, the estimated all-in mining cost of $53,000/$55,000 for Bitcoin miners could trigger selling to protect operations.

While a 25% to 29% correction is anticipated, 10x Research acknowledges the possibility of a consolidation period instead of a sharp snapback rally.

As industry leaders gather at events like Benzinga’s [Future of Digital Assets](https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/) on Nov. 19th, insights from 10x Research and other experts will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of the current bull market and preparing for potential corrections within the broader landscape.

Here’s Why Changpeng Zhao Got a Lighter Prison Sentence 
--------------------------------------------------------

The former Binance chief has been sentenced after months of anticipation, but with an element of surprise.

*   **Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to prison.**
*   **The significantly reduced sentence CZ received has raised questions across the industry.** 
*   **Analysts have described the recent ruling as unjust.** 

Former Binance CEO [Changpeng Zhao](https://dailycoin.com/how-binances-changpeng-zhao-became-powerful-man-in-crypto/) and the U.S. Department of Justice have been embroiled in a legal tussle over the past months following his November conviction of violating anti-money laundering laws and facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals. As one of the biggest legal cases to rock the crypto industry, CZ’s conviction resulted in significant sanctions, including a [hefty $4.3 billion](https://dailycoin.com/heres-what-binances-4b-settlement-and-czs-resignation-means/) and his resignation from Binance as CEO. 

Despite the weight of the penalties, Zhao was not let off the hook, and he promised an additional hefty jail time for his conviction. Following [several months of anticipation](https://dailycoin.com/heres-what-changpeng-zhaos-delayed-sentence-means-for-him/) of his sentencing, US Judge Richard Jones finally brought the legal case to a close, albeit with a surprising twist.

CZ’s Shocking Sentence 
-----------------------

Contrasting the promised hefty sentence, Judge Jones [handed](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison-.html) CZ a mere four-month prison term for his guilty plea to violating US anti-money laundering laws.

Justifying the ruling, Judge Jones asserted that the sentence, which mocks the [3-year term recommended by prosecutors](https://dailycoin.com/u-s-doj-asks-changpeng-zhao-cz-to-be-jailed-for-3-years/) and falls below the maximum one to two years under federal laws, is appropriate for the former CEO, citing the lack of evidence that he was “informed” of the illegal activities at the exchange.

Zhao’s conduct and reputation were also focal points in his sentencing. Despite the prosecutor’s argument that he adopted an intentional ‘apology over permission’ approach to circumventing regulations, Judge Jones emphasized that he acted responsibly and displayed a modest nature.

“The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility,” stated the judge, [adding that](https://x.com/martypartymusic/status/1785385750479118774?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) “There needs to be an effort by this court to impose a sentence that’s appropriate and reasonable” 

The perceived attributes, built on Zhao’s apology and over 160 letters from his family seeking leniency, are believed to have influenced Judge Jones’s ruling, resulting in the ousted CEO receiving minimal time for his conviction.

CZ’s reduced jail time has spotlighted its stark contrast from another major legal crypto case in the United States.

How CZ’s Sentence Differs From SBF’s
------------------------------------

The Justice Department’s conviction of Channgpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) in November 2023 marked an eventual history, considering both positions as once-hailed titans of the industry.

However, while CZ’s sentence was a mere four months in jail, SBF [bagged a 25-year term](https://dailycoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-gets-25-years-heres-a-full-breakdown/) on March 28, 2024, raising a debate over the stark difference.

The severity of their charges justifies the variance in their sentencing. Unlike Zhao, whose allegations were solely focused on regulatory violations, SBF was [convicted on several counts of financial fraud](https://dailycoin.com/sbf-guilty-on-multiple-charges-awaits-sentence-in-2024/), including wire and securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  

Additionally, SBF was declared guilty of misappropriating user funds and triggering losses of over $8 billion for the users and the broader industry, a crime not present in the CZ cases. Binance has repeatedly reiterated the safety of users’ funds, providing the exchange and CEO an edge in its regulatory case.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **Changpeng Zhao’s wealth and influence have been** [**spotlighted**](https://twitter.com/jeffhauser/status/1785419246316474486?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) **as another reason for his reduced term.**
*   **One of the allegations against Binance was the facilitation of illicit transactions for terrorist organizations, and analysts have** [**decried his light sentence**](https://twitter.com/bettermarkets/status/1785390499076964742?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) **as a miscarriage of justice.**
*   **Although the sentence ended his legal battles, the former CEO could still not return to the exchange, as his** [**November ousting**](https://dailycoin.com/binance-will-be-fine-cz-pens-final-note-to-staff-as-ceo/) **was final.**

Why This Matters
----------------

A mere 120-day sentence for Changpeng Zhao constitutes a win for him by letting him off the hook easily, considering the severity of the charges for which he was convicted and the rather stringent approach the DOJ is renowned for.

*   Rootstock's new plan to bring programmability to Bitcoin could unfold over the next 12 months.

*   The project could lead to the development of layer-2 networks atop Bitcoin without requiring any major changes to the blockchain's underlying code.

*   Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine developer known for his early work on Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin stash, discussed the project Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ developer conference in Austin.


AUSTIN, TEXAS — The founder of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol [Rootstock](https://rootstock.io/) has detailed plans for a new "BitVMX" project designed to improve the oldest blockchain's programmability by keying off developer Robin Linus's much-discussed "[BitVM](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/13/bitcoin-researcher-behind-bitvm-ignites-fresh-buzz-with-new-paper-on-file-hosting/)" design unveiled last year.

Sergio Demian Lerner, a Buenos Aires-based programmer known for his early research on Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's mining activities and later for contributing to the Ethereum blockchain's development, discussed the project onstage Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ conference in Austin, Texas.

"We have a roadmap to finish this in one year" and "we are moving forward at full speed," Lerner said during the presentation.

Linus's [release of BitVM last year](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/11/bitcoin-might-get-ethereum-style-smart-contracts-under-bitvm-plan/) has been widely cited by Bitcoin developers as a breakthrough for the 15-year-old blockchain since it theoretically would facilitate the development of programmable layer-2 networks similar to those that are being used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to make transactions cheaper and faster. Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code – seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades.

Lerner had disclosed last month during an exclusive interview last week on CoinDesk's [The Protocol podcast](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-protocol/rootstock-bringing-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-bitcoin/) that he was working with colleagues on the new project without providing details.

Last week, Rootstock Labs published a [blog post](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/content-hub/announcing-bitvmx-an-advanced-computational-layer-for-bitcoin/) on the effort, arguing that "theory and practice are two very different things," referring to Linus's original concept.

"The BitVMX research team intends to build on this initial discovery with additional innovations to create an improved development framework for running programs on Bitcoin," according to the blog post. "The name is a nod to BitVMX’s origins while highlighting its focus on extending Bitcoin and accelerating the development of the next generation of sidechains and layer 2s."

Rootstock Labs added that "a team of core contributors is working on a public roadmap of proposed improvements to the network in the next 12 months."

According to an accompanying [whitepaper](https://bitvmx.org/), "BitVMX framework provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compilation toolchain" – a technical description of the new system that boils down to facilitating a "myriad of use cases."

Two figures once considered to be titans in the crypto industry are going to prison in the United States for drastically different amounts of time.

Since the sentencing hearings for former FTX CEO [Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/sam-bankman-fried-and-caroline-ellison) and former Binance CEO [Changpeng “CZ” Zhao](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/changpeng-zhao), many in and out of the crypto space have questioned why the two industry leaders have received such different treatment in the U.S. legal system. Bankman-Fried could be in his fifties by the time he leaves prison and will likely have fewer assets than Zhao, who will be out of prison by the end of the year and, according to Forbes, has an estimated net worth of $33 billion.

But let’s back up a minute.

Bankman-Fried was arrested in 2022, extradited to the United States, pleaded not guilty, given house arrest, remanded to jail after allegations of witness intimidation, prosecuted in a six-week trial, found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Zhao was charged in 2023, pleaded guilty, was allowed to remain free on bail, was sentenced to four months in prison and will surrender himself in a matter of days.

The former FTX CEO faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misuse of customer funds. CZ faced one charge related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.

“CZ was charged with a crime that is more akin to a regulatory violation: the failure to have an adequate system of Anti-Money Laundering controls, while SBF was charged with wire fraud in connection with the secret plundering of billions of dollars in crypto custody with FTX to prop up Alameda,” Mark Bini, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While both \[crimes\] are serious, SBF’s crime was far more serious.” ![Image 1: two men shaking hands in front of a t shirt](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/edece203-846c-4f01-93d8-b3e61930dfb8.png)

From the beginning of his legal woes, Bankman-Fried and his defense team have largely maintained that he “did what \[he\] thought was right.” In the sentencing hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan accused the former FTX CEO of lying on the stand and [described his testimony](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-years-prison-hold) as “evasive.” His first interview after the judge laid down a 25-year judgment [included SBF saying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-post-sentencing-statement): “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal.”

The facts of the case presented at trial also undermined SBF’s defense. Many government witnesses, including his former girlfriend and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, [suggested that he orchestrated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/caroline-ellison-testifies-sam-bankman-fried-trial) the misuse of FTX user funds.

In contrast, Zhao did not publicly comment on the case between U.S. authorities and Binance [since a $4.3 billion settlement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-officials-announce-binance-settlement) and his guilty plea in November 2023. He submitted hundreds of pages worth of letters from industry leaders, family members and others. Judge Richard Jones [commented on the outpouring](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-binance-sentenced-prison) of support for CZ at his sentencing hearing, adding he had “risked \[his\] entire net worth” for Binance. “Even though I believe he was guilty of much more, the DOJ didn’t have the evidence, and that’s why they could only get CZ to admit to rather light crimes,” Swan Bitcoin managing Director Terrence Yang told Cointelegraph. “Unlike SBF, \[...\] CZ didn’t fight extradition (was in a non-extradition country) and agreed to only light crimes in his plea deal. CZ is only paying $50 million in his plea deal with the DOJ.” ![Image 2: peter hahn tweets a picture of a man and a woman](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/dcf191b6-558f-4ca6-9278-e69dd9e843e7.png)

Despite speculation from many crypto users, it is doubtful that CZ and SBF will share a cell while incarcerated, let alone be housed in the same facility. Though the judge in SBF’s case suggested that he would serve in a San Francisco Bay Area prison, he may also allow the former FTX CEO to [stay in New York](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prison-appeal) during his appeal.

Dubai's crypto-friendly policies and infrastructure fuel its rise as a global innovation hub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOKEN2049, a global conference series for the crypto industry, concluded its inaugural Dubai event with resounding success despite facing unprecedented weather challenges. The conference, which took place from April 18-19 during TOKEN2049 Week, attracted a record-breaking 10,000 attendees from over 160 countries.

Torrential rains, the heaviest in the UAE’s recorded history, threatened to disrupt the event. However, the crypto community’s resilience shone through as attendees braved the elements to participate in the sold-out conference.

&gt; “This week we witnessed the determination of the crypto industry first hand,” said Alex Fiskum, Co-Founder of TOKEN2049. “Our programme proceeded and our doors opened as planned, welcoming attendees to a comfortable, immersive, and action-packed event.”

TOKEN2049 Dubai featured an impressive lineup of over 200 industry leaders, including Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram; Richard Teng, CEO of Binance; Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether; and Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder of BitMEX.

The event was marked by significant announcements, such as Tether’s partnership with Telegram to launch USDT on The Open Network (TON), Polkadot’s introduction of a new JAM chain graypaper, Berachain’s collaboration with Google Cloud, and Telos’ partnership with Ponos Technology to develop an Ethereum L2 zkEVM network.

Looking ahead, TOKEN2049 Singapore is set to raise the bar even higher, with an expected 20,000 attendees converging at the iconic Marina Bay Sands on September 18-19, just before the Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend.

&gt; “Energized by this success, we now shift focus to prepare for the industry’s largest event of the year,” Fiskum stated.

Bitcoin has pulled back 22% from its all-time high in March. Now, on-chain intelligence company Glassnode suggests the market could be “hammering out a local bottom formation.” 

In a new [report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-18-2024/), the firm suggests that the market is currently still in a “euphoria” phase—a period in a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin. When investors are in this state, the market should expect a correction.

With [Bitcoin crashing to $57,000](https://decrypt.co/228938/bitcoin-crashes-to-57000-and-ethereum-slips-below-3000-hours-before-fed-meeting) at the time of writing, many investors believe we’re currently experiencing such a correction. But how much further will this drawback go?

Glassnode said that a good way to identify whether we've reached the local bottom is when short-term investors realize losses. Its historical data shows numerous examples from 2020 until now that show when one-week to one-month-old entities realize losses, Bitcoin’s price often begins to climb shortly after.

Carlos Mercado, data scientist at analytics company Flipside Crypto, told _Decrypt_, “I'm inclined to believe Glassnode is correctly identifying the ‘paper hands’ phenomenon within a specific cohort.”

“Paper hand” investors leave the market at the highest rate when the market is reaching its bottom. As long as the [market-value-to-realized-value](https://academy.glassnode.com/market/mvrv/mvrv-ratio) (MVRV) ratio—a measure of an asset's market cap versus the value stored in the asset—remains between 1.0 and 0.9, it has a chance to bounce back.

Fortunately, the market is within this band, providing hope that it can rebound.

“It could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation,” the report explained. “That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.”

Since the publication of this report, the price of BTC has continued to slide from $66,700 down to $57,000. Is this the beginning of the paper-hands sell-off that the report predicts? Or will it go lower?

“Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday, the closest consolidation to the current price level was in the $50,000 to $52,000 area,” senior market analyst at [FxPro](https://www.fxpro.com/) Alex Kuptsikevich explained to _Decrypt._

“A more dramatic scenario suggests a pullback to the $40,000 to $44,000 area, which would shake the weak hands out of the market before we get sustained interest from new buyers,” Kuptsikevich added.

URL Source: https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-recovers-after-fed-announces-no-rate-hike-at-fomc/

The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate of 5.25%% to 5.5% at the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Wednesday, following a fearsome 6% drawdown in Bitcoin’s price earlier that day.

Within five minutes of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price rose from $57,300 to $57,700

*   Per a [press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm), the central bank said it also plans to slow down the rate at which it sells US Treasury securities starting in June, reducing its monthly redemption cap from $60 billion to $25 billion.
*   Market participants [overwhelmingly expected](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) the Fed to maintain its interest rate at 5.25% heading into the meeting, expecting cuts to potentially take off in Q4.
*   However, words from the central bank confirmed market fears that the central bank may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell nationwide price inflation, which remains stubbornly above 3%.
*   “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” the Fed wrote.
*   The economy also remains surprisingly resilient: data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that 81% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have filed their Q1 earnings have beaten their first-quarter expectations.
*   Bitcoin’s price is known to be influenced by central bank policy and macroeconomic liquidity conditions.  
Some analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe BTC will continue to [surge past](https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-bitcoin-btc-will-not-stop-at-100k-arthur-hayes-live-from-token2049/) $100,000 as central bank balance sheets continue to expand.

*   **Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose.**
*   **This comes as crypto traders lose $400M following Bitcoin’s crash to $56K.**
*   **Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s long-term outperformance compared to traditional assets.**

While crypto investors shoulder substantial losses over the past day amid the market retracement, renowned [Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor](https://coinedition.com/michael-saylors-bitcoin-leveraged-strategy-transforming-1-income-to-400m-profit/) took to X to reassure enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains the essential asset they cannot afford to overlook. In his words, “Bitcoin is for the money you can’t afford to lose.”

Saylor’s commentary comes amid Bitcoin’s price correction in the past few days, culminating in the asset revisiting the $56K range. At the press time value of $57,568, BTC is trading at one of its lowest points in the two months.

Following the asset’s substantial crash in the last few hours, at least 141K crypto traders who had placed bets on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory have been liquidated, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million. Nonetheless, Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, remains confident that this downturn should be less concerning for Bitcoin investors.

The short video accompanying Saylor’s tweet illustrated Bitcoin’s performance over the past eight years compared to various traditional investments, including the S&amp;P 500, Gold, U.S. real estate, U.S. dollar, Nigerian Naira, Turkish Lira, and Argentine Peso.

It depicted that while Bitcoin maintained an over 100% gain year-on-year since 2016, these other investments struggled to attain comparable returns.

For instance, in 2019, Gold and U.S. real estate saw significant gains of around 20%. However, these gains gradually diminished over the years to single-digit percentages. At the same time, currencies like the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso experienced crashes, plummeting to as low as 0.001%.

These outcomes have solidified Saylor’s belief that Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose. Responding to Saylor’s sentiment, X user AfriBull [remarked](https://x.com/Afri_bull/status/1785439846745493906), “Bitcoin has become the ultimate hedge against fiat volatility globally.”

As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.25-5.50%.

Also pretty much as expected, [the FOMC acknowledged](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm) that progress on lower inflation has stalled this year and said it wouldn't be appropriate to trim rates until it has greater confidence inflation is moving "sustainably" towards 2%.

CZ's 4-Month Sentence Seems 'Minimal' for the Crime Committed: Legal Expert


The price of bitcoin [(BTC)](https://coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"BitcoinPrice|BTCPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") has bounced modestly in the minutes since the news hit, but remains under pressure, down more than 4% for the session at $58,000.

In addition to the rate news, the FOMC announced it is slowing the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. Other things being equal, the move is likely to boost risk appetite and asset prices, wrote economist Joseph Brusuelas.

Markets came into 2024 expecting a long series of rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, but those hopes have been whittled down sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to show strength and inflation has actually risen a bit in the year's first four months. According [the CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing in a nearly 25% chance of zero rate cuts this year. One month ago, there was just a 1% chance of no Fed easing in 2024.

That change in expectations has weighed a bit on traditional markets, with the Nasdaq lower by about 5% since hitting its 2024 high about three weeks ago and the S&amp;P 500 off by a similar amount since touching its year-to-date high in late March. It's also likely contributed to the plunging bitcoin price, which is now down more than 20% from its record high from mid-March above $73,000.

A check of traditional markets shortly after the FOMC announcement, finds stocks remaining little-changed and the dollar and bond yields slightly lower. Gold is up 0.5% at $2,316 per ounce but remains about 4% down from its record high above $2,400 hit in mid-April.

Further clues to the Fed's thinking will come shortly as Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m ET.

Digital securities platform Securitize has raised $47 million in a new strategic funding round led by BlackRock. Blockchain developers Aptos Labs and Paxos, and stablecoin issuer Circle, were also among the investors.

Proceeds from the funding round will be used for product development, global expansion and strengthening partnerships in the financial services ecosystem, Securitize [said](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/securitize-announces-47-million-strategic-funding-round-led-by-blackrock-302133075.html) in a statement.

BlackRock global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom will join the Securitize board of directors. Chalom called the investment in Securitize “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy \[…\] that will help meet the future needs of our clients." ![Image 2: a twittee with the words'security' and confetti](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/9e8955bd-4bc7-4ed4-944b-69b0f0d20a5e.png)

Securitize partnered with BlackRock as a transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent on the March launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first tokenized fund.

BUIDL invests in cash, United States Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, and pays dividends accrued daily through a monthly deposit of tokens stably worth $1. BUIDL holders have the option to transfer their shares to Circle in exchange for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)) stablecoin.

In the six weeks of its existence, BUIDL amassed a market cap of $375 million to become the largest tokenized treasury fund, surpassing the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI) by $7 million. There is currently $1.28 billion locked in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, [according](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries) to RWA.xyz.

**_Related: [Securitize issues tokenized assets in Spain, plans September trading start](https://cointelegraph.com/news/securitize-issues-tokenized-assets-in-spain-plans-september-trading-start)_**

Investment manager Hamilton Lane, which has worked with Securitize since 2022, also contributed to the fundraise, along with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. Aptos Labs co-founder and CEO Mo Shaikh told Cointelegraph:

&gt; “Aptos Labs is \[…\] a key participant in closing the gap between traditional finance and open finance in a very real and globally accessible way. With leaders like BlackRock and pioneers like Securitize at the helm, there’s no doubt that a significant piece of the future of finance will play out onchain.” Securitize is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as broker-dealer and transfer agent and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) self-regulatory organization. **_Magazine: [Crypto City: Guide to San Francisco Bay Area](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-city-guide-san-francisco-bay-area/)_**

CoinGlass [reported](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) that over $421 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with over $349 million of these liquidated future positions being long. Being long on an asset means betting that its price will go up, while being short on it means betting that it will go down.

Markus Thielen, CEO and head analyst of 10x Research, believes that Bitcoin may drop to $52,000. “The primary driver for the recent Bitcoin price rally was the inflow of funds into Bitcoin ETFs, which has now dried up over the past 4-5 weeks. The market internals have become weaker,” he said in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thielen10x/status/1785454835191701566) on X.

Wall Street awaits Fed rate decision
------------------------------------

Stock markets slipped on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision.

Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 market index decreased by 0.51%, while Nasdaq 100 futures saw a drop of 0.82%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also experienced a decline of 0.26%.

MicroStrategy (MSTR), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw a 5% drop. Coinbase (COIN), a major cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a 3.5% loss.

Mining stocks continue to be pummeled. Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) saw their share values fall by 3.2% and 3.5%, respectively.

The U.S. central bank will release its rate policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, following which Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong debut of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs didn't make a big splash on their first day, with a trading volume of just over $11 million.

Yet, considering the relatively smaller size of the Hong Kong ETF market compared to the U.S., ETF analyst Eric Balchunas [noted](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1785283076802707563) that the debut was more successful than perceived."If you localize numbers, this was big," Balchunas said.

The Federal Reserve Wednesday elected to keep its key interest rate steady as the central bank’s focus on fighting inflation compounded pain in the crypto market.

In his typically cautious tone, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% was difficult but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”

“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”

He would not reveal to reporters when there would be a rate cut.

“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell added in a prepared statement.

As of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 4.6% and 1.3% over the past day to $57,600 and $2,945, respectively, according to [CoinGecko](https://decrypt.co/degen-alley). Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen slightly throughout the trading day.

But while the daily shift is broadly downward, both [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) and [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) have marked slight increases over the past hour, including ahead of and since the rate announcement. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past hour, while Ethereum has perked up by 2% during the same span.

If you think the recent dips in the price of Bitcoin is bad, leading financial firm Standard Chartered could further darken your mood, concluding that the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap could fall as far as $50,000. In a Wednesday note, Geoffrey Kendrick—digital assets researcher at the British company and lead author of the report—said that “the broader macro backdrop has deteriorated for assets like crypto that thrive on liquidity.” “The driver seems to be a combination of crypto specifi...

Signs of stubborn inflation have lent traders pause, as [fears boiled over](https://decrypt.co/227213/bitcoin-bull-run-halving-etfs-experts-weigh-in) last month that the Fed could be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Those jitters were elevated recently by a stronger-than-expected [rise in inflation](https://decrypt.co/228113/bitcoin-ethereum-gdp-fed-rate-cuts-inflation) and [growth in wages](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-labor-costs-increase-more-than-expected-first-quarter-2024-04-30/) in the first quarter.

Shifting rate expectations are driving Bitcoin’s price more as spot Bitcoin ETFs see [pittering inflows](https://decrypt.co/228620/digital-asset-investment-funds-lose-cash-three-weeks?amp=1), CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill told _Decrypt_ Monday. For Ethereum, the pressure comes as a [court battle](https://decrypt.co/228274/coinbase-uniswap-ethereum-consensys-sec) over its regulatory status in the U.S. [continues](https://decrypt.co/228870/sec-gensler-lied-congress-ethereum-patrick-mchenry) to come to light.

Inflation has fallen steadily from multi-decade highs in 2022, but it remains above the Fed’s target of 2% annually. When inflation clocked in at 3.5% in the 12 months through March, a lack of change compared to the previous month’s release caused crypto markets to [shudder immediately](https://decrypt.co/225622/bitcoin-ethereum-dive-us-inflation-data).

The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a target range of between 5.25% and 5.5% since July of last year, pushing forward for months with the highest rates in more than 23 years.

[Feds Are Investigating Jack Dorsey's Block Over Bitcoin Biz: Report](https://decrypt.co/229047/feds-investigating-jack-dorsey-block-bitcoin-biz-report)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amid an apparently growing crackdown on the crypto industry from American regulators, U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Block, the Jack Dorsey-founded company behind Square and Cash App. Federal prosecutors have been probing the internal processes of the company—including its crypto business—according to a report from NBC News published Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors are reportedly investigating "alleged widespread and yearslong compliance...

Higher interest rates, which can slow the economy through increased borrowing costs, are generally bad news for risk assets like stocks and crypto. That’s because the payout on cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries becomes relatively more attractive as rates move and stay higher.

Though the Fed in March had [penciled in](https://decrypt.co/222627/bitcoin-price-barely-budges-federal-reserve-interest-rates) three quarter-percentage point cuts for 2024, traders have grown less hopeful. According to the CME’s [FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), financial market participants may see only one rate cute—or zero—by year’s end.

As rate cut expectations inched further out in April, Bitcoin notched its worst month since November 2022. Coming off all-time highs in March, Bitcoin fell 14% throughout the month to around $60,000.

In April, Powell [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fed-chair-powell-says-lack-progress-year-inflation-rcna148075) that inflation hasn’t come down as quickly as policymakers expected, suggesting rate cuts could still be far out. Yet the Fed chair signaled interest rates, where they currently are, could also be sufficient to get the job done too.

“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” he said. “That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.”

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/bitcoin-jumps-dxy-falls-as-fed-to-reduce-bond-selling

Markdown Content:
The Federal Reserve Banks are slowing down the quantitative tightening (QT) by lowering the rate of bond selling.

"Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion," it [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240501a1.pdf), adding:

"The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities."

They will also keep interest rates at current levels until the next meeting in June as they wait for inflation to move to 2%.

The reduction by more than 50% in bond selling every month, combined with an announcement by the Treasury of a bonds buyback plan, should lower the yield with it dropping 45 basis points on this announcement for the 10 year Treasuries.

Lower bond yields should reduce the cost of debt overall, making this a soft rate cut ahead of the [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0unztmcLvA) by Fed's chair Jerome Powell when we'll learn more.

Bitcoin rose above $58,000 from $57,000 on the announcement while a volatile dollar index, DXY, dipped to 105.7 initially, to now 105.8 from 105.9.

No strong directional move yet therefore ahead of the conference as markets digest this announcement.

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/federal-reserve-holds-interest-rates-level

Markdown Content:
In a highly anticipated move, the Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates at their existing level on Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee two-day policy meeting. 

The rate hike pause marks the central bank’s sixth since consecutively raising interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023. Persistent inflation and a healthy labor market contributed to central bankers’ decision to hold rates, they said. 

“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” Wednesday’s [statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240501a1.pdf) read. “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” 

Central bankers will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting rates, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday during a press conference.

“The path forward is uncertain,” [Powell](https://blockworks.co/tag/jerome-powell) said. 

“Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,” he added.

Stocks and cryptocurrencies were little changed on the news. Bitcoin ([BTC](https://blockworks.co/price/btc)) traded sideways in the moments after the [Fed](https://blockworks.co/tag/federal-reserve) released its statement at 2 pm ET, sitting around $57,786 at time of publication, per Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. 

Ether ([ETH](https://blockworks.co/price/eth)) similarly traded flat, hovering around $2,900 at time of publication – about 1% lower over 24 hours. 

The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes inched marginally higher on the news, managing to move just barely into the green after an otherwise disappointing trading session. 

Bitcoin has hovered below $60,000 since early Wednesday, a downward trend analysts say is poised to continue. 

“A break to the downside through $59,200 in BTC has led to an accelerated selloff and, barring an unforeseen catalyst, there seems little in the way of this market testing the \[$53,000\] area before a meaningful turnaround,” Mike Tauckus, head of trading and structuring at BitOoda, said. Markets on Wednesday expected about a 9% chance a rate cut will come in June, according to [data](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) from CME Group.

URL Source: https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/aave-proposes-v4-iteration-and-aave-network-validium

Published Time: 2024-05-01T19:00:00.000Z

Markdown Content:
Aave v4 will aggregate liquidity from multiple networks via a cross-chain liquidity layer.

Aave, the largest DeFi lending protocol by TVL, has proposed plans to launch a v4 iteration and validium network within the next three years.

Announced on May 1, Aave v4 will boast a unified cross-chain liquidity layer (CCLL), aggregating liquidity from across multiple networks within a single protocol. Aave noted that CCLL would be powered by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which completed its [permissionless rollout](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/chainlink-completes-permissionless-rollout-for-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol) last week.

“Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol,” the proposal said. “This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks.”

Aave v4 will also feature automated adjustments to its interest rate curve, dynamic interest rate premiums for riskier assets, smart accounts and vaults allowing users to segregate their borrowing activities, and an updated liquidation engine.

Aave said it hopes to begin prototyping its v4 protocol during Q4 and hopes to implement the code in Q2 2025. However, it does not expect the CCLL to roll out until 2026 or 2027.

The proposal also outlines plans to launch an Aave Network, which would function as the primary hub for the Aave protocol and the project’s GHO stablecoin.

Aave proposes utilizing a rollup-like [validium](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/vitalik-advocates-for-renewed-exploration-into-plasma-based-scaling-solutions) architecture for the network, adopting GHO as its network token for fees, and using AAVE as the main staking asset for decentralized validators and sequencers.

Aave noted it will monitor the evolution of both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks before finalizing the network’s architecture, but said Aave Network will inherit its security from Ethereum.

The proposal added that “Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance” and both Aave and GHO would continue to operate as “multichain and network-agnostic despite Aave’s plans to launch a bespoke network. Aave is also targeting 2026 or 2027 for the launch of Aave Chain.

Aave seeks to ensure future dominance
-------------------------------------

Aave is the third-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of $10 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

Recent research from Token Terminal indicated that Aave has consistently enjoyed a roughly [50%](https://twitter.com/tokenterminal/status/1759210742035746890/photo/1) share of the DeFi lending market over the past three years. Aave’s Marc Zeller [replied](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1759229791637524957) that roughly 75% of the value in DeFi lending protocols is locked in projects leveraging versions of Aave’s codebase.

Aave said its three-year plan seeks to maintain its position as a leading DeFi for the rest of the decade. “These ideas aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users,” the proposal said.

Aave’s three-year roadmap also includes promoting the development of real-world asset products built around GHO, expanding Aave onto networks that do not support Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, and introducing new visual branding licensed to the Aave DAO.

Aave is budgeting 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE ($2.1 million) to complete the first year of the roadmap, with the DAO providing 3M GHO upfront and streaming the remaining assets over the course of the first 12 months.

The price of AAVE is down 14% over the past week amid the recent digital asset downturn, according to CoinGecko. Aave noted that more than 450,000 wallets currently hold AAVE.

**Ladan Stewart, a former key figure at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has publicly refuted claims suggesting a governmental agenda against crypto.** 

She emphasizes that the regulatory body’s actions never aimed to stifle innovation in the nascent industry.

Cryptos Will Not Be Eliminated in the US
----------------------------------------

Stewart, now a partner at White &amp; Case LLP, [explained](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/05/01/former-top-sec-litigator-says-theres-no-systematic-plan-to-kill-crypto/?sh=13bf4efd4413) that during her tenure at the SEC, her primary focus was on litigating high-profile cases such as those against [Ripple](https://beincrypto.com/ripple-opposes-secs-fine-xrp-lawsuit/) and [Coinbase](https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-sec-hearing-underwhelming-crypto-lawyer/). She pointed out that the agency’s approach has always been technologically neutral.

Therefore, she clarified the widespread speculation about a deliberate crackdown the SEC has imposed on crypto businesses.

&gt; “The SEC is not trying to kill crypto. Our main concern has always been about ensuring investor protection and compliance within the industry,” Stewart stated.

According to Stewart, the industry’s compliance with regulations designed to protect investors is critical. The SEC’s efforts constantly ensure that investors have all the detailed information. While the [SEC will continue to enforce compliance](https://beincrypto.com/gary-gensler-misled-congress-ethereum/), there is no conspiracy to dismantle the crypto industry. 

Instead, the focus is on fostering a safe and compliant environment for investors. Which, in turn, supports the healthy growth of the sector.

In her view, open dialogue and [cooperation between regulators and the crypto community](https://beincrypto.com/sec-blackrock-spot-ethereum-etf-comments/) are essential for resolving ongoing tensions. Stewart’s insights underline a significant shift in regulatory strategies, focusing on education and compliance rather than restriction.

As someone who has transitioned from a governmental role to a private legal practice, Stewart aims to bridge the gap between the crypto industry and regulatory frameworks. Her new role involves guiding crypto businesses through the complex landscape of US regulations, striving for a balance that respects innovation and legal compliance.

Artificial intelligence can rapidly scan the massive Bitcoin blockchain for signs of illegal activity, a capability that could dramatically strengthen the work of law enforcement in combatting money laundering, a new [report](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai?utm_content=291576989&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-1344645140) explains.

Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic on Wednesday published a study with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab that analyzed Bitcoin transactions using a deep learning AI model to detect money laundering patterns and identify wallets used in crimes.

[Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) is renowned for using a decentralized public ledger—a core facet of the technology that also made the study possible, Elliptic said. Elliptic and MIT-IBM used AI to separate legal and illicit transactions into groups and follow links among the latter to uncover potential money laundering.

“Blockchains provide fertile ground for machine learning techniques, thanks to the availability of both transaction data and information on the types of entities that are transacting, collected by us and others,” Elliptic wrote. “This is in contrast to traditional finance where transaction data is typically siloed, making it challenging to apply these techniques.”

The test was not attempted with so-called “[privacy coins](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-privacy-coins-monero-zcash-and-dash-explained).”

[Did Law Enforcement Crack Privacy Coin Monero? It's Complicated](https://decrypt.co/214367/did-law-enforcement-crack-privacy-coin-monero-its-complicated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier this week, an article in Finnish publication MTV Uutiset claimed that Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP) had succeeded in tracking transactions made using the privacy preserving cryptocurrency Monero. However, it's unlikely that Monero itself has been compromised, a former member of the MAGIC Monero Fund committee told Decrypt. Csilla Brimer said that investigators were likely able to trace some transactions because of faulty operational security on the part of users, rathe...

“Counterparty information is available for all transactions \[on Bitcoin\],” Elliptic co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom Robinson told _Decrypt_, adding that the technique could be applied to other open blockchains like [Solana](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps) and [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide). “This isn’t the case for privacy coins such as Monero.”

&gt; New Elliptic research released today explores how [#AI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) can be leveraged to detect money laundering and other financial crime on the blockchain. The research applies new techniques to a dataset containing 200m+ transactions, which is now publicly available. [https://t.co/k3GdjWJ08P](https://t.co/k3GdjWJ08P)

“Rather than identifying transactions made by illicit actors, a machine learning model is trained to identify ‘subgraphs,’ chains of transactions that represent Bitcoin being laundered,” Elliptic explained. “This approach allows us to focus on the ‘multi-hop’ laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors.”

According to Elliptic, the report published today continues work that the company began with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in 2019. Elliptic initially worked with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange to test their theory.

“Of 52 ‘money laundering’ subgraphs predicted by the model \[that\] ended with deposits to this exchange, the exchange confirmed that 14 had been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to money laundering,” the report said. “On average, less than one in 10,000 of these accounts are flagged as such, suggesting that the model performs very well.” [Crypto Exchange KuCoin Charged With 'Multi-Billion Dollar Criminal Conspiracy'](https://decrypt.co/223465/crypto-exchange-kucoin-charged-multi-billion-criminal-conspiracy)

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin and two of its founders were charged Tuesday by the United States Department of Justice with conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to operate a compliant anti-money laundering program. As a result, they allegedly enabled money laundering and terrorist activity to funnel through the platform. "As alleged, in failing to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies, the defendants allowed KuCoin to operate in the shadows of the financial markets...

Government regulators, particularly in the United States, have used money laundering laws as one of many cudgels to attack the cryptocurrency industry. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge in Seattle sentenced Binance founder [Changpeng “CZ” Zhao](https://decrypt.co/228674/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentence-money-laundering) to four months in federal prison for money laundering violations.

Last month, the founders of the Bitcoin mixer [Samourai Wallet](https://decrypt.co/227949/feds-arrest-founders-bitcoin-mixer-samourai-wallet) were arrested on charges of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice.

In the indictment, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said “threat actors” use technology like Samourai Wallet to evade law enforcement detection and create environments conducive to criminal activity.

“While offering Samourai as a ‘privacy’ service, the defendants knew that it was a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion,” the DOJ said in the indictment. ”Indeed, as the defendants intended and well knew, a substantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal proceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment.”

Markdown Content:
As expected, the FED left interest rates constant. In the statement published after the decision, it was stated that there have been deficiencies in reaching the 2% inflation target in the recent period.

Now, FED President Jerome Powell's press conference, which started at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3), is being followed closely.

As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are bringing you this conversation live. You can access Jerome Powell's latest remarks by refreshing the page. You can also find the official live broadcast link right below.

*   Inflation fell significantly last year but remains very high.
*   Further progress on inflation is not guaranteed; The path is unclear.
*   We are extremely careful about inflation risks.
*   The restrictive policy stance put downward pressure on inflation and the economy.
*   Risks to achieving bilateral goals have become better balanced in the past year.
*   The labor market remains relatively tight.
*   Nominal wage growth has decreased over the past year, but labor demand still exceeds supply.
*   This year's inflation data was higher than expected.
*   Our policy actions are guided by our goals.
*   FED officials are 'very aware' of the challenges posed by high inflation.
*   But long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
*   We do not think it would be appropriate to cut interest rates until we have greater confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
*   Gaining greater confidence is likely to take longer than previously expected.
*   Lowering policy too soon or too much, or too late or too little, both have risks.
*   Inflation data so far this year have not given us any more confidence.
*   Politics is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face.
*   We will make our decisions separately for each meeting.
*   The policy rate is at a restrictive level.
*   We believe it will be restrictive enough over time.
*   We believe that over time the policy is restrictive enough to reduce inflation to 2%.
*   The next policy move is unlikely to be a rate hike.
*   We are focused on how long to keep the policy restrictive.
*   To raise rates, we need to see evidence that the policy is not enough to bring inflation back to our target.
*   We think policy is well placed to consider the different paths the economy can take.
*   If inflation is more persistent and the labor market remains strong, it may be appropriate to postpone interest rate cuts.
*   But there are other avenues that point to a rate cut, but these would only come if we gain more confidence and there is an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
*   There is no obvious link between easing financial conditions and inflation.
*   I'm not ruling out that we could still have strong growth or that the labor market and inflation could continue to fall.
*   It is unlikely that the next move will be a rate hike.
*   To meet the inflation target, we will likely need to see wage growth slow to more sustainable levels.
*   I don't know how long it will take us to lower interest rates.
*   Powell: (when asked about 3 interest rate cuts this year) said only that the FED needs more confidence on inflation and does not see progress in Q1.
*   We need to take a cue from three worse-than-expected inflation data.
*   Once we gain confidence about inflation, interest rate cuts will be within scope.
*   The indication we are getting is that it will take longer to get on a sustainable path towards 2% inflation.
*   My expectation is that inflation will decline again this year.
*   My confidence that inflation will decline again is lower than before.
*   Question: Has the possibility of a rate cut decreased this year? Powell: I don't have a probability estimate. We need to be more confident, our confidence did not increase in the first quarter, on the contrary it will last longer than expected.
*   I don't know if inflation will drop enough to merit interest rate cuts.
*   I'm not sure whether there will be a rate cut this year or not.
*   In light of the data we have, I really don't understand where the talk of a stagflation scenario comes from.
*   I don't see stagflation related to growth or inflation.
*   3% inflation does not satisfy us.
*   Restrictive monetary policy needs more time to fulfill its duty.
*   We have peace of mind that we will do what we think is right, when we think it is right.
*   We've seen pretty consistent progress in slowing wage growth, but it's been bumpy.
*   It will take some time, but we will reduce inflation to 2%.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded modestly in the minutes since the news broke, but remains under pressure, falling more than 4% to $58,000 in 24 hours.

Markets entered 2024 expecting a long series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but those hopes have faded sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rose slightly in the first four months of the year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing the probability of a zero rate cut this year at around 25%. A month ago, the probability that the FED would not cut interest rates in 2024 was only 1%.

However, following the decision, many investors predict that the FED will make the only interest rate cut this year in November.

Venture capital is seeing a strong comeback in the gaming industry, with a surge in both funding and deal volume. 

[According](https://www.konvoy.vc/content/gaming-industry-report-q1-2024) to Konvoy Ventures, a venture capital firm specializing in the video gaming industry, the first quarter of 2024 saw $594 million in gaming VC funding, marking a 94% increase from the previous quarter. Deal volume also rose 28%, with 124 deals completed.

Konvoy predicts the gaming market is projected to reach $225 billion by 2029, from $189 billion in 2023.

The Web3 industry is also being driven by blockchain games. According to DappRadar, Web3 games accounted for 30% of all DApp activity in the first quarter of 2024, attracting 2.1 million active wallets every day. During the quarter, Polygon drew in over 1.1 million new wallets, an increase of 429% from the quarter before.

Venture capital firms are gearing up to keep pace with the bull cycle. In April, some of the VCs raising capital for funds included Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm and Pantera Capital.

Early crypto investor Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ has been [charged with a tax fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud), with the Department of Justice saying he evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.

In an indictment filed in federal court in Los Angeles, 45-year-old Ver is charged with mail fraud and tax evasion. The DOJ stated that the indictment was unsealed after his arrest in Spain over the weekend, and the U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.

Ver earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” due to his early investments in cryptocurrency and his [tendency to preach about it](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/02/meet-bitcoin-jesus-a-virtual-currency-millionaire.html). Born in California, Ver renounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.

According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350116/dl?inline), Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he owned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is alleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and evaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means Ver’s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.

Ver’s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange [Binance founder Changpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering,](https://qz.com/binance-founder-cz-money-laundering-1851446897) received a four-month jail sentence. Previously, [Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange](https://qz.com/sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentence-ftx-collapse-1851371007), was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

*   **Polygon (MATIC) has dived to near-yearly lows.**
*   **MATIC’s price action follows a broader market dip led by Bitcoin.**
*   **A critical U.S. macroeconomic data release expected today could be essential to MATIC’s short-term fate.**

[Polygon (MATIC)](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-second-layer-of-blockchain/) sees red.

After [a parabolic run in Q1 2024](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-matic-price-hits-12-month-high-in-bitcoin-led-rally/), crypto assets, including Polygon’s native token MATIC, are now experiencing a rout. A recent [Bitcoin](https://dailycoin.com/bitcoin-btc-birth-cryptocurrency-blockchain-revolution/)\-led market flush has sent MATIC near yearly lows amid this decline.

Polygon (MATIC) Dives Below $0.65
---------------------------------

Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has tanked about 7%, from around $0.6759 to lows of around $0.6322, near 2024 lows of $0.5885.

MATIC’s price rout is part of a broader market dump that has seen Bitcoin’s price drop by about $2,500 in the two hours from about $60,000 to just below $57,500. The jitters come as the market awaits the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision [slated for](https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar) 6:00 pm UTC, Wednesday, May 1. 

With the Fed expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like crypto.  

MATIC boasts support within the $0.6467 and $0.6314 price range. At the time of writing, the asset is already showing resilience, bouncing from $0.6322 to trade at $0.6653. Bulls would want this momentum to continue, as a break below the current support could see the asset tank as low as $0.5.

The Fed’s rate hike decision is critical to MATIC’s continued run in the short term. While leaving rates unchanged or raising rates could lead to mild or significant price corrections, a shock decision to engage in rate cuts could fuel a parabolic run to the upside. 

On the Flipside 
----------------

*   **MATIC is not the only asset that experienced a price drop in the Bitcoin-led correction. Leading assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana are also experiencing price corrections of about 3.2%, 2.8%, and 4%, respectively, per** [**_CoinGecko_** **data**](https://www.coingecko.com/) **at the time of writing.**

Why This Matters 
-----------------

The price action of the past 24 hours puts MATIC in a precautionary position. If it fails to hold support, the asset risks a 30% drop to $0.5.

Markdown Content:
Economist and trader **Alex Krüger** shared thoughts on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, pointing out what, according to his interpretation, is driving the current price action and why the bull market is [not over yet](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38555886/this-trader-sees-bitcoin-dropping-to-40-000-and-still-be-fine-expect-lower-prices-but-dont).

**What Happened:** Krüger highlights **Bitcoin** BTC/USD ETF as the primary force behind the cycle, while **Ethereum** ETH/USD has been a “major disappointment” despite performing well for stakers and airdrop farmers.

He adds that **Solana** SOL/USD has established itself as the preferred chain for retail traders, demonstrating "perfect product-market fit" and even overtaking Ethereum. However, the network’s congestion and subsequent crashes have opened the door for competitors like Base to position themselves as viable alternatives for retail traders.

Noting the marginal new retail interest in crypto, Krüger states that most of the participants are ETF buyers and those from previous cycles redeploying their funds and taking on more risk. Those who missed the Bitcoin ETF run, crypto market participants with “PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” went all-in on altcoins. But those disappointed with significant losses, as numerous altcoins erased their 2024 gains in the past month.

**Why It Matters:** While many meme coins have gone to zero, Krüger writes they have dominated the narrative alongside Bitcoin as large-cap meme coins are among the strongest performers of the year. They have also established themselves as "a viable asset class in their own right."

He attributed the market's volatility to the increasing presence of scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders mainly since February. These founders prioritize short-term hype and quick profits over long-term sustainability.

Krüger maintains that the current crypto cycle “is not over” and there are still numerous opportunities for investors who navigate the market carefully and stay attuned to the evolving trends and narratives.

This analysis comes amid Bitcoin's huge price plunge of 5% in a single day pushing prices below the $58,000 mark.

Markdown Content:
**Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing financial transactions linked to Block, a firm founded by Jack Dorsey, focusing on potential violations at its divisions, Cash App and Square.**

According to sources, this investigation stems from documents indicating that Block processed crypto transactions for terrorist organizations and Square handled transactions involving countries under US sanctions.

Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Scrutiny
----------------------------------

The Southern District of New York’s inquiry began after an ex-employee provided documents revealing that Square and Cash App failed to collect adequate information for risk assessment. The employee [claimed](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181) that despite being aware, Block did not report numerous transactions involving sanctioned countries to the government as required.

&gt; “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was awed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program,” the former employee said.

These allegations come at a time when Cash App boasts 56 million active accounts and processed transactions worth $248 billion last year alone. The platform is popular for its instant money transfer service and ability to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.

Despite its success, Cash App’s design might contribute to compliance risks. Balances are typically depleted before any review can occur, limiting sanctions enforcement’s effectiveness. For this reason, the former employee argued that the [compliance lapses were well-known within Block’s leadership](https://beincrypto.com/jack-dorseys-block-faces-wrath-hindenburg/) circles, including Jack Dorsey.

&gt; “Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations,” a Block spokesperson stated.

The potential fallout of this investigation could be significant for [Jack Dorsey’s Block](https://beincrypto.com/block-ceo-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-mining-system/) as it navigates regulatory challenges and seeks to maintain its reputation. This scrutiny coincides with the resignation of two key board members, intensifying the spotlight on Block’s governance and compliance practices.

*   **Roger Ver** **is arrested on** **allegations** **of** **tax** **evasion.**
*   **Some** **observers** **believe** **US** **authorities****’** **actions** **are unjustified.** 
*   **The incident has triggered** **debate** **on the** **morality** **of** **taxation****.**

[Roger Ver](https://dailycoin.com/?s=roger+ver) was an early adopter and evangelist of Bitcoin, amassing a vast fortune by believing in the digital currency at a time when most dismissed it as worthless “magical internet money.” 

Ver acquired St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship in 2014 and renounced his US citizenship shortly after. Although Ver thought he was free of US control, authorities arrested the Bitcoin Cash proponent over the weekend on mail fraud and tax evasion charges, stoking government overreach concerns.

DoJ Coming For Roger Ver
------------------------

Roger Ver was [arrested in Spain](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-jesus-arrested-spain-us-tax-evasion-charges-2024-04-30/) over the weekend on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking Ver’s extradition to the US to stand trial over the charges, particularly unpaid taxes totaling $48 million. Ver’s lawyer, Bryan Skarlatos, stated that his client had relied on tax professionals to report his Bitcoin holdings properly and always intended to comply with regulations.

The outstanding tax liabilities stem from Ver’s 2014 renunciation of his US citizenship. Under citizen renunciation, individuals are required to pay an exit tax, with assets held treated as being sold at fair market value and any subsequent gains subject to an “expatriation tax.” The DoJ alleged that Ver and two of his companies, MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com, held around 131,000 BTC at that time.

In this case, prosecutors claimed Ver provided misleading information to undervalue his companies’ Bitcoin holdings when preparing the expatriation filings. The indictment claimed that in November 2017, Ver took possession of 70,000 BTC from his companies and sold them for around $240 million but failed to pay taxes owed on those distributions.

The DoJ stated that although Ver was not a US citizen when cashing out the 70,000 BTC, he was still [legally required](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) to report distributions from his companies and pay taxes on the sale of the BTC.  

Given the spate of perceived attacks on the crypto industry by US authorities lately, some have labeled Ver’s arrest as an unjustified overreach on the part of the US government. 

Crypto Clampdown?
-----------------

Several observers labeled Ver’s arrest a massive overreach by the US government. Simply, Bitcoin host Nico tied this incident to the recent arrest of [Samourai Wallet devs](https://dailycoin.com/why-samourai-wallet-is-in-hot-water-with-doj/), stating that the two events equate to the government “sending a message” to the cryptocurrency community.

&gt; It’s not a coincidence that Roger Ver and the Samouri wallet devs got arrested around the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; They are sending a message.

Kurt Wuckert Jr., the founder of BSV miner Gorilla Pool, dived into a [philosophical point](https://twitter.com/kurtwuckertjr/status/1785413818425704750) on the morality of taxation itself, commenting that “Failure to bribe the government so they don’t put you in a cage is not a crime. Demanding the bribe is evil.” Likewise, podcaster [“Walker” stated](https://twitter.com/WalkerAmerica/status/1785394785840189729) that “The United States of America holds its citizens prisoner.”

Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson took a different view by [addressing the charges](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1785383884659773658) against Ver. Hoskinson noted that Ver’s two companies were US-based, meaning Ver still had a tax obligation to the US even though he had renounced his US citizenship. Nonetheless, Hoskinson hoped that the allegations against Ver would be proven false.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The** [**MemoryDealers.com** **URL**](http://memorydealers.com/) **diverts to a** **tweet** **from** **Ver** **expressing** **distrust** **of the** **US** **government****.** 
*   **Servicing the US national debt is expected to cost $531 billion in 2024, making it the fifth largest government spending program.**

Why This Matters
----------------

Some maintain that taxation is theft, but the reality is that tax is the price to pay for living in a civilized society. However, the timing of Ver’s arrest is somewhat puzzling, given that the allegations occurred nearly seven years ago.

Recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As reported by Bloomberg, several major US-listed Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.

Bloomberg data shows that funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) traded well below their NAV. ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds.

Experts offer explanations for this phenomenon. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs. These factors can lead to temporary discrepancies between market prices and NAV.

However, Bloomberg [underscores](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/bitcoin-btc-etfs-flash-signs-of-stress-as-discounts-reach-records?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2) that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses unique complexities for ETF investors compared to traditional asset classes. This same volatility also creates lucrative opportunities for authorized participants, the specialized traders responsible for maintaining price alignment between ETFs and their NAV.

Virtu Financial Inc. CEO Douglas A. Cifu, as reported by Bloomberg, highlights these volatility-driven opportunities as a reason for continued optimism in crypto ETFs, despite the recent discounts.

The current macroeconomic climate, with the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, adds further pressure to the crypto market. As Bloomberg notes, speculative assets like Bitcoin often struggle in such environments.

WallachBeth Capital’s ETF director Mohit Bajaj suggests that the observed discounts could persist depending on Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

Runes have been taking over the **Bitcoin** BTC/USD network. This new token standard that launched with the latest Bitcoin halving has been mentioned before in this newsletter, in the context of pushing the average transaction fee on Bitcoin upwards even before their debut as hype stirred and helping miners combat a lower block subsidy reward as transaction fee revenue reached new highs. And both of those trends largely still hold.
