*   Rootstock's new plan to bring programmability to Bitcoin could unfold over the next 12 months.

*   The project could lead to the development of layer-2 networks atop Bitcoin without requiring any major changes to the blockchain's underlying code.

*   Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine developer known for his early work on Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin stash, discussed the project Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ developer conference in Austin.


AUSTIN, TEXAS — The founder of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol [Rootstock](https://rootstock.io/) has detailed plans for a new "BitVMX" project designed to improve the oldest blockchain's programmability by keying off developer Robin Linus's much-discussed "[BitVM](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/13/bitcoin-researcher-behind-bitvm-ignites-fresh-buzz-with-new-paper-on-file-hosting/)" design unveiled last year.

Sergio Demian Lerner, a Buenos Aires-based programmer known for his early research on Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's mining activities and later for contributing to the Ethereum blockchain's development, discussed the project onstage Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ conference in Austin, Texas.

"We have a roadmap to finish this in one year" and "we are moving forward at full speed," Lerner said during the presentation.

Linus's [release of BitVM last year](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/11/bitcoin-might-get-ethereum-style-smart-contracts-under-bitvm-plan/) has been widely cited by Bitcoin developers as a breakthrough for the 15-year-old blockchain since it theoretically would facilitate the development of programmable layer-2 networks similar to those that are being used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to make transactions cheaper and faster. Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code – seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades.

Lerner had disclosed last month during an exclusive interview last week on CoinDesk's [The Protocol podcast](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-protocol/rootstock-bringing-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-bitcoin/) that he was working with colleagues on the new project without providing details.

Last week, Rootstock Labs published a [blog post](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/content-hub/announcing-bitvmx-an-advanced-computational-layer-for-bitcoin/) on the effort, arguing that "theory and practice are two very different things," referring to Linus's original concept.

"The BitVMX research team intends to build on this initial discovery with additional innovations to create an improved development framework for running programs on Bitcoin," according to the blog post. "The name is a nod to BitVMX’s origins while highlighting its focus on extending Bitcoin and accelerating the development of the next generation of sidechains and layer 2s."

Rootstock Labs added that "a team of core contributors is working on a public roadmap of proposed improvements to the network in the next 12 months."

According to an accompanying [whitepaper](https://bitvmx.org/), "BitVMX framework provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compilation toolchain" – a technical description of the new system that boils down to facilitating a "myriad of use cases."

Published Time: 2024-05-01T17:31:54.000Z

Two figures once considered to be titans in the crypto industry are going to prison in the United States for drastically different amounts of time.

Since the sentencing hearings for former FTX CEO [Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/sam-bankman-fried-and-caroline-ellison) and former Binance CEO [Changpeng “CZ” Zhao](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/changpeng-zhao), many in and out of the crypto space have questioned why the two industry leaders have received such different treatment in the U.S. legal system. Bankman-Fried could be in his fifties by the time he leaves prison and will likely have fewer assets than Zhao, who will be out of prison by the end of the year and, according to Forbes, has an estimated net worth of $33 billion.

But let’s back up a minute.

Bankman-Fried was arrested in 2022, extradited to the United States, pleaded not guilty, given house arrest, remanded to jail after allegations of witness intimidation, prosecuted in a six-week trial, found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Zhao was charged in 2023, pleaded guilty, was allowed to remain free on bail, was sentenced to four months in prison and will surrender himself in a matter of days.

The former FTX CEO faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misuse of customer funds. CZ faced one charge related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.

“CZ was charged with a crime that is more akin to a regulatory violation: the failure to have an adequate system of Anti-Money Laundering controls, while SBF was charged with wire fraud in connection with the secret plundering of billions of dollars in crypto custody with FTX to prop up Alameda,” Mark Bini, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While both \[crimes\] are serious, SBF’s crime was far more serious.” ![Image 1: two men shaking hands in front of a t shirt](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/edece203-846c-4f01-93d8-b3e61930dfb8.png)

_Source: [Tiffany Fong](https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1785392750193746077)_

From the beginning of his legal woes, Bankman-Fried and his defense team have largely maintained that he “did what \[he\] thought was right.” In the sentencing hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan accused the former FTX CEO of lying on the stand and [described his testimony](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-years-prison-hold) as “evasive.” His first interview after the judge laid down a 25-year judgment [included SBF saying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-post-sentencing-statement): “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal.”

The facts of the case presented at trial also undermined SBF’s defense. Many government witnesses, including his former girlfriend and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, [suggested that he orchestrated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/caroline-ellison-testifies-sam-bankman-fried-trial) the misuse of FTX user funds.

In contrast, Zhao did not publicly comment on the case between U.S. authorities and Binance [since a $4.3 billion settlement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-officials-announce-binance-settlement) and his guilty plea in November 2023. He submitted hundreds of pages worth of letters from industry leaders, family members and others. Judge Richard Jones [commented on the outpouring](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-binance-sentenced-prison) of support for CZ at his sentencing hearing, adding he had “risked \[his\] entire net worth” for Binance. “Even though I believe he was guilty of much more, the DOJ didn’t have the evidence, and that’s why they could only get CZ to admit to rather light crimes,” Swan Bitcoin managing Director Terrence Yang told Cointelegraph. “Unlike SBF, \[...\] CZ didn’t fight extradition (was in a non-extradition country) and agreed to only light crimes in his plea deal. CZ is only paying $50 million in his plea deal with the DOJ.” ![Image 2: peter hahn tweets a picture of a man and a woman](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/dcf191b6-558f-4ca6-9278-e69dd9e843e7.png)

Despite speculation from many crypto users, it is doubtful that CZ and SBF will share a cell while incarcerated, let alone be housed in the same facility. Though the judge in SBF’s case suggested that he would serve in a San Francisco Bay Area prison, he may also allow the former FTX CEO to [stay in New York](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prison-appeal) during his appeal. Zhao will [serve four months](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-facility-seattle)[](https://cointelegraph.com/news/changpeng-zhao-prison-facility-seattle) at the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington, with a reporting date to be determined. **_Magazine:_** [**_‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame_**](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/celsius-alex-maskinsky-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-court-inner-city-press-x-hall-of-flame/)

Dubai's crypto-friendly policies and infrastructure fuel its rise as a global innovation hub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOKEN2049, a global conference series for the crypto industry, concluded its inaugural Dubai event with resounding success despite facing unprecedented weather challenges. The conference, which took place from April 18-19 during TOKEN2049 Week, attracted a record-breaking 10,000 attendees from over 160 countries.

Torrential rains, the heaviest in the UAE’s recorded history, threatened to disrupt the event. However, the crypto community’s resilience shone through as attendees braved the elements to participate in the sold-out conference.

&gt; “This week we witnessed the determination of the crypto industry first hand,” said Alex Fiskum, Co-Founder of TOKEN2049. “Our programme proceeded and our doors opened as planned, welcoming attendees to a comfortable, immersive, and action-packed event.”

TOKEN2049 Dubai featured an impressive lineup of over 200 industry leaders, including Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram; Richard Teng, CEO of Binance; Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether; and Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder of BitMEX.

The event was marked by significant announcements, such as Tether’s partnership with Telegram to launch USDT on The Open Network (TON), Polkadot’s introduction of a new JAM chain graypaper, Berachain’s collaboration with Google Cloud, and Telos’ partnership with Ponos Technology to develop an Ethereum L2 zkEVM network.

Looking ahead, TOKEN2049 Singapore is set to raise the bar even higher, with an expected 20,000 attendees converging at the iconic Marina Bay Sands on September 18-19, just before the Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend.

&gt; “Energized by this success, we now shift focus to prepare for the industry’s largest event of the year,” Fiskum stated.

Bitcoin has pulled back 22% from its all-time high in March. Now, on-chain intelligence company Glassnode suggests the market could be “hammering out a local bottom formation.” 

In a new [report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-18-2024/), the firm suggests that the market is currently still in a “euphoria” phase—a period in a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin. When investors are in this state, the market should expect a correction.

With [Bitcoin crashing to $57,000](https://decrypt.co/228938/bitcoin-crashes-to-57000-and-ethereum-slips-below-3000-hours-before-fed-meeting) at the time of writing, many investors believe we’re currently experiencing such a correction. But how much further will this drawback go?

Glassnode said that a good way to identify whether we've reached the local bottom is when short-term investors realize losses. Its historical data shows numerous examples from 2020 until now that show when one-week to one-month-old entities realize losses, Bitcoin’s price often begins to climb shortly after.

Carlos Mercado, data scientist at analytics company Flipside Crypto, told _Decrypt_, “I'm inclined to believe Glassnode is correctly identifying the ‘paper hands’ phenomenon within a specific cohort.”

“Paper hand” investors leave the market at the highest rate when the market is reaching its bottom. As long as the [market-value-to-realized-value](https://academy.glassnode.com/market/mvrv/mvrv-ratio) (MVRV) ratio—a measure of an asset's market cap versus the value stored in the asset—remains between 1.0 and 0.9, it has a chance to bounce back.

Fortunately, the market is within this band, providing hope that it can rebound.

“It could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation,” the report explained. “That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.”

Since the publication of this report, the price of BTC has continued to slide from $66,700 down to $57,000. Is this the beginning of the paper-hands sell-off that the report predicts? Or will it go lower?

“Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday, the closest consolidation to the current price level was in the $50,000 to $52,000 area,” senior market analyst at [FxPro](https://www.fxpro.com/) Alex Kuptsikevich explained to _Decrypt._

“A more dramatic scenario suggests a pullback to the $40,000 to $44,000 area, which would shake the weak hands out of the market before we get sustained interest from new buyers,” Kuptsikevich added.

The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate of 5.25%% to 5.5% at the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Wednesday, following a fearsome 6% drawdown in Bitcoin’s price earlier that day.

Within five minutes of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price rose from $57,300 to $57,700

*   Per a [press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm), the central bank said it also plans to slow down the rate at which it sells US Treasury securities starting in June, reducing its monthly redemption cap from $60 billion to $25 billion.
*   Market participants [overwhelmingly expected](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) the Fed to maintain its interest rate at 5.25% heading into the meeting, expecting cuts to potentially take off in Q4.
*   However, words from the central bank confirmed market fears that the central bank may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell nationwide price inflation, which remains stubbornly above 3%.
*   “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” the Fed wrote.
*   The economy also remains surprisingly resilient: data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that 81% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have filed their Q1 earnings have beaten their first-quarter expectations.
*   Bitcoin’s price is known to be influenced by central bank policy and macroeconomic liquidity conditions.  
Some analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe BTC will continue to [surge past](https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-bitcoin-btc-will-not-stop-at-100k-arthur-hayes-live-from-token2049/) $100,000 as central bank balance sheets continue to expand.

*   **Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose.**
*   **This comes as crypto traders lose $400M following Bitcoin’s crash to $56K.**
*   **Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s long-term outperformance compared to traditional assets.**

While crypto investors shoulder substantial losses over the past day amid the market retracement, renowned [Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor](https://coinedition.com/michael-saylors-bitcoin-leveraged-strategy-transforming-1-income-to-400m-profit/) took to X to reassure enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains the essential asset they cannot afford to overlook. In his words, “Bitcoin is for the money you can’t afford to lose.”

Saylor’s commentary comes amid Bitcoin’s price correction in the past few days, culminating in the asset revisiting the $56K range. At the press time value of $57,568, BTC is trading at one of its lowest points in the two months.

Following the asset’s substantial crash in the last few hours, at least 141K crypto traders who had placed bets on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory have been liquidated, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million. Nonetheless, Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, remains confident that this downturn should be less concerning for Bitcoin investors.

The short video accompanying Saylor’s tweet illustrated Bitcoin’s performance over the past eight years compared to various traditional investments, including the S&amp;P 500, Gold, U.S. real estate, U.S. dollar, Nigerian Naira, Turkish Lira, and Argentine Peso.

It depicted that while Bitcoin maintained an over 100% gain year-on-year since 2016, these other investments struggled to attain comparable returns.

For instance, in 2019, Gold and U.S. real estate saw significant gains of around 20%. However, these gains gradually diminished over the years to single-digit percentages. At the same time, currencies like the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso experienced crashes, plummeting to as low as 0.001%.

These outcomes have solidified Saylor’s belief that Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose. Responding to Saylor’s sentiment, X user AfriBull [remarked](https://x.com/Afri_bull/status/1785439846745493906), “Bitcoin has become the ultimate hedge against fiat volatility globally.”

As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.25-5.50%.

Also pretty much as expected, [the FOMC acknowledged](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240501a.htm) that progress on lower inflation has stalled this year and said it wouldn't be appropriate to trim rates until it has greater confidence inflation is moving "sustainably" towards 2%.

CZ's 4-Month Sentence Seems 'Minimal' for the Crime Committed: Legal Expert


The price of bitcoin [(BTC)](https://coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/"BitcoinPrice|BTCPriceIndexandLiveChart-CoinDesk") has bounced modestly in the minutes since the news hit, but remains under pressure, down more than 4% for the session at $58,000.

In addition to the rate news, the FOMC announced it is slowing the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. Other things being equal, the move is likely to boost risk appetite and asset prices, wrote economist Joseph Brusuelas.

Markets came into 2024 expecting a long series of rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, but those hopes have been whittled down sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to show strength and inflation has actually risen a bit in the year's first four months. According [the CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing in a nearly 25% chance of zero rate cuts this year. One month ago, there was just a 1% chance of no Fed easing in 2024.

That change in expectations has weighed a bit on traditional markets, with the Nasdaq lower by about 5% since hitting its 2024 high about three weeks ago and the S&amp;P 500 off by a similar amount since touching its year-to-date high in late March. It's also likely contributed to the plunging bitcoin price, which is now down more than 20% from its record high from mid-March above $73,000.

A check of traditional markets shortly after the FOMC announcement, finds stocks remaining little-changed and the dollar and bond yields slightly lower. Gold is up 0.5% at $2,316 per ounce but remains about 4% down from its record high above $2,400 hit in mid-April.

Further clues to the Fed's thinking will come shortly as Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m ET.

Digital securities platform Securitize has raised $47 million in a new strategic funding round led by BlackRock. Blockchain developers Aptos Labs and Paxos, and stablecoin issuer Circle, were also among the investors.

Proceeds from the funding round will be used for product development, global expansion and strengthening partnerships in the financial services ecosystem, Securitize [said](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/securitize-announces-47-million-strategic-funding-round-led-by-blackrock-302133075.html) in a statement.

BlackRock global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom will join the Securitize board of directors. Chalom called the investment in Securitize “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy \[…\] that will help meet the future needs of our clients." ![Image 2: a twittee with the words'security' and confetti](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-05/9e8955bd-4bc7-4ed4-944b-69b0f0d20a5e.png)

Securitize partnered with BlackRock as a transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent on the March launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first tokenized fund.

BUIDL invests in cash, United States Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, and pays dividends accrued daily through a monthly deposit of tokens stably worth $1. BUIDL holders have the option to transfer their shares to Circle in exchange for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)) stablecoin.

In the six weeks of its existence, BUIDL amassed a market cap of $375 million to become the largest tokenized treasury fund, surpassing the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI) by $7 million. There is currently $1.28 billion locked in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, [according](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries) to RWA.xyz.

Investment manager Hamilton Lane, which has worked with Securitize since 2022, also contributed to the fundraise, along with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. Aptos Labs co-founder and CEO Mo Shaikh told Cointelegraph:

&gt; “Aptos Labs is \[…\] a key participant in closing the gap between traditional finance and open finance in a very real and globally accessible way. With leaders like BlackRock and pioneers like Securitize at the helm, there’s no doubt that a significant piece of the future of finance will play out onchain.” Securitize is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as broker-dealer and transfer agent and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) self-regulatory organization. **_Magazine: [Crypto City: Guide to San Francisco Bay Area](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-city-guide-san-francisco-bay-area/)_**

Over $340 million of long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.

Crypto markets continued to slide on Wednesday morning, hours before the Federal Reserve is due to release its interest rate decision.

Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $57,000, its lowest level since late February, after dropping 6% over the past 24 hours.

Ether (ETH) traded as low as $2,820, while Dogecoin (DOGE) slid by 8%. Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) both suffered losses of about 7%.

![Image 1: ETH Price chart](https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F6oftkxoa%2Fproduction%2F2dab1fd78d723535846217793884369a37e60158-806x475.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=100)

CoinGlass [reported](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) that over $421 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with over $349 million of these liquidated future positions being long. Being long on an asset means betting that its price will go up, while being short on it means betting that it will go down.

Markus Thielen, CEO and head analyst of 10x Research, believes that Bitcoin may drop to $52,000. “The primary driver for the recent Bitcoin price rally was the inflow of funds into Bitcoin ETFs, which has now dried up over the past 4-5 weeks. The market internals have become weaker,” he said in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thielen10x/status/1785454835191701566) on X.

Wall Street awaits Fed rate decision
------------------------------------

Stock markets slipped on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision.

Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 market index decreased by 0.51%, while Nasdaq 100 futures saw a drop of 0.82%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also experienced a decline of 0.26%.

MicroStrategy (MSTR), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw a 5% drop. Coinbase (COIN), a major cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a 3.5% loss.

Mining stocks continue to be pummeled. Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) saw their share values fall by 3.2% and 3.5%, respectively.

The U.S. central bank will release its rate policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, following which Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong debut of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs didn't make a big splash on their first day, with a trading volume of just over $11 million.

Yet, considering the relatively smaller size of the Hong Kong ETF market compared to the U.S., ETF analyst Eric Balchunas [noted](https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1785283076802707563) that the debut was more successful than perceived."If you localize numbers, this was big," Balchunas said.

The Federal Reserve Wednesday elected to keep its key interest rate steady as the central bank’s focus on fighting inflation compounded pain in the crypto market.

In his typically cautious tone, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% was difficult but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”

“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”

He would not reveal to reporters when there would be a rate cut.

“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell added in a prepared statement.

As of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 4.6% and 1.3% over the past day to $57,600 and $2,945, respectively, according to [CoinGecko](https://decrypt.co/degen-alley). Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen slightly throughout the trading day.

But while the daily shift is broadly downward, both [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) and [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) have marked slight increases over the past hour, including ahead of and since the rate announcement. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past hour, while Ethereum has perked up by 2% during the same span.

If you think the recent dips in the price of Bitcoin is bad, leading financial firm Standard Chartered could further darken your mood, concluding that the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap could fall as far as $50,000. In a Wednesday note, Geoffrey Kendrick—digital assets researcher at the British company and lead author of the report—said that “the broader macro backdrop has deteriorated for assets like crypto that thrive on liquidity.” “The driver seems to be a combination of crypto specifi...

Signs of stubborn inflation have lent traders pause, as [fears boiled over](https://decrypt.co/227213/bitcoin-bull-run-halving-etfs-experts-weigh-in) last month that the Fed could be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.

Shifting rate expectations are driving Bitcoin’s price more as spot Bitcoin ETFs see [pittering inflows](https://decrypt.co/228620/digital-asset-investment-funds-lose-cash-three-weeks?amp=1), CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill told _Decrypt_ Monday.

Inflation has fallen steadily from multi-decade highs in 2022, but it remains above the Fed’s target of 2% annually. When inflation clocked in at 3.5% in the 12 months through March, a lack of change compared to the previous month’s release caused crypto markets to [shudder immediately](https://decrypt.co/225622/bitcoin-ethereum-dive-us-inflation-data).

The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a target range of between 5.25% and 5.5% since July of last year, pushing forward for months with the highest rates in more than 23 years.

Amid an apparently growing crackdown on the crypto industry from American regulators, U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Block, the Jack Dorsey-founded company behind Square and Cash App. Federal prosecutors have been probing the internal processes of the company—including its crypto business—according to a report from NBC News published Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors are reportedly investigating "alleged widespread and yearslong compliance...

Higher interest rates, which can slow the economy through increased borrowing costs, are generally bad news for risk assets like stocks and crypto. That’s because the payout on cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries becomes relatively more attractive as rates move and stay higher.

Though the Fed in March had [penciled in](https://decrypt.co/222627/bitcoin-price-barely-budges-federal-reserve-interest-rates) three quarter-percentage point cuts for 2024, traders have grown less hopeful. According to the CME’s [FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), financial market participants may see only one rate cute—or zero—by year’s end.

As rate cut expectations inched further out in April, Bitcoin notched its worst month since November 2022. Coming off all-time highs in March, Bitcoin fell 14% throughout the month to around $60,000.

In April, Powell [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fed-chair-powell-says-lack-progress-year-inflation-rcna148075) that inflation hasn’t come down as quickly as policymakers expected, suggesting rate cuts could still be far out. Yet the Fed chair signaled interest rates, where they currently are, could also be sufficient to get the job done too.

“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” he said. “That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.”

URL Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/bitcoin-jumps-dxy-falls-as-fed-to-reduce-bond-selling

Markdown Content:
The Federal Reserve Banks are slowing down the quantitative tightening (QT) by lowering the rate of bond selling.

"Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion," it [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240501a1.pdf), adding:

"The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities."

They will also keep interest rates at current levels until the next meeting in June as they wait for inflation to move to 2%.

The reduction by more than 50% in bond selling every month, combined with an announcement by the Treasury of a bonds buyback plan, should lower the yield with it dropping 45 basis points on this announcement for the 10 year Treasuries.

Lower bond yields should reduce the cost of debt overall, making this a soft rate cut ahead of the [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0unztmcLvA) by Fed's chair Jerome Powell when we'll learn more.

Bitcoin rose above $58,000 from $57,000 on the announcement while a volatile dollar index, DXY, dipped to 105.7 initially, to now 105.8 from 105.9.

No strong directional move yet therefore ahead of the conference as markets digest this announcement.

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/federal-reserve-holds-interest-rates-level

Markdown Content:
In a highly anticipated move, the Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates at their existing level on Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee two-day policy meeting. 

The rate hike pause marks the central bank’s sixth since consecutively raising interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023. Persistent inflation and a healthy labor market contributed to central bankers’ decision to hold rates, they said. 

“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” Wednesday’s [statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240501a1.pdf) read. “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” 

Central bankers will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting rates, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday during a press conference.

“The path forward is uncertain,” [Powell](https://blockworks.co/tag/jerome-powell) said. 

“Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,” he added.

Stocks and cryptocurrencies were little changed on the news. Bitcoin ([BTC](https://blockworks.co/price/btc)) traded sideways in the moments after the [Fed](https://blockworks.co/tag/federal-reserve) released its statement at 2 pm ET, sitting around $57,786 at time of publication, per Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. 

Ether ([ETH](https://blockworks.co/price/eth)) similarly traded flat, hovering around $2,900 at time of publication – about 1% lower over 24 hours. 

The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes inched marginally higher on the news, managing to move just barely into the green after an otherwise disappointing trading session. 

Bitcoin has hovered below $60,000 since early Wednesday, a downward trend analysts say is poised to continue. 

“A break to the downside through $59,200 in BTC has led to an accelerated selloff and, barring an unforeseen catalyst, there seems little in the way of this market testing the \[$53,000\] area before a meaningful turnaround,” Mike Tauckus, head of trading and structuring at BitOoda, said. Markets on Wednesday expected about a 9% chance a rate cut will come in June, according to [data](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) from CME Group.

URL Source: https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/aave-proposes-v4-iteration-and-aave-network-validium

Published Time: 2024-05-01T19:00:00.000Z

Markdown Content:
Aave v4 will aggregate liquidity from multiple networks via a cross-chain liquidity layer.

Aave, the largest DeFi lending protocol by TVL, has proposed plans to launch a v4 iteration and validium network within the next three years.

Announced on May 1, Aave v4 will boast a unified cross-chain liquidity layer (CCLL), aggregating liquidity from across multiple networks within a single protocol. Aave noted that CCLL would be powered by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which completed its [permissionless rollout](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/chainlink-completes-permissionless-rollout-for-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol) last week.

“Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol,” the proposal said. “This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks.”

Aave v4 will also feature automated adjustments to its interest rate curve, dynamic interest rate premiums for riskier assets, smart accounts and vaults allowing users to segregate their borrowing activities, and an updated liquidation engine.

Aave said it hopes to begin prototyping its v4 protocol during Q4 and hopes to implement the code in Q2 2025. However, it does not expect the CCLL to roll out until 2026 or 2027.

The proposal also outlines plans to launch an Aave Network, which would function as the primary hub for the Aave protocol and the project’s GHO stablecoin.

Aave proposes utilizing a rollup-like [validium](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/vitalik-advocates-for-renewed-exploration-into-plasma-based-scaling-solutions) architecture for the network, adopting GHO as its network token for fees, and using AAVE as the main staking asset for decentralized validators and sequencers.

Aave noted it will monitor the evolution of both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks before finalizing the network’s architecture, but said Aave Network will inherit its security from Ethereum.

The proposal added that “Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance” and both Aave and GHO would continue to operate as “multichain and network-agnostic despite Aave’s plans to launch a bespoke network. Aave is also targeting 2026 or 2027 for the launch of Aave Chain.

Aave seeks to ensure future dominance
-------------------------------------

Aave is the third-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of $10 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

Recent research from Token Terminal indicated that Aave has consistently enjoyed a roughly [50%](https://twitter.com/tokenterminal/status/1759210742035746890/photo/1) share of the DeFi lending market over the past three years. Aave’s Marc Zeller [replied](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1759229791637524957) that roughly 75% of the value in DeFi lending protocols is locked in projects leveraging versions of Aave’s codebase.

Aave said its three-year plan seeks to maintain its position as a leading DeFi for the rest of the decade. “These ideas aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users,” the proposal said.

Aave’s three-year roadmap also includes promoting the development of real-world asset products built around GHO, expanding Aave onto networks that do not support Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, and introducing new visual branding licensed to the Aave DAO.

Aave is budgeting 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE ($2.1 million) to complete the first year of the roadmap, with the DAO providing 3M GHO upfront and streaming the remaining assets over the course of the first 12 months.

The price of AAVE is down 14% over the past week amid the recent digital asset downturn, according to CoinGecko. Aave noted that more than 450,000 wallets currently hold AAVE.

**Ladan Stewart, a former key figure at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has publicly refuted claims suggesting a governmental agenda against crypto.** 

She emphasizes that the regulatory body’s actions never aimed to stifle innovation in the nascent industry.

Cryptos Will Not Be Eliminated in the US
----------------------------------------

Stewart, now a partner at White &amp; Case LLP, [explained](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/05/01/former-top-sec-litigator-says-theres-no-systematic-plan-to-kill-crypto/?sh=13bf4efd4413) that during her tenure at the SEC, her primary focus was on litigating high-profile cases such as those against [Ripple](https://beincrypto.com/ripple-opposes-secs-fine-xrp-lawsuit/) and [Coinbase](https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-sec-hearing-underwhelming-crypto-lawyer/). She pointed out that the agency’s approach has always been technologically neutral.

Therefore, she clarified the widespread speculation about a deliberate crackdown the SEC has imposed on crypto businesses.

&gt; “The SEC is not trying to kill crypto. Our main concern has always been about ensuring investor protection and compliance within the industry,” Stewart stated. 

Her comments come at a time when industry leaders have voiced concerns about [harsh crypto regulatory measures](https://beincrypto.com/janet-yellen-urges-crypto-regulation/) potentially driving innovation out of the US.

According to Stewart, the industry’s compliance with regulations designed to protect investors is critical. The SEC’s efforts constantly ensure that investors have all the detailed information. While the [SEC will continue to enforce compliance](https://beincrypto.com/gary-gensler-misled-congress-ethereum/), there is no conspiracy to dismantle the crypto industry. 

Instead, the focus is on fostering a safe and compliant environment for investors. Which, in turn, supports the healthy growth of the sector.

In her view, open dialogue and [cooperation between regulators and the crypto community](https://beincrypto.com/sec-blackrock-spot-ethereum-etf-comments/) are essential for resolving ongoing tensions. Stewart’s insights underline a significant shift in regulatory strategies, focusing on education and compliance rather than restriction.

As someone who has transitioned from a governmental role to a private legal practice, Stewart aims to bridge the gap between the crypto industry and regulatory frameworks. Her new role involves guiding crypto businesses through the complex landscape of US regulations, striving for a balance that respects innovation and legal compliance.

Artificial intelligence can rapidly scan the massive Bitcoin blockchain for signs of illegal activity, a capability that could dramatically strengthen the work of law enforcement in combatting money laundering, a new [report](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/our-new-research-enhancing-blockchain-analytics-through-ai?utm_content=291576989&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-1344645140) explains.

Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic on Wednesday published a study with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab that analyzed Bitcoin transactions using a deep learning AI model to detect money laundering patterns and identify wallets used in crimes.

[Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) is renowned for using a decentralized public ledger—a core facet of the technology that also made the study possible, Elliptic said. Elliptic and MIT-IBM used AI to separate legal and illicit transactions into groups and follow links among the latter to uncover potential money laundering.

“Blockchains provide fertile ground for machine learning techniques, thanks to the availability of both transaction data and information on the types of entities that are transacting, collected by us and others,” Elliptic wrote. “This is in contrast to traditional finance where transaction data is typically siloed, making it challenging to apply these techniques.”

The test was not attempted with so-called “[privacy coins](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-privacy-coins-monero-zcash-and-dash-explained).”

[Did Law Enforcement Crack Privacy Coin Monero? It's Complicated](https://decrypt.co/214367/did-law-enforcement-crack-privacy-coin-monero-its-complicated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier this week, an article in Finnish publication MTV Uutiset claimed that Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (KRP) had succeeded in tracking transactions made using the privacy preserving cryptocurrency Monero. However, it's unlikely that Monero itself has been compromised, a former member of the MAGIC Monero Fund committee told Decrypt. Csilla Brimer said that investigators were likely able to trace some transactions because of faulty operational security on the part of users, rathe...

“Counterparty information is available for all transactions \[on Bitcoin\],” Elliptic co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom Robinson told _Decrypt_, adding that the technique could be applied to other open blockchains like [Solana](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps) and [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide). “This isn’t the case for privacy coins such as Monero.”

&gt; New Elliptic research released today explores how [#AI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) can be leveraged to detect money laundering and other financial crime on the blockchain. The research applies new techniques to a dataset containing 200m+ transactions, which is now publicly available. [https://t.co/k3GdjWJ08P](https://t.co/k3GdjWJ08P)

“Rather than identifying transactions made by illicit actors, a machine learning model is trained to identify ‘subgraphs,’ chains of transactions that represent Bitcoin being laundered,” Elliptic explained. “This approach allows us to focus on the ‘multi-hop’ laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors.”

According to Elliptic, the report published today continues work that the company began with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in 2019. Elliptic initially worked with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange to test their theory.

“Of 52 ‘money laundering’ subgraphs predicted by the model \[that\] ended with deposits to this exchange, the exchange confirmed that 14 had been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to money laundering,” the report said. “On average, less than one in 10,000 of these accounts are flagged as such, suggesting that the model performs very well.” [Crypto Exchange KuCoin Charged With 'Multi-Billion Dollar Criminal Conspiracy'](https://decrypt.co/223465/crypto-exchange-kucoin-charged-multi-billion-criminal-conspiracy)

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin and two of its founders were charged Tuesday by the United States Department of Justice with conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to operate a compliant anti-money laundering program. As a result, they allegedly enabled money laundering and terrorist activity to funnel through the platform. "As alleged, in failing to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies, the defendants allowed KuCoin to operate in the shadows of the financial markets...

Government regulators, particularly in the United States, have used money laundering laws as one of many cudgels to attack the cryptocurrency industry. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge in Seattle sentenced Binance founder [Changpeng “CZ” Zhao](https://decrypt.co/228674/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentence-money-laundering) to four months in federal prison for money laundering violations.

Last month, the founders of the Bitcoin mixer [Samourai Wallet](https://decrypt.co/227949/feds-arrest-founders-bitcoin-mixer-samourai-wallet) were arrested on charges of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice.

In the indictment, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said “threat actors” use technology like Samourai Wallet to evade law enforcement detection and create environments conducive to criminal activity.

“While offering Samourai as a ‘privacy’ service, the defendants knew that it was a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion,” the DOJ said in the indictment. ”Indeed, as the defendants intended and well knew, a substantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal proceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment.”

As expected, the FED left interest rates constant. In the statement published after the decision, it was stated that there have been deficiencies in reaching the 2% inflation target in the recent period.

Now, FED President Jerome Powell's press conference, which started at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3), is being followed closely.

As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are bringing you this conversation live. You can access Jerome Powell's latest remarks by refreshing the page. You can also find the official live broadcast link right below.

*   Inflation fell significantly last year but remains very high.
*   Further progress on inflation is not guaranteed; The path is unclear.
*   We are extremely careful about inflation risks.
*   The restrictive policy stance put downward pressure on inflation and the economy.
*   Risks to achieving bilateral goals have become better balanced in the past year.
*   The labor market remains relatively tight.
*   Nominal wage growth has decreased over the past year, but labor demand still exceeds supply.
*   This year's inflation data was higher than expected.
*   Our policy actions are guided by our goals.
*   FED officials are 'very aware' of the challenges posed by high inflation.
*   But long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
*   We do not think it would be appropriate to cut interest rates until we have greater confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
*   Gaining greater confidence is likely to take longer than previously expected.
*   Lowering policy too soon or too much, or too late or too little, both have risks.
*   Inflation data so far this year have not given us any more confidence.
*   Politics is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face.
*   We will make our decisions separately for each meeting.
*   The policy rate is at a restrictive level.
*   We believe it will be restrictive enough over time.
*   We believe that over time the policy is restrictive enough to reduce inflation to 2%.
*   The next policy move is unlikely to be a rate hike.
*   We are focused on how long to keep the policy restrictive.
*   To raise rates, we need to see evidence that the policy is not enough to bring inflation back to our target.
*   We think policy is well placed to consider the different paths the economy can take.
*   If inflation is more persistent and the labor market remains strong, it may be appropriate to postpone interest rate cuts.
*   But there are other avenues that point to a rate cut, but these would only come if we gain more confidence and there is an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
*   There is no obvious link between easing financial conditions and inflation.
*   I'm not ruling out that we could still have strong growth or that the labor market and inflation could continue to fall.
*   It is unlikely that the next move will be a rate hike.
*   To meet the inflation target, we will likely need to see wage growth slow to more sustainable levels.
*   I don't know how long it will take us to lower interest rates.
*   Powell: (when asked about 3 interest rate cuts this year) said only that the FED needs more confidence on inflation and does not see progress in Q1.
*   We need to take a cue from three worse-than-expected inflation data.
*   Once we gain confidence about inflation, interest rate cuts will be within scope.
*   The indication we are getting is that it will take longer to get on a sustainable path towards 2% inflation.
*   My expectation is that inflation will decline again this year.
*   My confidence that inflation will decline again is lower than before.
*   Question: Has the possibility of a rate cut decreased this year? Powell: I don't have a probability estimate. We need to be more confident, our confidence did not increase in the first quarter, on the contrary it will last longer than expected.
*   I don't know if inflation will drop enough to merit interest rate cuts.
*   I'm not sure whether there will be a rate cut this year or not.
*   In light of the data we have, I really don't understand where the talk of a stagflation scenario comes from.
*   I don't see stagflation related to growth or inflation.
*   3% inflation does not satisfy us.
*   Restrictive monetary policy needs more time to fulfill its duty.
*   We have peace of mind that we will do what we think is right, when we think it is right.
*   We've seen pretty consistent progress in slowing wage growth, but it's been bumpy.
*   It will take some time, but we will reduce inflation to 2%.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded modestly in the minutes since the news broke, but remains under pressure, falling more than 4% to $58,000 in 24 hours.

Markets entered 2024 expecting a long series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but those hopes have faded sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rose slightly in the first four months of the year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing the probability of a zero rate cut this year at around 25%. A month ago, the probability that the FED would not cut interest rates in 2024 was only 1%.

However, following the decision, many investors predict that the FED will make the only interest rate cut this year in November.

Early crypto investor Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ has been [charged with a tax fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud), with the Department of Justice saying he evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.

In an indictment filed in federal court in Los Angeles, 45-year-old Ver is charged with mail fraud and tax evasion. The DOJ stated that the indictment was unsealed after his arrest in Spain over the weekend, and the U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.

Ver earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” due to his early investments in cryptocurrency and his [tendency to preach about it](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/02/meet-bitcoin-jesus-a-virtual-currency-millionaire.html). Born in California, Ver renounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.

According to the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350116/dl?inline), Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he owned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is alleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and evaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means Ver’s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.

Ver’s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange [Binance founder Changpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering,](https://qz.com/binance-founder-cz-money-laundering-1851446897) received a four-month jail sentence. Previously, [Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange](https://qz.com/sam-bankman-fried-prison-sentence-ftx-collapse-1851371007), was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

*   **Polygon (MATIC) has dived to near-yearly lows.**
*   **MATIC’s price action follows a broader market dip led by Bitcoin.**
*   **A critical U.S. macroeconomic data release expected today could be essential to MATIC’s short-term fate.**

[Polygon (MATIC)](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-second-layer-of-blockchain/) sees red.

After [a parabolic run in Q1 2024](https://dailycoin.com/polygon-matic-price-hits-12-month-high-in-bitcoin-led-rally/), crypto assets, including Polygon’s native token MATIC, are now experiencing a rout. A recent [Bitcoin](https://dailycoin.com/bitcoin-btc-birth-cryptocurrency-blockchain-revolution/)\-led market flush has sent MATIC near yearly lows amid this decline.

Polygon (MATIC) Dives Below $0.65
---------------------------------

Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has tanked about 7%, from around $0.6759 to lows of around $0.6322, near 2024 lows of $0.5885.

MATIC’s price rout is part of a broader market dump that has seen Bitcoin’s price drop by about $2,500 in the two hours from about $60,000 to just below $57,500. The jitters come as the market awaits the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision [slated for](https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar) 6:00 pm UTC, Wednesday, May 1. 

With the Fed expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like crypto.  

MATIC boasts support within the $0.6467 and $0.6314 price range. At the time of writing, the asset is already showing resilience, bouncing from $0.6322 to trade at $0.6653. Bulls would want this momentum to continue, as a break below the current support could see the asset tank as low as $0.5.

The Fed’s rate hike decision is critical to MATIC’s continued run in the short term. While leaving rates unchanged or raising rates could lead to mild or significant price corrections, a shock decision to engage in rate cuts could fuel a parabolic run to the upside. 

On the Flipside 
----------------

*   **MATIC is not the only asset that experienced a price drop in the Bitcoin-led correction. Leading assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana are also experiencing price corrections of about 3.2%, 2.8%, and 4%, respectively, per** [**_CoinGecko_** **data**](https://www.coingecko.com/) **at the time of writing.**

Why This Matters 
-----------------

The price action of the past 24 hours puts MATIC in a precautionary position. If it fails to hold support, the asset risks a 30% drop to $0.5.

URL Source: https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38561876/how-bitcoin-etfs-and-crypto-markets-ptsd-caused-scammy-memecoin-launches-alex-kr-ger

Markdown Content:
Economist and trader **Alex Krüger** shared thoughts on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, pointing out what, according to his interpretation, is driving the current price action and why the bull market is [not over yet](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38555886/this-trader-sees-bitcoin-dropping-to-40-000-and-still-be-fine-expect-lower-prices-but-dont).

**What Happened:** Krüger highlights **Bitcoin** BTC/USD ETF as the primary force behind the cycle, while **Ethereum** ETH/USD has been a “major disappointment” despite performing well for stakers and airdrop farmers.

He adds that **Solana** SOL/USD has established itself as the preferred chain for retail traders, demonstrating "perfect product-market fit" and even overtaking Ethereum. However, the network’s congestion and subsequent crashes have opened the door for competitors like Base to position themselves as viable alternatives for retail traders.

Noting the marginal new retail interest in crypto, Krüger states that most of the participants are ETF buyers and those from previous cycles redeploying their funds and taking on more risk. Those who missed the Bitcoin ETF run, crypto market participants with “PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” went all-in on altcoins. But those disappointed with significant losses, as numerous altcoins erased their 2024 gains in the past month.

**Why It Matters:** While many meme coins have gone to zero, Krüger writes they have dominated the narrative alongside Bitcoin as large-cap meme coins are among the strongest performers of the year. They have also established themselves as "a viable asset class in their own right."

He attributed the market's volatility to the increasing presence of scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders mainly since February. These founders prioritize short-term hype and quick profits over long-term sustainability.

Krüger maintains that the current crypto cycle “is not over” and there are still numerous opportunities for investors who navigate the market carefully and stay attuned to the evolving trends and narratives.

This analysis comes amid Bitcoin's huge price plunge of 5% in a single day pushing prices below the $58,000 mark.

**Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing financial transactions linked to Block, a firm founded by Jack Dorsey, focusing on potential violations at its divisions, Cash App and Square.**

According to sources, this investigation stems from documents indicating that Block processed crypto transactions for terrorist organizations and Square handled transactions involving countries under US sanctions.

Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Scrutiny
----------------------------------

The Southern District of New York’s inquiry began after an ex-employee provided documents revealing that Square and Cash App failed to collect adequate information for risk assessment. The employee [claimed](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181) that despite being aware, Block did not report numerous transactions involving sanctioned countries to the government as required.

&gt; “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was awed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program,” the former employee said.

These allegations come at a time when Cash App boasts 56 million active accounts and processed transactions worth $248 billion last year alone. The platform is popular for its instant money transfer service and ability to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.

*   **The incident has triggered** **debate** **on the** **morality** **of** **taxation****.**

[Roger Ver](https://dailycoin.com/?s=roger+ver) was an early adopter and evangelist of Bitcoin, amassing a vast fortune by believing in the digital currency at a time when most dismissed it as worthless “magical internet money.” 

Ver acquired St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship in 2014 and renounced his US citizenship shortly after. Although Ver thought he was free of US control, authorities arrested the Bitcoin Cash proponent over the weekend on mail fraud and tax evasion charges, stoking government overreach concerns.

DoJ Coming For Roger Ver
------------------------

Roger Ver was [arrested in Spain](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-jesus-arrested-spain-us-tax-evasion-charges-2024-04-30/) over the weekend on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking Ver’s extradition to the US to stand trial over the charges, particularly unpaid taxes totaling $48 million. Ver’s lawyer, Bryan Skarlatos, stated that his client had relied on tax professionals to report his Bitcoin holdings properly and always intended to comply with regulations.

The outstanding tax liabilities stem from Ver’s 2014 renunciation of his US citizenship. Under citizen renunciation, individuals are required to pay an exit tax, with assets held treated as being sold at fair market value and any subsequent gains subject to an “expatriation tax.” The DoJ alleged that Ver and two of his companies, MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com, held around 131,000 BTC at that time.

In this case, prosecutors claimed Ver provided misleading information to undervalue his companies’ Bitcoin holdings when preparing the expatriation filings. The indictment claimed that in November 2017, Ver took possession of 70,000 BTC from his companies and sold them for around $240 million but failed to pay taxes owed on those distributions.

The DoJ stated that although Ver was not a US citizen when cashing out the 70,000 BTC, he was still [legally required](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-charged-tax-fraud) to report distributions from his companies and pay taxes on the sale of the BTC.  

Given the spate of perceived attacks on the crypto industry by US authorities lately, some have labeled Ver’s arrest as an unjustified overreach on the part of the US government. 

Crypto Clampdown?
-----------------

Several observers labeled Ver’s arrest a massive overreach by the US government. Simply, Bitcoin host Nico tied this incident to the recent arrest of [Samourai Wallet devs](https://dailycoin.com/why-samourai-wallet-is-in-hot-water-with-doj/), stating that the two events equate to the government “sending a message” to the cryptocurrency community.

&gt; It’s not a coincidence that Roger Ver and the Samouri wallet devs got arrested around the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; They are sending a message.

Kurt Wuckert Jr., the founder of BSV miner Gorilla Pool, dived into a [philosophical point](https://twitter.com/kurtwuckertjr/status/1785413818425704750) on the morality of taxation itself, commenting that “Failure to bribe the government so they don’t put you in a cage is not a crime. Demanding the bribe is evil.” Likewise, podcaster [“Walker” stated](https://twitter.com/WalkerAmerica/status/1785394785840189729) that “The United States of America holds its citizens prisoner.”

Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson took a different view by [addressing the charges](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1785383884659773658) against Ver. Hoskinson noted that Ver’s two companies were US-based, meaning Ver still had a tax obligation to the US even though he had renounced his US citizenship. Nonetheless, Hoskinson hoped that the allegations against Ver would be proven false.

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **The** [**MemoryDealers.com** **URL**](http://memorydealers.com/) **diverts to a** **tweet** **from** **Ver** **expressing** **distrust** **of the** **US** **government****.** 
*   **Servicing the US national debt is expected to cost $531 billion in 2024, making it the fifth largest government spending program.**

Why This Matters
----------------

Some maintain that taxation is theft, but the reality is that tax is the price to pay for living in a civilized society. However, the timing of Ver’s arrest is somewhat puzzling, given that the allegations occurred nearly seven years ago.

Recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As reported by Bloomberg, several major US-listed Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.

Bloomberg data shows that funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) traded well below their NAV. ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds.

Experts offer explanations for this phenomenon. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs. These factors can lead to temporary discrepancies between market prices and NAV.

However, Bloomberg [underscores](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/bitcoin-btc-etfs-flash-signs-of-stress-as-discounts-reach-records?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2) that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses unique complexities for ETF investors compared to traditional asset classes. This same volatility also creates lucrative opportunities for authorized participants, the specialized traders responsible for maintaining price alignment between ETFs and their NAV.

Virtu Financial Inc. CEO Douglas A. Cifu, as reported by Bloomberg, highlights these volatility-driven opportunities as a reason for continued optimism in crypto ETFs, despite the recent discounts.

The current macroeconomic climate, with the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, adds further pressure to the crypto market. As Bloomberg notes, speculative assets like Bitcoin often struggle in such environments.

WallachBeth Capital’s ETF director Mohit Bajaj suggests that the observed discounts could persist depending on Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

Runes have been taking over the **Bitcoin** BTC/USD network. This new token standard that launched with the latest Bitcoin halving has been mentioned before in this newsletter, in the context of pushing the average transaction fee on Bitcoin upwards even before their debut as hype stirred and helping miners combat a lower block subsidy reward as transaction fee revenue reached new highs. And both of those trends largely still hold. The 7-day moving average of the average transaction fee on Bitcoin reached over $40 last week, 10 times as high as the $4.10 average on **Ethereum** ETH/USD.

URL Source: https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/federal-prosecutors-in-the-u-s-investigate-another-cryptocurrency-company-this-time-targeting-a-surprising-name/

Markdown Content:
Federal prosecutors are currently investigating financial transactions at Block, the cryptocurrency company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. The investigation focuses on alleged compliance deficiencies at the company's two main units, Square and Cash App.

A former employee provided documents to prosecutors for the Southern District of New York that purported to show that insufficient information was collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risk. The documents also allege that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and that Block processed numerous cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.

Many of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not properly reported to the government. The former employee alleges that Block failed to correct company processes when alerted to these violations.

The nearly 100-page document provided to NBC News identified transactions, mostly in low-dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, until last year.

“Everything in the compliance department was flawed from top to bottom. It's run by people who shouldn't be responsible for a regulated compliance program,” the former employee told NBC News. This assessment was echoed by a second person with direct knowledge of Block's monitoring programs and practices.

“My understanding from the documents is that the deficiencies in compliance were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years,” said Edward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who represented the former employee.

In response to the inquiry, a Block spokesperson said:

&gt; “Block has a responsible and comprehensive compliance program, and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and the evolving sanctions regulatory landscape. Our compliance program includes systems, tools and processes for sanctions screening, as well as the investigation and reporting of sanctions matters in accordance with our legal obligations.” “Continuously improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block, and we are committed to improving this work as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

*   **Hong Bitcoin ETFs have recently gone live for sale.** 
*   **The investment vehicle’s debut failed to meet market expectations.**
*   **Bitcoin ETF analysts have weighed in on the asset’s first-day performance.**

The record-breaking success of [Bitcoin ETFs](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-spot-bitcoin-etf-why-is-it-important/) upon launch in the United States has sparked a global interest in the asset class. Recently launched in Hong Kong, the promise of even broader adoption has driven excitement for the launched asset, heightening hopes for impressive inflows.

However, contrary to expectations, the debut of the exchange-traded funds has not gone off to a good start.

The newly launched asset class raked in a total of $141 million on its first day of trade, Tuesday, April 20, raising questions of performance among experts. Led by issuer ChinaAMC with $123 million, the cumulative volume contrasts sharply with the forecasted $300 million before launch, falling significantly behind the U.S. record of $4.6 billion.

Weighing in on the performance, analyst James Seyffart opined that the six Hong Kong spot ETFs did not _“live up to expectations_,” significantly underperforming below the record standards set by their U.S. counterparts.

&gt; To be clear. By any reasonable \*relative\* measure for the launch of these ETFs — they were a massive success for the HK market
&gt; 
&gt; It's just that some were trying to look at what happened in the US and equate that in some way to the HK ETF market on an almost \*absolute\* basis [https://t.co/B2GKmr7L5T](https://t.co/B2GKmr7L5T)
&gt; 
&gt; — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1785306106211848280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also [reiterated](https://x.com/ericbalchunas/status/1785324704179368374?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw) a previous warning against the overhype of the newly launched asset. Factoring the market size, Balchunas emphasized that the Hong Kong market is relatively smaller compared to the US and should not be equated similarly.

However, both Seyffart and Balchunas added that the performance was significant within the local market context. They stated that ChinaAMC’s performance positions it as the 6th most successful out of 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years and in the top 20% overall in terms of launches.

The underperformance of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch has rippled through the crypto market with a downward wave.

Crypto Market Hit as Bitcoin Retraces to $50K Mark
--------------------------------------------------

Leading the major market negative shift on April 30, [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://dailycoin.com/what-is-spot-bitcoin-etf-why-is-it-important/) suffered a sharp fall below the $60,000 mark for the first time this week, dropping to the $56,000 point.

This marked a sharp 12.5% decline in the token’s price, worsening ITS week-long downward trend. [Currently trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) at $56,980, BTC is down 29.4% from its all-time high of $73,738, squashing the once-heightened optimism for an imminent bull run. 

Bitcoin was not the only asset hit. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also took major hits, falling 29.7% and 17%, respectively. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX) experienced losses within the 6% range before rebounding later with modest gains.

On Wednesday, Bitcoin sharply declined, dropping below the [crucial $60,000 support level](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-prediction-to-42000/#:~:text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20outlined,continuation%20of%20BTC's%20bull%20run.). Despite this recent market downtrend, Bitcoin investors remain confident as they believe the flagship crypto can still reach [new heights](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) in this market cycle. Some say this might be what Bitcoin needs before making another parabolic run to the upside. 

Bitcoin’s Decline Is Nothing To Be Scared Of
--------------------------------------------

Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, reassured in an X (formerly Twitter) [post](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) that Bitcoin’s recent price decline was not unusual, stating it was “pretty ordinary stuff.” He also pointed out that this was Bitcoin’s [fourth 20% correction](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/) in the past 12 months, underscoring how normal these price movements are.

Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, had [previously warned](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/) that price declines of such magnitude were to be expected, stating that “bull markets are not straight lines up.” He noted that the same thing happened in the [2021 and 2017 bull runs](https://bitcoinist.com/rewards-2021-bitcoin-bull-buyers-finally-break-even/) when Bitcoin experienced about 13 price drawdowns of over 10% or more. 

Meanwhile, [crypto analyst Rekt Capital](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-troubles-far-from-over/) claimed in an [X post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785370455706063233) that “this is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle.” He added, “The longer this goes on, the better.” In another [X post](https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1785371953940791680), he reassured his followers that Bitcoin is getting closer to its final bottom with each passing day.

Like Rekt Capital, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also sounded confident that Bitcoin’s recent decline was just a part of the bigger picture for its move to the upside. They claimed this would be the “final shakeout before up, only rally to a cycle top.”

Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of Apollo, also shared his bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, as he suggested that the crypto token’s volatility is what makes it a great investment. “Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet. Bitcoin is still the best asymmetric opportunity in the market,” he [wrote](https://x.com/thomas_fahrer/status/1785450839815147634) on X. 

Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over
---------------------------------

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez [suggested](https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1785239938381873522) that Bitcoin’s bull run was far from over while comparing Bitcoin’s current price action to the last two [halving events](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/). According to him, Bitcoin consolidated for 189 and 87 days around the halving in 2016 and 2020, respectively, before the bull run resumed.

He further noted that Bitcoin has only consolidated for 60 days this time around, meaning that the flagship crypto will continue its run eventually. In a subsequent [X post](https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1785322627696857234), the analyst stated that Bitcoin might be 538 days away from hitting its [next market top](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/) if it follows its trend from the previous two bull runs.

In a momentous event that heralds a new era for Polkadot, Kusama, its test network, sold all three cores in its first Agile Coretime sale, as reported on April 30. This achievement, shared by Parity Technologies, the developer of the interoperable blockchain, is a crucial step in their roadmap towards bringing Agile Coretime to the mainnet.

Kusama Sells All Three Cores: Beggining Of A New Era?
-----------------------------------------------------

In an [update](https://twitter.com/paritytech/status/1785634827468779739) on X, all three cores were sold on April 30, generating 70 KSM, worth approximately $1,980. Each core was sold for 23.4 KSM, or roughly $660. Buyers of each core can now produce blocks on Kusama for the next four weeks.

The [Agile Coretime](https://www.parity.io/blog/agilecoretime-explained) concept, a replacement for the parachain auction system, is a welcomed change, especially for participants eager to produce blocks or deploy protocols. In this model, participants can bid for core time, a system that promises more efficiency, as envisioned by Gavin Wood, the developer of Polkadot and Kusama. 

The goal is to accelerate the pace at which new decentralized applications (dapps) can join the network. This will also help amplify enterprise adoption of Polkadot solutions.

The Agile Coretime concept eventually replaces the previous parachain auction system, bringing a host of benefits. For instance, it eliminates the need for upfront, long-term slot commitments, as with [Parachains](https://bitcoinist.com/how-polkadots-interoperable-system-is-created-through-parachains/).

This will, in turn, help foster more flexible resource utilization, particularly for new projects. Most importantly, this model creates opportunities for early-stage ventures and individual developers to participate.

It remains to be seen when this model will go live on Polkadot. However, early success in Kusama sets the pace for the eventual integration in the coming months.

Polkadot Prepares For Asynchronous Backing, DOT Rejects Bears
-------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond this, Polkadot plans to [activate](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing) Asynchronous Backing on the mainnet in the coming weeks, an update that enables the network to process more transactions, pushing up the overall throughput. Additionally, it allows for increased block capacity and shorter block times, changes that are a net positive for the network.

With this announcement, DOT prices are stable, cementing its position in the top-20. At press time, the coin changes hands at around $6.5, rejecting bears. Notably, DOT is finding support at April 2024 lows.

Still, for bulls to take over, prices must ease past $7.5, reversing losses of April 13. This development might anchor bulls who are currently targeting March 2024 highs.

Two United States lawmakers have introduced a bill to clarify how Bitcoin[](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price) [BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)

and crypto miners are taxed over block rewards.

In an April 30 announcement, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel [said](https://ferguson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4656) they had introduced the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed legislation would specify that staking rewards would be considered created property under U.S. tax code, and taxes on block rewards would be collected at acquisition.

“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry,” said Representative Ferguson. “The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas.”

Crypto advocacy group Coin Center [described](https://www.coincenter.org/new-legislation-proposes-clear-tax-guidelines-for-crypto-block-rewards/) the bill as having “sensible policies” by taxing block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks when sold or spent rather than when they were acquired. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, [called](https://twitter.com/sheila_warren/status/1785476666367811998) the legislation “right on point” for providing needed guidance.

“\[B\]lock rewards are more appropriately classified as value creation due to a user’s actions and efforts, rather than income from an employer,” said Coin Center. “This simple policy would resolve major issues with how cryptocurrencies are taxed today and put the technology on a level playing field.” **_Related:_** [**_Solo Bitcoin miner wins the 3.125 BTC lottery, solving valid block_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solo-bitcoin-miner-solves-valid-block-post-halving)

The legislation came roughly 10 days after Bitcoin miner rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block [after the blockchain’s fourth halving](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-2024-completion-confirmed) event. Halvings have historically decreased the new supply of the cryptocurrency and eventually caused the price to surge. At the time of publication, the BTC price was $58,030, having fallen roughly 11% since the halving on April 19.

[![Image 1](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trigger-Continuation-of-Bitcoin.jpg?w=750&amp;h=375&amp;crop=1)](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trigger-Continuation-of-Bitcoin.jpg)

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is reportedly raising her price target for Bitcoin ([BTC](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) based upon an assumption of greater institutional investment in the top digital asset by market cap.

According to a new report from Benzinga, Wood’s latest [prediction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-raises-her-bitcoin-141913532.html) is that Bitcoin will soar to $3.8 million by 2030 if institutions decide to allocate slightly more than 5% of their portfolios to BTC.

The new Wood prediction, made at a New York Investor Day in March, increases her previous prediction by $2.3 million.

Says Wood,

_“Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC \[US Securities and Exchange Commission\] has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.”_ Wood is referring to the SEC approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes one operated by ARK. The ETFs, which launched in January, have attracted tens of billions of dollars in investment and are seen as the most successful launches of an ETF. The ETFs allow institutions to access Bitcoin. If Wood’s prediction turns out to be accurate, it would mean that Bitcoin would increase from its current value by more than 6,572% in about six years. Bitcoin is trading for $56,946 at time of writing, down more than 6% in the last 24 hours. ![Image 2: a pink and green screen with the words daily hold get scoop alerts](https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Get-Alerts-728x90.png)

URL Source: https://www.bankless.com/delegating-restaked-eth-on-eigenlayer

Markdown Content:
EigenLayer is on everyone's minds this week due to announcements around the much-hyped token launch. But amid all of the EIGEN talk, let's take a look at how to get started putting your restaked ETH to work!

In the [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) ecosystem, an **Actively Validated Service** (AVS) is a project that uses the security of Ethereum via EigenLayer to underpin its native functionalities.  

AVSs can be anything from data availability solutions to L2s, like optimistic or zk-rollups, and plenty more in between. 

“Operators” are the entities responsible for running these services. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the AVSs by managing the underlying nodes and operations.

Notably, AVSs expand the capabilities of Ethereum by providing scalable and efficient solutions for various blockchain applications. Operators ensure these services are reliable and secure, making them integral to the trust and functionality of the AVSs they support.

**The First AVSs on EigenLayer**
--------------------------------

![Image 1](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/JOqvtVW4R7RXyNo4oiMqq5RAiqHxd_sYqeRBLsZBkzm1kXbVUbQPkRpkUJmhK6WOAe4FhCVInnY6rdvQxNj0REj2c-mGv5UJdhlBHNV1qHaS_9a0-ql5-wO22V_7qgJaol_h-h19Cls8ODgnG9pUAGc)

In April 2024, EigenLayer started its phased rollout of the first AVSs, beginning with its own EigenDA solution. After that, [eight more services have come online](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/avs-launch/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) atop the restaking protocol. Five of the most active AVSs so far have been:

1.  [**EigenDA**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x870679e138bcdf293b7ff14dd44b70fc97e12fc0?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — A new data availability network, EigenDA boasts high throughput and low costs, ideal for scaling Ethereum's data handling capacities. _Current TVL: 2.71M ETH_
2.  [**eoracle**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x23221c5bb90c7c57ecc1e75513e2e4257673f0ef?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — A decentralized oracle network that securely integrates real-world data into Ethereum, powering various decentralized apps. _Current TVL: 1.87M ETH_
3.  [**Witness Chain**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0xd25c2c5802198cb8541987b73a8db4c9bcae5cc7?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — Coordinates decentralized physical infrastructure networks, offering a new layer of economic activities for blockchain projects. _Current TVL: 1.82M ETH_
4.  [**Brevis coChain AVS**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x9fc952bdcbb7daca7d420fa55b942405b073a89d?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — This service uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable smart contracts to access and compute vast historical blockchain data efficiently. _Current TVL: 1.30M ETH_
5.  [**AltLayer MACH**](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x71a77037870169d47aad6c2c9360861a4c0df2bf?ref=bankless.ghost.io) — Focused on providing fast finality for transactions within rollups, enhancing the speed and reliability of Ethereum-based transactions. _Current TVL: 1.29M ETH_

**Choosing an AVS and Operator**
--------------------------------

When selecting an AVS and an operator, make sure you first understand the specific services and benefits each offers. 

For example, [EigenYields](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0x5accc90436492f24e6af278569691e2c942a676d?ref=bankless.ghost.io) is one of the operators of EigenDA, and it promises to share airdrops with its delegators. While direct incentives around AVSs are scant for now, look for operators to offer more explicit rewards like this going forward. 

![Image 2](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lJd-DABW6wTswRDZvPc2gY1TyYj15wxL8D2e0LpMeSkdYojLUwSR7DPIRweyZ4uBsdvQAlO2Yg8cJeRnkahDOJ3N2IUeLtlULsEo85wC8nLUNnjS2PCaaJkdy8A2YrVegbPZ-F3CkzEjoQ33DrXKAo0)

While EigenLayer vetted its first wave of AVSs, the ecosystem is moving towards a permissionless model where operators will self-register. This means assessing the risk and potential of each operator will become increasingly important over time. 

Additionally, EigenLayer does not guarantee the fitness of any operators, and bad operators can cause slashing events for their delegators once this functionality is activated later, so performing due diligence before delegating is crucial. It also takes seven days to redelegate to another operator, so make sure you’re confident before diving in. 

**How to Delegate Restaked ETH to AVS Operators**
-------------------------------------------------

![Image 3](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/R2Z8AuGxB5PgN8NcMlynePc0zxmRopmjTvVMjopqhQOhnA6EU-PWm9Cb5vbCEVMck3woDOKthaSUlCg33_NEegTDBrWYfeuZ0HUsnmfAn-uxWFNxcYg0E2xONQ7GpXMZL4UD7nt7jhLp0VaRz-5g8A4)

1.  **Access the EigenLayer AVS Dashboard** — Navigate to [the AVS dashboard](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs?ref=bankless.ghost.io) and connect your wallet.
2.  **Select an AVS** — Review the available AVSs and select one that aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
3.  **Choose an Operator** — Each AVS has a list of operators you can click into. Select an operator based on their performance and any additional incentives they might offer.
4.  **Delegate Your Stake** — Click the "Delegate" button next to your chosen operator. You'll be prompted to confirm the delegation with your wallet. 

**That’s it, that’s all it takes to get started here!** Now just sit back while your restaked ETH is put to work. Again, remember that you can redelegate to a different operator as you please, but the process will take seven days. 

Also, be sure to stay tuned to [EigenLayer’s social accounts](https://twitter.com/eigenlayer?ref=bankless.ghost.io) about new AVSs coming online, as they may offer new opportunities or require adjustments in your delegation strategy!

URL Source: https://blockworks.co/news/vitalik-buterin-zk-proofs-more-efficient

Markdown Content:
Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a new blog post discussing a new cryptographic proving system that can make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient.

The proving system, called Binius, is designed to operate directly over binary code on computers. Binary code is a language understood by computers, and it is used to store information and represents data using the symbols zero and one, otherwise known as bits. 

Although there are some similarities between STARKs and Binius, Buterin explains that the mathematical tricks that enable these different proving systems are very different. 

Generally speaking, STARKs is a technology that has enabled complicated statements to be easily cryptographically verified. It is designed in a way that can easily compute numbers when they are of small value, when there are large values, STARKs generate extra values, which can lead to inefficiency. 

Unlike STARKs that “arithmetize” a statement into a polynomial equation — a mathematical expression which model a relationship between variables in a block — Binius treats data as a hypercube and grid, and uses multilinear polynomials to perform cryptographic proofs.

Loading Tweet..

Binius converts individual values into bits and places them in a hypercube and a square. This hypercube is then converted into a grid and computations are performed in order to receive an output matrix. 

![Image 1](https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png)

A verifier will then perform its own computational calculations to ensure that the information itself matches and ensure that the compute columns returns a value claimed by the prover.

“I highly encourage people to understand and explore! Lots of innovations have been happening in ZK-proving recently. And I expect lots more to come soon,” Buterin wrote in an [X post](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1784912152655974533).

![Image 1: a pile of one dollar bills on a white background](https://media.cryptoglobe.com/2022/09/zoomed-in-one-dollar-bill-768x576.jpg) 

According to a recent [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/business/a-strong-us-dollar-weighs-on-the-world.html) by Joe Rennison and Karl Russell for The New York Times (NYT), the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength against nearly every major currency in the world this year. The Times reports that two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, largely due to expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

The article explains that high Fed rates, a response to persistent inflation, have made American assets more attractive to investors worldwide. As a result, money has been flowing into the United States, creating ripple effects felt by policymakers, politicians, and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo.

The Times highlights the far-reaching consequences of a strong dollar, including intensified inflation abroad, higher interest bills for countries that have borrowed in dollars, and potential benefits for foreign businesses exporting to the U.S. However, the article also notes that American companies selling abroad may be put at a disadvantage, potentially widening the U.S. trade deficit.

The impact of the dollar’s strength, as reported by The New York Times, depends on the underlying reasons for high U.S. interest rates. If rates remain elevated due to stubborn inflation despite slowing economic growth, policymakers worldwide may face a difficult choice between supporting their domestic economies or bolstering their currencies.

The article emphasizes that Asia has been particularly affected by the strong dollar, with the Japanese yen and Korean won reaching multi-year lows. The Times also points out that China has allowed the yuan to weaken, raising questions about the strength of its economy.

Per the NYT article, European policymakers are considering cutting rates but must be mindful of the potential impact on the euro’s value relative to the dollar. The article also notes that central banks in South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia are grappling with similar challenges.

Markdown Content:
Bitcoin price crashed between April 30 and May 1, with its price decreasing by 11.5% to $56,522. This downturn triggered $172 million in leveraged long position liquidations, which is notably low given that Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) futures open interest was at $28.9 billion before the price crash. Consequently, it would be simplistic to assume that bulls were taken by surprise.

Uncertainty should drop after the Fed minutes publish
-----------------------------------------------------

Some analysts believe that investors are in a holding pattern until Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, concludes his speech following the two-day monetary council meeting on May 1. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will maintain interest rates at 5.25%, there is considerable skepticism regarding the U.S. Treasury Department’s ability to finance the government’s budget.

On April 30, the yield on the U.S. Treasury two-year note climbed to its highest level in five months, reaching 5.06%, as investors sought higher returns to offset increased risk following the announcement of a $1.07 trillion deficit for the first half of 2024. Since the Fed’s rate hikes throughout 2023, interest expenses on the deficit have risen by 23% in the first half of 2024 and are projected to continue to rise as long as rates remain elevated.

Bitcoin is not alone in facing declines: Worsening macroeconomic conditions have made investors more risk-averse. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks mid- and small-cap U.S.-listed companies, fell by 8.2% over the last 30 days, wiping out gains from the previous two months. Similarly, WTI oil prices have dropped 8.3% since April 5, when they reached a five-month peak of $87.91.

A key indication that Bitcoin’s price correction may be reaching a bottom stems from the traditional markets, following a series of robust first-quarter corporate earnings reports from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, TSMC, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays. A temporary recovery in the stock market shifts investor focus away from Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, although traders may seek alternatives if the Fed decides to maintain higher rates for an extended period.

Bitcoin miner capitulation FUD and strong crypto influx in China
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin miners are under significant strain after the April 20 halving, which reduced their rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC per block. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, mentioned that estimates of miners’ outflows to exchanges show [no signs of capitulation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-signs-bitcoin-miner-capitulation-despite-plummeting-revenue-cryptoquant) “for now.” Young Ju added that if the Bitcoin price downtrend “stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of Bitcoin.”

Thus, another sign that Bitcoin’s downturn may be nearing its end is the steadfastness of miners, which remain reluctant to sell despite a 57% drop in the Hashrate Index, as [reported](https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index) by Luxor Technology. This metric assesses the daily expected return of one terahash of hashing power, factoring in network difficulty, Bitcoin’s price and transaction fees.

To understand the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, examining the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly for USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)), can be enlightening. The premium on USDC transactions over the official U.S. dollar rate offers insight into retail investors’ activities, indicating whether they are moving into or out of cryptocurrency markets.

On May 1, the premium for USDC in China increased to 2.7%, signifying a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. This sustained interest points to a positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in China, bolstering an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, which recently saw a 20% decline in price over three weeks.

However, despite potential improvements in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s notes and the realization that fears of miner capitulation are, thus far, unfounded, the situation in U.S. markets shows a different trend. Specifically, net outflows from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million in the past five trading days.

Such findings suggest that investment flows are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price movements, with no certainty that the $56,500 support level will hold.

URL Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/developer-awarded-250k-by-curve-finance/

Markdown Content:
Cryptocurrency and [DeFi](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/) protocols have faced increasing problems due to vulnerabilities and resultant loss of funds. As the problems have continued, those identifying it have contributed to the benefit of the cause of decentralized finance. In a big discovery, a cybersecurity expert identified a vulnerability in Curve Finance protocol which could be used for withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

Cryptocurrency protocols and vulnerability 
-------------------------------------------

There has been an estimate of losses [amounting to $758 million](https://de.fi/blog/de-fi-rekt-report-over-758m-lost-in-q3-2023) due to vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols in Q3 of 2023. There have been a staggering 116 cases which show that there is an urgent need for enhancement of security. A workforce needs to be deployed for this purpose to identify vulnerabilities and address problems. 

In a recent discovery, Curve Finance protocol has identified a vulnerability in the DeFi system. The vulnerability is of historical importance as it has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for years. The vulnerability has resulted in hackers’ access to the protocol’s liquidity pool and drawing out funds. 

There have been a range of security attacks in 2023 and major areas of focus for hackers included smart contract vulnerabilities, reentry attacks, and Oracle manipulation attacks. The first one is of critical importance because if a hacker is able to identify a vulnerability, they can use it for negative purposes, affecting the funds and security of the protocol.  

Claim of a key vulnerability in [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/) and other protocols came from a cybersecurity expert Marc Croc. Belonging to Kupia security, Marc Croc said that the vulnerability resulted in the loss of funds from the liquidity pool. The mentioned cybersecurity expert also added that it has led to the loss of millions from various protocols. 

Reentrancy Vulnerability in Curve Finance
-----------------------------------------

Reenetracy vulnerability was verified by the developers’ team from [Curve Finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/curve-finance-defi-lending-contracts/). In a detailed overview, they were able to identify and confirm it. According to official sources, the bug could manipulate the balances of a DeFi protocol. The manipulation of balances could also result in the withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.

&gt; Big thanks for the disclosure! Grieving attacks are not as dangerous (funds would be anyway recoverable, and no profit for attacker) – could have caused serious panic if happened.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an example of a very professional work
&gt; 
&gt; — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1785406648082997532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

According to Curve Protocol sources, the bug didn’t pose an existential threat but it could create panic if any such incident took place. Furthermore, the company believed that they could recover funds in case such an incident took place. In July Curve Finance was able to recover funds amounting to $62 million which had been stolen after a vulnerability was exposed to hackers. 

Furthermore, the protocol members agreed to return assets valuing $49.2 million to liquidity providers. It announced the recovery of ETH assets, CRV, and other assets that were recovered by whitehat hackers. 

Curve protocol has brought forward a proposal the community fund will supply CRV tokens. The attackers identified a vulnerability in the Vyper language where problems were found in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0.

Developer rewarded $250K
------------------------

It was a critical problem that would have created problems for the development team because of the increased panic amongst the users and investors. To face the problem promptly, a cybersecurity expert identified the problem, not revealing their identity. 

&gt; 🐞I reported a vulnerability in [@CurveFinance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and I am thrilled to share that I've been awarded a bug bounty of $250,000. 🧵
&gt; 
&gt; — Marco Croc (@malicator) [April 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/malicator/status/1785376170608922675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Once the problem was confirmed, the protocol awarded the whitehat maximum bug bounty of $250K. The whitehat shared the details in the X thread, thanking Curve Finance. Furthermore, the account shared the details of how the vulnerability would affect the protocol. 

Conclusion
----------

In a recent tweet from a whitehat cybersecurity expert, Marc Croc announced the discovery of a vulnerability in Curve Finance. The development team confirmed and addressed the problem, announcing a bounty amount of $250K for the mentioned whitehat. Though the problem wasn’t an existential threat, it would have created a panic.

Markdown Content:
Just a few months ago, most economists expected the Federal Reserve to kick start rate cuts by May. All signs pointed to this: the fight against inflation appeared to be coming to an end, jobs data promised a cooling labor market on the horizon, and consumer confidence began to falter. 

Fast forward to May’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and the hopes of a rate cut in the first half of 2024 are quickly diminishing. Indeed, it appears likely the Fed will hold rates where they are for much longer than anyone could have imagined back in January. Some market commentators even think we're stuck with “higher for longer” until 2025, despite the pressure of an imminent presidential election.

Whether rates stay put until September or next January, the May FOMC meeting was certainly a far cry from December 2023, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell first mentioned rate cuts, sending markets into a frenzy. Now, we're seeing a much more hawkish committee, resolute in its restrictive monetary policy stance in the face of stubborn inflation and a labor market that refuses to stumble.

**_Related:_** [**_The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halving_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/runes-protocol-ignite-new-season-bitcoin-after-halving)

But while disappointing for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, the Fed's stance shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who follows economic data. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — [the PCE index](https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-trades-deep-discount-after-halving-5-things-bitcoin-this-week) — rose to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in February. The CPI index has remained similarly sticky, rising again from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March.

This has been fuelled by rampant spending, with consumers preferring to take on more debt rather than tighten their belts. In fact, the savings rate in the U.S. has continuously declined from 4.1% in January to just 3.2% in March, while household debt levels keep beating previous records. On top of this, unemployment has failed to edge higher. The jobless rate fell from 3.9% in February to 3.8% in March, hovering around historic lows.

So, even though the economy is beginning to slow — first-quarter GDP growth surprised on the downside, coming in at 1.6% against expectations of 2.4% - we're still a long way from the economic slowdown that would warrant stimulus in the form of rate cuts. Indeed, Powell has always been clear that the Fed's monetary policy decisions will be driven by data, and data alone. And the data simply doesn't support a looser stance, yet.

As expected, the markets have been taking this disappointment badly. Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) was hovered between $60,000 and $65,000 in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting, and global stock markets were subdued as expectations of a hawkish pivot mounted. Conversely, the dollar strengthened, battering other global currencies like the yen, which fell to the lowest level against the dollar since 1990. Other emerging market currencies can be expected to follow.

And the bad news is that we're likely stuck with this picture for a good few months. This will be a real anticlimax for those who expected the Bitcoin halving to drive a bullish breakout to a new all-time high. After some rampant price action over recent months, no one is ready for another extended period of sideways trading. It’s akin to the lights going on at the nightclub when the party is just getting started.

**_Related:_** [**_Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchains_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-illustrates-dark-side-monolithic-blockchains)

As long as the Fed holds rates steady, though, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a tight range — below $70,000 — barring any major global disasters causing a flight to safety. So far this year, Bitcoin hasn’t really cared about macroeconomics — it shrugged off the last few inflation announcements. But the Fed’s stance will have a more profound effect. The reality is that BTC is now deeply embedded in traditional financial markets thanks to spot ETFs, so it will most likely mimic the behavior of other risk assets until rates begin coming down.

So, thanks to Jerome Powell, we’re in for a boring summer that will truly test investors’ patience. That's not to say there won't be another Bitcoin party — it's coming, and it will likely rival or perhaps even surpass what we've already seen this year. Over the longer term, the Bitcoin investment thesis remains intact. Indeed, while Powell's renewed hawkishness is buoying the U.S. dollar for now, it's only a matter of time until the Fed finally pulls the plug, causing renewed dollar weakness.

Once the greenback begins its slide, Bitcoin will provide refuge from currency devaluation. Then, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs will truly come into their own, and those who can hold on to their assets and wait out the drought will be rewarded. Until then, perhaps it's not such a bad idea to leave investment portfolios alone and go enjoy the summer.

*   **Tether reports a Q1 net profit of $4.52 billion.**
*   **Gains come from treasury holdings and Bitcoin and Gold.**
*   **Treasuries enable Tether to make substantial profits.** 

Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of [USDT](https://dailycoin.com/stablecoins/tether-usdt/), the biggest stablecoin in the world, had often [found itself in controversy](https://dailycoin.com/tether-usdt-a-giant-with-feet-of-clay/). These largely stemmed from the transparency of its reserves, which often came under question. 

Since then, Tether has started to take transparency more seriously. Its latest report breaks down the company’s assets, including its significant profits. 

On Wednesday, May 1, Tether Holdings Limited released its [financial report](https://t.co/K7eFBQ6aAQ) for the first quarter of 2024, showing a record net profit of $4.52 billion. According to the attestation by the accounting firm BDO, the largest share, $1 billion, came from US Treasuries. 

The remainder came from the increase in the value of Bitcoin and gold, which Tether owns in large quantities. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price was $42,280 and has since shot up significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $57,329. Moreover, gold has significantly increased over the same period, going from $2070 per ounce to $2300. 

![Image 4: A chart breaking down Tether's reserves.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20945'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Tether’s considerable Bitcoin and gold holdings contributed substantially to its profits. According to the attestation, Tether’s total reserves are $115.41 billion, with the largest portion, $90.87 billion, in U.S. Treasuries. 

Why Tether Holds So Much Bonds
------------------------------

Tether’s bonds offer a liquid asset that is easily convertible to cash, enabling the company to meet eventual withdrawal demands. However, unlike cash reserves, US Treasury bonds provide a return on investment. This means Tether can profitably from them while exposing itself to relatively little risk.  

In addition to bonds, Tether holds $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents. These are highly liquid assets that fulfill immediate redemption requirements. 

In addition to treasury bonds and cash, Tether also holds $5.37 billion in Bitcoin and $3.65 billion in Gold. Notably, Tether issues a gold-backed stablecoin, which explains its substantial gold holdings. 

On the Flipside
---------------

*   **Despite Tether’s reports,** [**questions**](https://dailycoin.com/tethers-usdt-approaches-historic-ath-market-cap-milestone/) **about its reserve transparency still persist among the crypto community.** 
*   **Tether has recently been expanding** [**beyond stablecoins**](https://dailycoin.com/whats-behind-tethers-expansive-vision-beyond-stablecoins/)**, including into venture capital, big data, and AI.** 

Why This Matters
----------------

Tether’s recent financial outcomes and the management of its reserves have broad implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting perceptions of USDT’s stability and reliability.

Markdown Content:
According to a [report](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-nyc-hush-money-trial-resume-with-bankers-testimony-2024-04-30/) by Reuters, Judge Juan Merchan has fined former U.S. President Donald Trump $9,000 for contempt of court during his ongoing criminal hush money trial, warning that incarceration could follow if Trump continues to breach the gag order. The fine, issued on Tuesday, was for Trump’s violation of the gag order, which restricts him from making public comments about trial witnesses and participants. Trump was penalized $1,000 for each of nine comments he made online that the judge found in violation of this order.

Justice Merchan, overseeing the trial, expressed concerns that the fine might not sufficiently deter Trump, given his substantial wealth, and noted his own limitations in imposing a higher penalty. The judge emphasized the necessity of upholding the integrity of the court’s orders and indicated a willingness to consider jail as a further measure if Trump persists in his violations.

The cited comments included an article shared by Trump labeling his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness in the trial, as a “serial liar.” Another contentious post cited a claim about “undercover liberal activists” attempting to infiltrate the jury. Merchan dismissed Trump’s defense that he should not be held accountable for content he reposted but did not originally write.

A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Thursday, where additional penalties for other statements may be discussed. Merchan also demanded the removal of the offending posts from Trump’s Truth Social platform and his campaign website.

In a response on Truth Social, Trump decried the actions as an infringement on his free speech and denounced the trial as “rigged.” His attorney, Todd Blanche, argued the posts were legitimate responses to political attacks, yet failed to provide evidence of any provocation by the witnesses involved.

The developments occur amid Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting his charges of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment meant to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter. Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty.

According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/arts/television/late-night-trump-contempt.html) by The New York Times (NYT), the $9,000 gag order violation fine prompted late-night comedians to seize the opportunity for some lighthearted jabs at Trump’s expense.

Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” playfully questioned the significance of the $9,000 fine for a successful businessman like Trump:

“I know $9,000 might not seem like a lot to a successful businessman, but what about to Trump?”

However, he quickly followed up with a more serious note, mentioning that the judge lamented the legal limit on the fine and warned that if Trump continues to violate the gag order, jail time may become a necessary punishment. Colbert quipped, “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump, but I need it.”

On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the host took a different approach, arguing that the situation seemed unfair to Trump. Kimmel pointed out the irony of the trial being about Trump paying a woman to be quiet, only to now face fines for not being quiet himself. He jokingly compared the situation to Jesus, a carpenter, being nailed to a cross, and urged his audience to “think about it” and “read about it in your Trump-brand Bibles.”

Kimmel also poked fun at the judge’s warning that continued gag order violations could result in Trump being locked up. He imagined Trump’s wife, Melania, encouraging her husband not to let the judge dictate his actions.

The comedians didn’t stop there. Kimmel took a jab at Trump’s spending habits, suggesting that the former president could easily spend $9,000 at a Wendy’s drive-through. Jimmy Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show,” joined in, imagining Trump’s response to the fine: “But I get the 10th one free, right?”

“Bitcoin is not only the oldest blockchain but also continues to have the highest liquidity,” Ankr wrote. “Unfortunately, this liquidity has traditionally been trapped within the Bitcoin L1. With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols. This enables users on the Bitcoin network to earn additional staking rewards while providing other ecosystems access to Bitcoin liquidity.”

To engage in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), users first delegate their BTC to an operator in a restaking protocol, which is then used as collateral for Ankr to create BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In the case of Talus, the Bitcoin LSTs can be used to power the blockchain’s smart agents or AI assistants and their applications, such as “booking travel, making purchases online, and managing portfolios.”

Smart agents on Talus are also capable of bundling multilayer atomic swaps and executing them in one single transaction to provide security exploits such as flash loan attacks. “Ankr’s BTC liquid staking unlocks a massive amount of liquidity to ensure that smart agents on Talus can execute simultaneous DeFi transactions like atomic swaps seamlessly,” Talus commented. 

The move comes after Ankr [revealed](https://www.ankr.com/blog/ankr-btc-liquid-staking-everything-you-need-to-know/) its first Bitcoin liquid staking product in early March in conjunction with the Babylon protocol. The project allows users to “earn yields from their idle bitcoins in a secure way” by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral to mint LSTs that can be used to validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains. 

Yields earned from the staked LSTs are then funneled back to users’ locked Bitcoin. Currently, the Babylon protocol is in its testnet phase, with a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year. 

Despite an ongoing market correction, the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem has been thriving over the past year with the invention of new protocols such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Atomicals and Runes.

One such project, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, has [accumulated a total value locked of $700 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-defi-ecosystem-thrives-market) from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin and BNB Smart Chain. In a statement to Cointelegraph, SolvBTC claimed that the protocol recently surpassed 10,000 BTC staked and attracted “over 92,000 participants” shortly after its launch earlier this month.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its dog-themed branding, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in whale activity, indicating significant movements of large SHIB tokens. This surge comes after SHIB’s price decline of over 10% over the last seven days.

Whale activity, often a key indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, saw a staggering 268% increase in the case of Shiba Inu. [Large transaction volume](https://zycrypto.com/0-0001-shib-price-tsunami-looks-near-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-massive-transaction-spike/), typically involving transactions worth more than $100,000, surged to $98.12 million within 24 hours.

This surge highlights a significant uptick in whale activity, suggesting that large holders of SHIB tokens are actively buying or selling.

**Dramatic Increase in SHIB Large Transactions**
------------------------------------------------

According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions in Shiba Inu saw a dramatic increase from 1.07 trillion SHIB on April 28 to 4.17 trillion SHIB on April 29. This substantial spike in large transactions indicates that whales in the SHIB market have been particularly active, possibly taking advantage of the price dip.

SHIB has still been down by 12.05% over the past seven days. This divergence between whale activity and price performance suggests a complex interplay of factors driving SHIB’s market dynamics.

**Shiba Inu Ecosystem Key Developments**
----------------------------------------

In other [developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem](https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-beckons-as-shib-devs-aim-to-go-big-with-upcoming-shibarium-update/), the Shiba Eternity collectible card game (CCG) has undergone significant upgrades. The latest version, 1.2.7, introduces enhancements to improve player interaction and strategic depth.

Notable changes include improvements to the social menu, making players connect easier, and adjustments to fighter mechanics, providing a more balanced gameplay experience. Specifically, these fighters have been tweaked to no longer inflict debuff damage on adjacent friendly fighters upon being destroyed.

ShibaSwap, the project’s decentralized exchange (DEX), is expanding to support Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. This move enhances security and interoperability, offering users a seamless trading experience.

Adding to Shiba Inu’s excitement, the SHIB/JPY trading pair has been listed on Binance Japan. This listing opens up new trading opportunities for SHIB holders, further expanding the coin’s reach and accessibility in the Japanese market.

In conclusion, Shiba Inu’s recent surge in whale activity and ecosystem developments paint a dynamic picture of the coin’s evolving market landscape.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting by keeping interest rates unchanged, maintaining the target range at 5.25% to 5.5%. This decision was widely anticipated by market participants and came as a relief to investors, who had been closely monitoring the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.

According to a [report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/fed-meeting-today-live-updates-on-may-fed-rate-decision.html) by CNBC, during the post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided insights into the Fed’s decision-making process and its outlook for the future. Powell emphasized that the central bank’s rate decisions are not influenced by political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He stressed the importance of focusing on getting the economics right and stated that considering political factors would reduce the likelihood of achieving that goal.

Powell also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction process, known as quantitative tightening (QT). He clarified that the decision to slow the pace of reducing the balance sheet is not intended to provide accommodation to the economy or be less restrictive. Instead, the move aims to ensure a smooth process and avoid financial market turmoil, drawing lessons from the previous instance of balance sheet reduction.

When asked about the possibility of the U.S. entering a period of “stagflation,” characterized by slowing economic growth and persistent inflation, Powell downplayed these concerns. He pointed out that, by some measures, economic growth is at 3%, and inflation is below 3%, suggesting that the current economic environment does not fit the definition of stagflation.

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Powell’s remarks was his indication that it is unlikely the next policy move will be a rate hike. This statement prompted a rally in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all initially experiencing sharp gains. Powell’s comments provided reassurance to investors who had been anticipating a potential pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle.

Powell also acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has not yet gained “greater confidence” in the trajectory of inflation this year. He stated that the central bank is prepared to maintain the current target federal funds rate for as long as necessary until there is persuasive evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% target.

While the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, the central bank’s cautious tone and willingness to remain patient in the face of uncertain economic conditions have provided some comfort to market participants. As investors digest the implications of the Fed’s latest meeting, attention will now turn to upcoming economic data releases, particularly those related to the labor market and inflation, which will help shape expectations for future monetary policy decisions.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), XRP as well as several other altcoins turned green during a [speech](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1785745563515834870) by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Powell dismissed market concerns about "stagflation," a scenario in which slow economic growth is coupled with high inflation. He said that he did not see "the stag or the flation."

Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon amplified stagflation concerns, warning that the US economy might be heading back to the 1970s. 

In response to Powell's speech, American businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach said that he expects only a single rate cut this year. He doesn't see a rate cut coming this June. The Fed chair himself has stated that it would be hard to predict how the rates are going to change, but he has predicted that the next policy move is unlikely to be a cut. 

[card](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays)According to Powell, rate cuts could come sooner due to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. However, the decision will still hinge on the incoming inflation data. Powell has stressed that the Fed is now satisfied with inflation staying at 3%. The Fed's goal is to bring inflation back to 2% before it would be able to start cutting rates. 

Interest rate futures are [betting](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1785746107055657129) on a single rate cut in 2024. The first rate cut is expected to occur in September. 

The cryptocurrency market has been [hit hard](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-plunging-in-tandem-with-nvidia-and-other-ai-plays) by the Fed's U-turn, with Bitcoin logging its worst monthly candle since August 2023. The Fed was previously predicted to implement at least three rate cuts this year.
