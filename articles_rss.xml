This isn’t going to be another op-ed about how silly it is for celebrities to do cryptocurrency ads. We all know that they don’t age well.
Instead, what I’d like to opine on is why a cryptocurrency ad with Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, falls flat in particular. If you’re going to put a celebrity in your crypto ad, you need to go all out with creativity, humor or just overall entertainment value. Eminem’s new crypto ad does none of that — it has almost nothing to do with the rapper, or crypto at all.
The rapper’s voiceover on an advertisement for Crypto.com aired during the Lakers NBA play-off game last week. The ad itself, just a minute long, shows a nameless, faceless boxer getting ready to face-off in a match at the Crypto.com Arena. You can hear Eminem’s voice saying empty platitudes of encouragement in the background, telling the audience to enjoy the moment, before the screen shows the somewhat infamous slogan, “Fortune favors the brave.”
I say infamous, because Matt Damon’s 2022 Crypto.com SuperBowl commercial — where the Oscar-nominated actor was actually pictured on screen saying that catchphrase out loud — just looked so silly in the wake of the FTX crash. Damon later gave an awkward, pause-filled red carpet interview, noting that he only did the commercial to support his water non-profit in a down year.
Some are already speculating that Eminem’s main motivation to lend his voice to Crypto.com’s latest ad is part of a marketing push for his upcoming album. But his motivations for being crypto’s latest celebrity spokesperson aren’t important. What’s important is how soulless that advertisement is. Watching the commercial for the first time as a longtime Eminem stan, I lamented all of the missed opportunities staring me in the face.

For one, this is far from Eminem’s first foray into crypto — he had his own, pretty cringey Bored Ape phase at the peak of the NFT boom, culminating in a half-animated BAYT music video with none other than Snoop Dogg. That was terrible, and also funny: and Crypto.com’s pretty basic ad could have benefitted from any sort of creative reference to Eminem’s actual crypto interests. 
Granted, Crypto.com is not an NFT platform. That doesn’t mean that you aren’t allowed to have a sense of humor — especially when creating a likely very expensive advertisement with a very famous, previously NFT-obsessed rapper.
Which brings me to my second point — there’s no rap. Paying Eminem to remain faceless and read a short, only slightly rhyming text over a black-and-white boxing video feels like paying Bob Dylan to promote Victoria’s Secret.
Eminem’s crypto ad isn’t the first since the unfortunate crypto Super Bowl. Both Coinbase and Greyscale also put out slightly more entertaining ads in the lead up to the Bitcoin halving, albeit celebrity-less ones. 
As I said at the top, my point here isn’t to convince the world that celebrities in crypto ads are setting themselves up for future embarrassment, loss of money and even potentially SEC fines. We already know that. And I also know that no one will stop crypto companies, especially during a bull market, from paying celebrities tons of money to promote their brands anyway. Sam Bankman-Fried set that precedent, and even with him in jail, it really shows no signs of abating.
Instead, I’d like to propose that if we are going to keep having celeb-studded crypto ads — make them really sparkle. Pay Eminem to write an entire song about trading on Crypto.com and release it alongside his new album, with a specially crypto-themed music video (he already has the experience). Get JoJo Siwa to wrap another car with whatever memecoin logo, or Brooklyn Beckham to tattoo Dogecoin eyes next to his tattoo of his wife’s eyes.
Celebrity crypto ads, in my opinion, should only exist if they do something really creative or really silly: In other words, make them match the whimsy and creativity of this burgeoning financial tech industry. I’m not sure that any SEC lawyers would agree with me. Good thing I don’t work for the SEC.
Otherwise, make celebrity crypto endorsements illegal for all of the obvious reasons (high potential for securities fraud and misleading investors to start). In a nutshell — go silly or go home.

I don’t care much about tech, I don’t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that’s why I’ve ended up in crypto. But because I’m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about — finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda — I’m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.That’s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.It’s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.If you want to talk crypto with me, let’s go off topic.

Bitcoin and Solana non-fungible token (NFT) market registered records in daily active traders (DAT) last week, according to the research blog OurNetwork. While Solana reached its all-time high of 59,300 DAT, Bitcoin registered a peak of 25,600 DAT.Solana’s rising DAT number represents a fourfold increase from the approximately 15,000 daily traders earlier last week. The publication attributes this growth to the influx of wallets engaging in sub-$10 transactions on platforms like Magic Eden and Tensor. Over the past week, Magic Eden has captured a significant 74% of Solana’s trading volume market share and 38% of its trader market share, while Tensor has secured 18% of the volume and a dominant 61% of traders.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s NFT trading historical peak was attributed to the anticipation of the Runes protocol launch. However, the trader count experienced a sharp decline to around 7,000 the day following the launch. Magic Eden has been the primary hub for Bitcoin’s NFT activity, commanding 82% of both active traders and trading volume over the last seven days, with OKX trailing at 16% for the same metrics.Image: OurNetwork/NFTpulseEthereum still reigns, but numbers declineDespite dominating in trading volume and daily active traders, Ethereum’s weekly NFT trader numbers have been in decline over the past two years, with less than 36,000 wallets engaging in trades last week. OurNetwork points out that this is a significant drawdown compared to the 218,000 seen in April 2022.Similarly, the weekly volume has plummeted from the $1.4 billion peak last April to approximately $100 million per day currently.Moreover, the Ethereum NFT landscape also shows changes when it comes to marketplace dominance. OpenSea and Blur rivalry was met by the rise of Magic Eden as a competitor since its Ethereum marketplace debut in February. Magic Eden has quickly garnered over 20% of Ethereum’s NFT volume in the last week alone.Image: OurNetwork/Dune AnalyticsAlthough Blur maintains a majority share with over 50% volume, OpenSea’s presence has diminished to 13.5% in the recent seven-day period. Yet, OpenSea still leads in trader count on Ethereum, attracting about 4,000 traders daily, compared to Blur’s 2,500 and Magic Eden’s under 600. Over the last two years, OpenSea has seen a dramatic 90% drop in its weekly trader base.On the significant trades side, a transaction on the CryptoPunks NFT marketplace involved a 4,000 ETH purchase, valued at over $12 million, for a highly coveted alien punk. This sale propelled CryptoPunks to the second-highest platform by volume on Ethereum for that day, with only Blur surpassing it with $15.2 million in volume.

                            Bitcoin has finally broken below the $60,000 support level for the first time in two months. The world’s largest digital asset has largely been in a euphoria phase since the beginning of the year, particularly after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. However, the current consolidation of the price of Bitcoin indicates the euphoria might be fading. 
According to a new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin, which has been active for the past 6.5 months, looks to be fading. At the same time, the BTC distribution has entered into the fear zone and investors are now heavily weighted towards selling.
Selling Pressure Rises
After reaching an all-time high of over $73,737 in March 2024, Bitcoin has declined by more than 18% as investors take profits. This drop in price has been accompanied by a rise in the percentage of addresses holding losses, indicating increased selling pressure. The percentage of addresses making a profit has fallen in tandem from over 99% to 86% at the time of writing.

On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in its recent report the consolidation action. According to the Net Unrealized Profit &amp; Loss (NUPL) metric, Bitcoin has been in a euphoria mode very early in this cycle when compared to past cycles. Notably, the NUPL crossed over 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the just concluded halving amidst hype about Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
This is in comparison to the 2021 market cycle, where the NUPL was triggered into a profit zone 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving. This metric suggests the market is still in its euphoria phase for the last seven months but has cooled off significantly due to correction in the past two months.
Interestingly, the report noted a “distinct uptick in net outflows” across all wallet sizes throughout April, indicating the current sentiment among traders. This means traders are now in a sell-side pressure across the board. Furthermore, a majority of short-term (one week to one month) holders have been posting losses on the 90-day +1sd level since March.

What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?
While the “fear” rating may worry investors, a pullback after such a steep price rise is considered healthy by most crypto analysts. Many long-term holders are still holding strong and are waiting for the halving effect to kick in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,899 and is down by 5.35% in the past 24 hours.

Considering the current cost-basis for short-term holders (STH) is at $66,700, and their realized price is at $59,800, many more holders in this cohort have possibly entered into the loss zone. 
According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, $59,800 is a key price level to watch, as history has shown Bitcoin tends to bounce over the STH realized price.

Vitalik Buterin uses a multi-sig wallet for 90% of his crypto to enhance security.



He recommended a multi-sig solution to minimize the personal risks of hardware wallets. 



In a multi-sig solution, users hold some keys but are insufficient to recover the funds independently.




Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has explained why as much as 90% of his personal crypto funds are secured through a multi-signature hardware wallet solution. Buterin revealed this information while commenting on a trend urging crypto users to migrate to hardware wallet solutions.



Crypto data analyst Kofi sparked the conversion by painting a scenario where crypto users woke up one day and discovered their investments had been stolen. Notably, stories of devastating losses are rampant in the crypto scene, particularly as the bull market gains momentum. 



As crypto enthusiasts participate in airdrop activities and other endeavors, they become susceptible to bad actors who create similar but fraudulent activities intended to steal their seed phrase to ultimately drain their wallets.



Renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT recently uncovered that the Lazarus Group orchestrated over 25 crypto hacks to launder $200 million. On the other hand, security firm CertiK disclosed that the crypto community witnessed exploits worth $21 million in April, often involving hacks and wallet drainers.



While utilizing a hardware wallet solution could prevent some of these exploits, the founder of the NFT trading platform Reservoir contends that the primary risk shifts to the users themselves. The risks include forgetting or losing the seed phrase, especially if it is hidden too well or stored in a bank safety deposit box and becomes inaccessible due to sudden relocation.



In response, Vitalik Buterin noted that the cited concerns are precisely why he opted for a multisig service like Safe for over 90% of his personal funds. 







He explained that multi-sig setups, where multiple keys are required for transactions but not all held by the user, provide an added layer of security.  Typically, some keys are held by the user, but not enough to independently recover the funds. The remaining keys are entrusted to other individuals whom one trusts.



“Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.” Buterin concluded.

Politicians regale their voting base during election years with new promises and policy shifts. This time, the Biden admin announced intent to loosen up marijuana rules on a federal level. Specifically, to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III substance, following half a century of it being classified as Schedule I (ecstasy, heroin, LSD) substance.



This would place the recreational plant among less controversial drugs, such as anabolic steroids, phendimetrazine for appetite suppression, or codeine for pain relief. According to sources familiar to NBC News, the DEA is expected to approve the opinion delivered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency responsible for the reclassification.



Predictably, the announcement sparked a resurgence in weed stocks. Laboring between regulatory walls and black market competition, marijuana companies have had trouble erecting sustainable profitability. But accounting for the recent investment spike, AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS), tracking 25 marijuana stocks, is now up 47% year-to-date.



The question is, which cannabis stocks have established themselves in the current regulatory regime, making them well-suited to prosper in a more lax environment?



Cronos Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRON)



Based in Toronto, Canada, Cronos Group has been busy building its cannabis-powered portfolio of brands. These are divided into three categories – mainstream (Spinach), medicinal (PeaceNaturals), and premium (Lord Jones). In addition to Canada, Cronos sources its products from Israel, Australia, and Germany.



Cronos Group concluded fiscal year 2023 with a net loss of $70.4 million, a 55% improvement from the net loss of $155.17 million in 2022. Moreover, the company reported $862 million in cash and cash equivalents while having zero debt. Cronos is also the beneficiary of the heavy weight Altria, having invested $1.8 billion in Cronos in 2019.



The group is scheduled to report its Q1 2024 earnings on May 9th. At the present price level of $2.94, the CRON penny stock is 44% above its 52-week low point of $1.64 per share. Per Nasdaq’s aggregated forecast data twelve months ahead, the average CRON price target is $2.42 per share.



Of course, this doesn’t account for the new investor resurgence and the inherent penny stock volatility. The next earnings report will likely set the tone for CRON investor sentiment for the rest of the year.





Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC)



Having established a global marijuana presence across popular brands Tweed, Tokyo Smoke, Spectrum Therapeutics, and Houseplant, Canopy is the most performant cannabis stock. Year-to-date, CGC has gained 114% value, exiting the penny stock territory at $10.80 per share.



In February, the Canadian company reported a 7% year-over-year revenue decline for Q3 FY24. From a massive net loss of CAD$2.6 billion in 2022, Canopy Growth made the most significant 78% improvement to CAD$583.4 million net loss in 2023. The company’s cash and equivalents depleted from CAD$598.1 million to CAD$142.7 million during the period.



On the upside, Canopy Growth halved its total liabilities from CAD$1.6 billion to CAD$815 million. The CGC stock had its 52-week low of $2.75 per share. Per Nasdaq, the average CGC price target is $3.45, making it highly overbought.



Nonetheless, the investor interest in growth stocks indicates that CGC shares will be the primary beneficiaries of further inflows following inevitable price corrections.







Curaleaf Holdings (NASDAQ: CURLF)



Standing out from the Canadian cannabis crowd, Curaleaf is an American company based in New York. The firm holds a presence in 17 states across 145 local dispensaries. Recently, on April 22nd, Curaleaf acquired Northern Green Canada (NGC), known for its penetration of the EU market via EU-GMP certification. NGC had a foothold in Australia and New Zealand, paving the road for Curaleaf’s international cannabis presence.



Curaleaf is also scheduled to report Q1 2024 earnings on May 9th. Following the conclusion of fiscal year 2023, Curaleaf claims to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with a 1.9x debt load to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which was reported at $83 million in Q4.



Curaleaf International tracked 63% year-over-year revenue growth of $18 million and expects further gains in Czechia, the UK, Germany (via the recently passed Cannabis Act “CanG”), Poland, and Switzerland. Europe’s total addressable market for Curaleaf and other cannabis companies is $248 billion.



Curaleaf concluded 2023 with $588 total debt and $92 million in cash. The company ended 2023 with a $290.3 million net loss vs a $376.9 million net loss in 2022, an improvement of 23%. CURLF stock is up 44.5% year-to-date, leaving behind its yearly low of $2.47 per share. Per Nasdaq, the average CURLF price target is $7.06 vs the present $5.96 per share.

HashKey Group is a Hong Kong-based Web3 infrastructure developer that reported a valuation of more than $1.2 billion in January, according to a Bloomberg report.
Ripple notes in a new partnership announcement that HashKey has launched blockchain-powered supply chain finance solutions across mainland China, registering 23 banks and 4,300 suppliers.
Now, the payments firm and HashKey DX aim to offer the same solutions in Japan.
Explains Ripple,
“As part of this partnership, SBI Group companies will become the first Japanese corporations to utilize this supply chain finance solution. Looking ahead, the three companies will explore further collaboration on various enterprise blockchain use cases that will leverage the robust capabilities of the XRPL.”
XRP is trading at $0.4975 at time of writing. The eighth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 4% in the past 24 hours.

While the fall has muddied the short-term picture for Bitcoin, the analysts remain bullish for the long term. Traders latch on to every bit of negative news when the price action turns bearish. Investor sentiment received a beating on the muted response to the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that debuted on April 30. Continued outflows from the United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs for the fifth consecutive day also did little to soothe nerves.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Every bull phase witnesses sharp corrections, which shake out the weak hands. The lower levels give an opportunity to the long-term investors to add to their portfolios. However, it is better to wait for the price to confirm a bottom before initiating large bets.Could Bitcoin and the altcoins start a sharp recovery, trapping the aggressive bears? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin’s consolidation resolved to the downside on May 1, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBuyers will attempt to push the price back above $59,600, but the bears are likely to have other plans. If the price turns down from $59,600, it will suggest that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That will enhance the prospects of a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($66,596).Ether price analysisEther broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,170) and the $3,056 support on April 30, signaling that the bears are in command. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe selling continued on May 1, and the bears tugged the price below the solid support at $2,852. If bears sustain the price below $2,852, the ETH/USDT pair could move downward to $2,700 and subsequently to $2,400.Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push the price back above the moving averages. If they do that, it will indicate that the fall below $2,850 may have been a fake breakdown. BNB price analysisThe long tail on BNB’s (BNB) April 30 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased at lower levels but they could not sustain the momentum. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears continued selling and yanked the price below the moving averages on May 1. The BNB/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $495. This is an essential support for the bulls to defend because a break below $495 could sink the pair to $460 and later to $400.Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off $495 and rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for some more time. The bulls will have to overcome the obstacle at $635 to start the next leg of the uptrend.Solana price analysisThe failure of the bulls to start a rebound off $126 in Solana (SOL) shows that the bears remain in control.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThere is a minor support at $116, but if this level cracks, the selling could accelerate, and the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to $100. The greater the fall, the longer it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.If bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price above the 20-day EMA ($144). That may trap the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The pair may then ascend toward the 50-day SMA ($166).XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) tried to start a relief rally from the psychological level of $0.50 on April 29, but the bulls could not maintain the higher levels.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewSustained selling by the bears pulled the price below $0.50, opening the doors for a retest of the solid support at $0.46. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $0.46 and $0.41 because a break below it may start a downtrend.Alternatively, if the price bounces off $0.46 and rises above the 50-day SMA ($0.57), it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The XRP/USDT pair may then extend its stay inside the $0.41 to $0.74 range for several more days.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin’s (DOGE) fall picked up momentum after the price broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears have pulled the price below the neckline of the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. If the price remains below $0.12, the selling could intensify, and the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to $0.10 and eventually to $0.08.On the contrary, if the price quickly rises back above the neckline, it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will gain strength on a break above the 20-day EMA ($0.15), and a potential trend change will be signaled above the downtrend line.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) broke below the 50-day SMA ($5.32) on April 30, indicating that the bears are maintaining their pressure.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls are likely to defend the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.90 and the 61.8% retracement level of $4.25. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.58) to signal that the correction may be over.

Blockchain development firm Movement Labs has received an undisclosed investment from Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This investment comes on the heels of Movement Labs' $38 million Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.
Movement Labs is on a mission to build an ecosystem of blockchains based on the modular programming language Move, starting with “M2”, a Move Virtual Machine Layer 2 for Ethereum. The company plans to use the funds to expand into the Asia-Pacific region and encourage adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems.


“Binance Labs' support and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to implement our 'Move Anywhere' strategy, focusing on the vibrant and innovative APAC market,” said Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs.

Movement's Layer 2 blockchain aims to expand the use of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed by a team within Meta, formerly known as Facebook's now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.





Additionally, Movement Labs is developing Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The company will launch its public testnet Parthenon in the coming weeks and aims for a mainnet launch by the end of the year.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Features like DApp browsing, trading, NFT marketplaces, and even inscriptions tools are becoming increasingly in-demand.In an interview with Benzinga, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, revealed substantial shifts in user expectations for Web3 wallets over the past two years, reflecting broader trends within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Kan noted that the functionality of these wallets has expanded significantly, transforming from mere storage solutions to comprehensive platforms supporting various Web3 activities.“Previously, Web3 wallets were mainly seen as secure storage for assets. Now, they have evolved into complex gateways offering trading, DApp browsing, and more,” Kan explained. He further emphasized that Bitget Wallet has been at the forefront of this evolution since 2018, continuously enhancing its features to meet the growing demand for integrated services like NFT marketplaces and staking gateways.Kan also highlighted the rise of inscriptions and meme coins as prominent trends driving recent developments in the wallet space. “Inscriptions have gained traction, especially post-BTC halving and with the proliferation of ETFs. We’ve responded by enhancing BTC network support and even launched our own meme coin, MOEW, which has seen surprising interest from our users,” he said.Also Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bled Another $162 Million On TuesdayAddressing future expectations, Kan predicted that AI and intent-based management would play significant roles in the evolution of wallet technology. “Moving forward, integrating AI to improve the wallet experience isn't just about adding features—it's about fundamentally enhancing how users interact with Web3 technologies,” he stated.Kan also discussed the importance of security, a top concern for many users, especially following several high-profile breaches. “Security isn't just an add-on; it’s integral to the user experience. At Bitget, we’ve introduced keyless MPC wallets and have established strong partnerships for security audits, ensuring our users’ assets are protected without complicating the user experience,” he asserted.Bitget’s approach to integrating with various blockchain mainnets illustrates their strategic focus on interoperability and user engagement. “Our recent BWB Points campaign, for instance, allowed users to engage with over 40 different projects, earning points that could be converted into our upcoming BWB token,” Kan said, underlining the potential for such strategies to foster a more interconnected and user-friendly Web3 environment.As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will further explore these developments. Insights from leaders like Kan will be central to discussions on how the industry can navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the next generation of digital asset technologies.Read Next: Patrick McHenry Questions SEC’s Transparency On Ethereum As A SecurityImage: Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:15:52 </pubDate></item><item><title>Why Vitalik Buterin Prefers Multi-Signature Wallets</title><link>https://beincrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-multi-signature-hardware-wallets/</link><description>
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the security advantages of multi-signature wallets over hardware wallets.
Buterin highlighted crucial considerations for crypto holders worldwide to keep their assets secure.
Multi-Signature Wallets Over Hardware Wallets
Buterin stressed the significance of employing multi-signature wallets to safeguard personal funds. He revealed that he utilizes this method for over 90% of his assets. 
With multi-signature wallets, the control over funds is distributed among multiple parties, known as “keys.” Therefore, Buterin advocates for an M-of-N approach. This entails the user holding some keys while the remainder is entrusted to other individuals, forming a decentralized security network. 
Buterin also advised against disclosing the identities of these trusted parties to each other to ensure an added layer of privacy and security.

Addressing the potential pitfalls of hardware wallets, Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, highlighted the inherent risks posed by human error. Watts cautioned against scenarios where users inadvertently compromise their security, such as misplacing seed phrases or hastily relocating without access to essential wallet components. 

“When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself,” Watts said.


This reflects the importance of user vigilance and responsible storage practices, as even the most secure hardware wallets are susceptible to user-related vulnerabilities.
Buterin and Watts’ endorsement of multi-signature wallets aligns with the broader industry consensus on enhancing security protocols. Indeed, prioritizing robust security measures is fundamental to risk mitigation and asset protection.

April 2024 witnessed a remarkable 141% reduction in financial damages due to crypto-related security exploits, with losses totaling a historic low of $25.7 million. 
This figure represents the smallest amount recorded since 2021, suggesting a significant improvement in Crypto security measures.
Crypto Security Exploits Drop, Indicating Enhanced Its Safety
Crypto security firm CertiK highlighted that the sharp decrease in damages was primarily due to fewer exploits targeting blockchain protocols. The bulk of the April losses, amounting to $21 million, arose from DeFi platform attacks.
The repeated breach of FixedFloat’s Ethereum-based hot wallet resulted in a $2.8 million loss. The same group was responsible for a February attack, which cost the exchange $26 million, perpetrated this incident.

“Combining all the incidents in April, we’ve confirmed ~$ $25.7 m lost to exploits, hacks, and scams. This is the lowest figure we’ve recorded, dating back to 2021, and it is a 141% decrease from March,” CertiK said. 

Additionally, exit scams accounted for $4.3 million in losses. These frauds, where founders absconded with invested funds, included notable incidents like the suspected rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino. This is under investigation for potentially diverting $32 million in Ethereum.

Only three major incidents in April exceeded the $1 million threshold, reflecting a strengthening in protocol security. Among these, the tokenization platform Grandbase suffered a $2 million theft due to a compromised private key, which led to unauthorized token minting and subsequent robbery.
CertiK’s analysis points to an encouraging trend of resilience within the cryptocurrency industry despite ongoing challenges. The reduction in private key compromises and the lower frequency of high-value breaches suggest that enhanced security practices are becoming more effective.

Experts from CertiK and data from DefiLlama indicate that the DeFi sector, which has been the most affected since 2016 with losses totaling $5.8 billion, is now seeing a reversal in this trend.

Crypto protocols witnessed $25.7 million in losses across three major incidents in April, reaching a record low since 2021. Blockchain security firm CertiK highlights that this is a 141% decrease from March’s figures.The reduction in losses is due to the fall in private key compromise incidents, which plummeted from eleven in March to just three in April, CertiK underscored.The largest exploit in April involved FixedFloat, with suspicious withdrawals totaling approximately $3 million across multiple chains. FixedFloat acknowledged this as their second exploit by the same attackers since February.Meanwhile, exit scams also saw a downturn, with the most notable being CondomSol’s pre-sale scam on the Solana network, leading to losses of around $933,000. In total, April experienced 13 exit scams, a 40% reduction from the previous month.Flash loan attacks in April resulted in the lowest monthly losses since February 2022, with four incidents totaling $129,086. The largest of these accounted for $55,000. Combining all incidents, April’s losses amounted to approximately $25.7 million, the lowest on record since 2021.However, the brief CertiK report on April losses does not account for the ZKasino controversy. ZKasino’s co-founders allegedly performed an exit scam on April 25, by swapping nearly $33 million worth of Ether (ETH) for their native token ZKAS. The funds were locked on the gambling platform bridge, as users tried to be eligible for ZKAS airdrop.CertiK published that a more in-depth analysis will be provided as more information about this episode emerges.

She added that the DOJ's stance "contradicts existing Treasury guidance," and "violates the rule of law.""Arguments against self-custody software threaten the fundamental property rights that are core to being an American," Lummis said, adding that she will fight "for your rights to hold your own keys and run your own node." She further accused the Biden Administration of "criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance."Lummis' comments follow two recent cases where DOJ prosecutors have pushed for criminal charges against software developers for unlicensed money transmission: an unsealed indictment against Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet, and a reply brief responding to the defense's motion to dismiss in the case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.The DOJ's interpretation of money transmission laws, encompassing wallet developers who have no direct control over user assets, has sparked a backlash among the crypto community.Crypto advocacy group Coin Center has characterized the DOJ's stance as "a massive overreach," arguing that it contradicts existing FinCEN guidance and rulings.In a blog post, Coin Center's director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh claimed the DOJ's position would mean that "every functioning cryptocurrency wallet and smart contract is 'doing' money transmission and every developer is engaged in unlicensed money transmission."The group has filed an amicus brief in defense of Roman Storm, arguing that the publication of Tornado Cash's code is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:15:54 </pubDate></item><item><title>Bitcoin price could crash to $50K, predicts $800 billion bank</title><link>https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-could-crash-to-50k-predicts-800-billion-bank/</link><description>
As the cryptocurrency landscape undergoes a volatile shift, Standard Chartered, a global banking behemoth, has voiced concerns about  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price trajectory, suggesting it might drop to the $50,000 mark.
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has voiced concerns after Bitcoin’s recent dip below $60,000, indicating a potential drop toward $50,000-$52,000, according to reports.
Adding to the crypto market’s challenges are the significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and tepid interest in Hong Kong’s newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, the factors Kendrick cites as primary reasons for the recent downturn.


Key factors include five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and prices falling below the ETFs’ average purchase price. Furthermore, the average purchase price of these ETFs falling below $58,000 increases the risk of liquidation, especially since more than half of these ETF positions are incurring losses.
Additionally, the bank pointed out that the launch of the Hong Kong spot ETF did not meet expectations, with the focus on the low turnover volume of $11 million overshadowing the satisfactory net asset position of the new ETFs.
The broader economic environment hasn’t been supportive either, with tightening liquidity measures in the U.S. which have been worsening since mid-April, exerting additional pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.
Long-term optimism despite current volatility
Despite these immediate challenges, Standard Chartered remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The bank recently revised its end-of-2024 Bitcoin price prediction upward from $100,000 to $150,000.
The bank recommends purchasing Bitcoin if it falls to the $50,000-$52,000 range, or if the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th, which measures inflation, is favorable.
While the market currently faces downward pressure, the underlying momentum and institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin might rebound strongly. This belief is anchored in the crypto’s past performance and its foundational role in the digital asset space, pointing towards recovery as market conditions improve and as strategic investments in the ecosystem continue to unfold.

At the start of the year, it was trading for a little over $44,000. Capital flooded the market as investors with typically no exposure to cryptocurrencies were suddenly able to buy shares that track the price of the asset via brokerage accounts. Record amounts of money hit the products in the months following their launch, and in March, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $73,737.But the hype has cooled, and the Federal Reserve has meanwhile signaled it will keep interest rates higher for longer—scaring investors away from “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin.As a result, the funds have experienced significant outflows. Despite touching a new record in March, the price of Bitcoin today stands at $56,900, after dropping 13% in seven days. Since April, it has traded well below its 2021 record of $69,044.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:15:55 </pubDate></item><item><title>UK Government Publishes New Cryptocurrency Report - Here Are The Details - Bitcoin Sistemi</title><link>https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/uk-government-publishes-new-cryptocurrency-report-here-are-the-details/</link><description>
A new report published by the UK government's financial arm has revealed that cryptocurrency companies, along with retail banking, wholesale banking and asset management, are among the top money laundering risks between 2022 and 2023.
The report's conclusions were drawn from risk assessments carried out on 238 firms by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA, a financial regulator in the United Kingdom, has been trying to get crypto firms to register with it and comply with money laundering rules since 2020.



According to the report, the United Kingdom is making intense efforts to suppress cryptocurrency-related crimes. In October 2022, UK police announced that they were deploying crypto tactical advisors across the country to assist in the seizure of digital assets linked to criminal activity. The National Police Chiefs' Council reported that they managed to seize hundreds of millions worth of crypto from crimes.
Data from the newly published report showed that between 2022 and 2023 the FCA had 52 full-time financial crime specialist staff dedicated to anti-money laundering supervision. Of these, 15 were focused on regulating crypto businesses.

Jack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block is being probed by federal prosecutors after a former employee claimed that “everything in its compliance section was flawed” and that it’s “led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”
As reported by NBC, the whistleblower also claimed that Block and its business units Cash App and Square transacted crypto for terrorists, facilitated payments for sanctioned countries, and flouted compliance protocols.
The whistleblower — a former Block employee — reportedly provided 100 pages of documents to prosecutors from the Southern District of New York that show the alleged malpractice. 
The documents allegedly detail how Block processed numerous crypto transactions for terrorist-designated groups. Meanwhile, Square and Cash App allegedly failed to collect relevant information from customers that would help assess risks.
Square also reportedly facilitated thousands of transactions with countries under economic sanctions.

Despite being alerted to these alleged breaches, the whistleblower says the Block failed to change any company processes. They claim that a mix of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including bitcoin, credit card, and dollar transfers, were not reported to the government under law.  
They told NBC News, “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”
These allegations of an inadequate compliance program echo claims from a research report published last year by short-sellers Hindenburg Research. This report alleged that “Cash App suppressed internal concerns and ignored user pleas for help as criminal activity and fraud ran rampant on its platform.”
Block execs allegedly knew compliance pitfalls
The former employee’s lawyer, Edward Siedle, who previously represented the Securities and Exchange Commission, said, “It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”
A Block spokesperson told NBC News it voluntarily reported ‘thousands’ of the flagged transactions to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The former employee, however, says this isn’t true.

The spokesperson added, “Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment.
“Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a significant downturn, marking its second-longest streak of weekly red candles in its history. This development has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with investors expressing concern over the potential implications for the cryptocurrency‘s future.
Starting on April 1, Bitcoin began a five-week losing streak, opening at $71,300 and dropping to $57,300 by May 1. This situation is particularly noteworthy as it comes in the midst of a supposed bull market directly following the Bitcoin halving event.
Historically, Bitcoin has only experienced similar losing streaks in bear market cycles, making the current situation unique and raising questions about its implications.


Nevertheless, the trading week is not over, and a rally above $71,300 would revert this 5-week losing streak.
A share of bullish optimism
The Bitcoin Archive account on X highlighted the significance of this downturn in a post, comparing it to past events.

“Bitcoin is 23% off its all-time high. So why does it feel worse than it is? This is the second-longest run of RED weekly candles in Bitcoin history! Both times were deep into a bear market.”

Despite the current situation, the Bitcoin Archive offered some perspective. The analyst pointed out that after the last red candle streak, Bitcoin experienced a six-month run of green monthly candles, followed by another five months of gains.

This historical precedent suggests that while the current situation may be alarming, it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bear market.
Short-term bearish forecast amid a weekly red streak
Adding to the uncertainty, Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin could drop as low as $50,000. This forecast comes amid a broader context of market speculation and various predictions about Bitcoin’s future price movements.
However, it is essential to note that many factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, influence Bitcoin’s price.
In this context, potential Bitcoin miners’ capitulation surges as revenue drops to a six-month low of $30 million. Moreover, long-position traders were liquidated for $400 million in losses since April 30.
Given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Bitcoin will continue its downward trend or rebound to new highs. Investors and market observers will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds in the coming weeks and months.
In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent performance has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with concerns over a potential bear market emerging. Yet, historical precedents and the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market suggest that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about Bitcoin’s future trajectory.
As always, investors and market participants should exercise caution and stay informed about the latest developments in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

This background positions him strategically to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges.Teng’s leadership has been marked by a clear focus on compliance. He has publicly acknowledged the need for significant changes within Binance, stating that the exchange’s previous approach to regulation was “inadequate.” This shift is evident in several key initiatives, including:
Establishing a Global Headquarters: Previously operating with a decentralized structure, Binance is now actively seeking a physical headquarters, a move that signals a willingness to cooperate with regulatory bodies.



Re-entering Regulated Markets: Binance has made efforts to re-enter markets like India and Thailand, demonstrating a commitment to adhering to local regulations.



Increased Transparency: Teng has emphasized the importance of transparency and user protection, initiatives that could potentially rebuild trust with regulators and users alike.
Before joining Binance, Teng was recognized for his innovative regulatory approaches at Abu Dhabi Global Market and had pivotal roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange​​. His expertise is seen as pivotal in navigating Binance through its complex regulatory challenges, especially after the company agreed to a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over accusations of violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws​.Under Teng’s leadership, Binance is not just focusing on rectifying past issues but is also pushing forward with new initiatives. Also Read: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Sees Crypto Industry Entering ‘New Phase’The company has ramped up its compliance measures, strategically hiring key talents from regulatory bodies and major financial institutions. This focus on compliance is part of Teng’s broader strategy to foster trust and ensure Binance’s growth in the highly scrutinized cryptocurrency market​​.Moreover, Teng is setting his sights on broadening Binance's operations, with significant expansions in the Middle East and Europe. The United Arab Emirates and France have been chosen as regional headquarters, reflecting Teng’s familiarity with the MENA region and the strategic importance of the European market under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation​.Challenges And Uncertainties RemainDespite these efforts, Binance still faces significant challenges. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.US, Zhao, and Teng himself, alleging unregistered exchange operations and commingling of user funds, looms large. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny in various regions continues to cast a shadow over the exchange’s global operations.The Road Ahead: A New Era For Binance?While Zhao’s return after his sentence is expected, the long-term impact of his imprisonment and the changing regulatory landscape remain to be seen. Richard Teng’s leadership presents an opportunity for Binance to embrace a more compliant and transparent approach, potentially paving the way for a new era of stability and growth.However, navigating the intricate web of global regulations and regaining the trust of both regulators and users will be a monumental task. The success of Teng’s leadership will hinge on his ability to effectively address these challenges and steer Binance towards a more sustainable future.Looking Towards The Future Of Digital AssetsEvents like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 will be crucial platforms for industry leaders and experts to dissect the evolving regulatory landscape and its impact on major players like Binance.

The company provided the following statement to NBC News:“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:15:57 </pubDate></item><item><title>Billionaire Whale Deposits Over $147,980,000 in Crypto to Kraken As Bitcoin (BTC) Kicks Off May With More Red - The Daily Hodl</title><link>https://dailyhodl.com/2024/05/01/billionaire-whale-deposits-over-147980000-in-crypto-to-kraken-as-bitcoin-btc-kicks-off-may-with-more-red/</link><description>
								Bitcoin has started the month of May with another downward move, so far touching the $56,480 level after an already red April.
The breakdown coincides with several whales – known and unknown – sending massive amounts of coins to crypto exchanges, presumably to sell on the open market.










Initially spotted by blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, one whale was seen depositing 1,225 BTC worth $70.26 million to crypto exchange Kraken early on Wednesday. Several days before, the same whale was spotted depositing a separate 1,225 coins, also to Kraken.
According to Lookonchain, the whale had accumulated over 24,755 BTC worth about $1.68 billion between March 1 and April 15th – before de-risking and sending their coins back to Kraken as prices dropped.
Earlier this week, crypto “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reported that digital assets manager Grayscale sent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to Coinbase, potentially to sell on the open market.
Arkham’s data shows Grayscale sending BTC to Coinbase Prime or addresses associated with Coinbase mostly in batches of $42.84 million.
With Bitcoin’s price correction testing the conviction of bulls, some analysts like Benjamin Cowen have suggested that the asset class may be in for at least a multi-month bear market, similar to 2019.
Other analysts are more confident that the downward move is more of a short-term dip in a more urgent bull run.
Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who share the Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, say that with BTC’s latest correction, “the asymmetric bet is to the upside.”
According to the analysts, BTC could be ready to find a bottom just as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) make their statement on interest rates.
“Volatility and Fear in Crypto – but is a Bottom close?
BTC and Altcoins saw a strong sell-off yesterday. And more this morning.
Fear has been spreading and calls for new lows are everywhere.
But – are we in fact close to the bottom? A large Pennant may still be the Correctional Structure. And FOMC is tonight…
Extension level is almost reached. Could 56.5K-ish be the turning point into FOMC?”

Ripple has just made a major move into the Japanese market through a partnership with HashKey DX.



This expansion has occurred amidst ongoing regulatory challenges in the US.



XRP has experienced an initial surge, but a pullback caused by Bitcoin has raised questions about its future trajectory.
Ripple, a leading blockchain solutions provider, has partnered with HashKey DX, a Tokyo-based blockchain consulting firm. This collaboration marks Ripple’s expansion into the Japanese market, aiming to revolutionize supply chain finance for Japanese enterprises through the use of XRP Ledger technology.Ripple’s XRP Takes Aim at Japanese MarketThe partnership leverages the efficiency and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain platform known for its rapid settlement speeds. This technology will be utilized to address the complexities of enterprise-level financial operations in Japan, particularly within supply chain finance.This move builds upon HashKey Group’s success in China, where their blockchain solutions have significantly boosted trade and financing operations. Together with SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple, the partnership will introduce innovative solutions specifically designed for the Japanese market.Ripple’s expansion into Japan is crucial, as the company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Despite these challenges, the announcement has generated positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s native token, XRP, experienced an initial price surge, reflecting optimism surrounding its Japanese expansion efforts.XRP Price Pulls Back After Recent GainsHowever, XRP’s price has since experienced a pullback, trading around $0.493. This volatility is further underscored by XRP’s declining price over recent months, falling approximately 21% year-to-date.Several hurdles lie ahead for XRP, including trading below key exponential moving averages and a scheduled 1 billion token unlock on May 1, valued at roughly $493.4 million. This monthly sell-off could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price in the coming weeks.The market’s Relative Strength Index hovers near the 35 mark, indicating a balanced state between buyers and sellers. However, as it nears oversold territory, the future trajectory of XRP remains uncertain, especially with Bitcoin’s recent drop adding more pressure. Investors are now waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next significant price movement.On the Flipside
If Bitcoin doesn’t recover from its drop below $60,000, it could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price.



The Relative Strength Index sits near 35, suggesting a balanced market with no clear buying or selling pressure.
Why This MattersThis partnership marks a significant step for Ripple’s international expansion, particularly considering the established success of HashKey’s blockchain solutions in China. By focusing on revolutionizing supply chain finance within the Japanese market, Ripple positions itself to potentially disrupt a crucial sector and gain a strong foothold in a historically receptive crypto market.

The Fed decided to leave the interest rate steady. The expectation was that interest rates would be kept constant.
Here is Bitcoin's first reaction after the decision:



Now all eyes are on FED President Jerome Powell. Powell is expected to make a speech at 21:30 GMT after the FED's third meeting of the year. You can follow all the details of this speech live on Bitcoinsistemi.com.






At the close of the two-day meeting that started on Tuesday, the FED was expected to keep the short-term interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. FED officials are not planned to update their March forecasts for the economy, inflation and interest rates. But Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may offer clues about where he thinks interest rates are headed.
Interest rates have been trending sideways for months. Forecasters predicted that the first interest rate cut would be made in June and that there would be a total of three interest rate cuts by 2024. Now they are predicting only one discount in September.


Economic forecasters will be scrutinizing Jerome Powell's words very carefully when he talks about where interest rates might go.
Economists at Goldman Sachs and Barclays expect Powell to reiterate his earlier comment today that “it will likely take longer than expected to achieve the greater confidence” needed to cut interest rates.





Barclays economist March Giannoni doesn't expect Powell “to be very specific about the number of reductions.”

Nigerian authorities are pursuing Binance executives for currency devaluation.
Contrasting legal outcomes raised questions about fairness in treatment.

Just as Binance’s [BNB] founder made headlines for a 4-month prison sentence on money laundering charges, Nigeria intensified its pursuit of two Binance officers from Africa. 
On February 2024, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional head for Africa, and his colleague, Binance’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer Tigran Gambaryan, faced accusations for allegedly facilitating the devaluation of the Naira (Nigeria’s official currency). 
The reason behind Binance head’s escape 
Despite being invited for discussions to resolve tensions, their visit took an unexpected turn. Detained by security agencies, they were pushed into a legal mess, prompting Anjarwalla’s daring escape. 
This incident ignited a global pursuit, escalating concerns about the intersection of cryptocurrency and international law enforcement. 
Remarking on the same, Mr. Gabra Omar, Vice President of the Interpol Africa Executive Committee on Extradition in a recent conversation with Sunrise Daily noted, 
“As soon as this individual escaped, there was a massive manhunt for this individual.”
He added, 
“We have done that to make sure that he doesn’t escape justice…one day he will be brought to justice. It’s just a matter of time.”
The dichotomy of punishments 
However, in an unexpected twist, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a four-month prison sentence, contrary to the Department of Justice’s expectation of at least three years. 
In contrast, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder, faced a severe downfall, resulting in a 25-year prison term for fraud. 
This juxtaposition highlighted potential disparities in the legal treatment of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world. 
Interpol’s VP confident in extradition efforts
Nigeria’s proactive stance against money laundering and terrorism financing in the crypto sphere isn’t a recent development.
 The recent freeze of more than 1,100 accounts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) underlines this commitment. 
Furthermore, the potential extension of the crypto crackdown to platforms such as Bybit, KuCoin, and OKX underscores Nigeria’s ongoing efforts in this regard. 
Ergo, Omar is confident in the extradition of Binance’s Anjarwalla, claiming, 
“You hide, we smoke you out!”

To address the concerns, the project, led by the sesquipedalian computer engineer Sreeram Kannan, came up with a new plan for something called "intersubjective forking." The purpose of this mechanism would be to take care of "instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved." If such an "intersubjective fault" were to occur, the EIGEN token could be forked without having to fork the main Ethereum blockchain. Are you with me so far? Well, there's a catch, according to a blog post: Very little of this will be functional when the EIGEN token launches: "With its design being completely novel, the concept needs to be absorbed and discussed widely by the ecosystem participants. The initial implementation of intersubjective staking at this launch mirrors the full protocol to only a limited extent. However, there are still several parameters that need to be determined for full actuation." Such a not-really-fully-functional system would echo EigenLayer's mainnet launch a few weeks ago, where, as detailed by Coindesk, crucial promised features, including the paramount "slashing" and "attributable security" mechanisms, were held back from the launch, because they weren't ready. It goes without saying that a lot of these details were lost on crypto traders who had poured some $15 billion of deposits into the project, many of them merely hoping to qualify for the EIGEN token airdrop that roughly zero people in crypto doubted would eventually come. The parsimoniousness of the terms, however, apparently left many of these so-called airdrop farmers wanting. "Not all feedback was glowing," as the Bankless newsletter put it, and complaints centered partly on the token's initial period of "non-transferability." Only 15% of the tokens will go to the "stakedrop" – the Eigen Foundation's term – and more than half of the tokens will be allocated to investors and early contributors, with unlocks starting after just one year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:01 </pubDate></item><item><title>Trustnodes - Bringing You Tomorrow Today</title><link>https://www.trustnodes.com/2024/05/01/bitcoin-etf-selling-greens-eths-ratio</link><description>

Blockchain gaming is seen as a hot narrative in crypto for 2024 by different industry players, such as Binance and CoinGecko. According to the latter, the total market cap of blockchain gaming tokens is over $18.6 billion.Delabs Games is one of the players building in this sector, focusing on an ecosystem built on the concept of assets that can be used in different games, called Asset Inventory System.Joonmo Kwon, founder and CEO at Delabs Games, shared with Crypto Briefing his thoughts on how blockchain technology could revolutionize the gaming industry, how gamers perceive this two-sector junction, and why current traditional titles are not tapping into Web3.Crypto Briefing – When it comes to the traditional gaming sector, what are some stark differences you can point out compared to blockchain?Joonmo Kwon – One significant difference between Delabs Games and traditional gaming lies in their approach to accessibility and user experience. Delabs Games prioritizes creating fun games for everyone, including Web2 users who may not be familiar with NFTs, wallets, or crypto. Their simple onboarding process allows players to enjoy the benefits of Web3 gaming without needing extensive knowledge of blockchain technology.In contrast, traditional gaming often lacks the concept of ownership and tangible value for players. While players may invest significant time and money into traditional games, they typically do not retain any tangible assets once the game is no longer supported. Web3 gaming, on the other hand, enables players to own digital assets that are valuable and tradable, providing a sense of ownership and lasting value.Moreover, the psychological impact of ownership plays a crucial role in Web3 gaming. By owning in-game assets, players become more invested in the game, leading to increased engagement, loyalty, and community participation. This stands in contrast to traditional gaming, where players may feel less connected to the games they play due to the lack of ownership.Overall, Delabs Games and Web3 gaming represent a shift towards a more sustainable and aligned relationship between game companies and players. By offering more value to players through ownership and participation, Web3 gaming disrupts the traditional gaming industry and creates a model where the interests of both the company and the player are better aligned.Crypto Briefing – For a gamer not familiar with the concept of digital assets, can you explain how the Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts their gaming experience?A pivotal focus of AIS is its capacity to transition players from solitary game participants to platform users by immersing them in diverse gaming experiences. This is made possible by enabling assets acquired in one game to enhance performance in others. Termed ‘Player Liquidity,’ the objective is to facilitate seamless transitions between games, cultivating a vibrant platform environment.The Asset Inventory System (AIS) lies at the core of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, offering a gamified platform crafted to facilitate the flow of player liquidity across multiple games on the platform.AIS motivates users to explore different games through a blend of external rewards and internal satisfaction. Users are driven to gather “assets,” which can be equipped in inventory slots to enrich both their gaming journey and earnings on the platform. This inventive feature adds to the layer’s appeal, encouraging smooth transitions between games and the platform.The Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts the gaming experience in several ways. The first is enhanced Interoperability and partnership opportunities, as AIS facilitates interoperability between the Delabs Games ecosystem and third-party projects. By suggesting new boosts and set bonuses for assets from third-party projects, the Delabs Games Playable Layer seamlessly introduces new content to platform users. This not only enriches the gaming experience but also opens up opportunities for users to fully explore third-party offerings, ultimately increasing conversion and retention rates.The second is equipping assets for boost effects, as players can equip assets to their inventory for boost effects both in-game and on the platform. For example, assets like speed boosts in Rumble Racing Star or staking APY boosts can significantly enhance gameplay or earnings. Each asset can possess rarity, boost, and set bonuses, further diversifying the strategies players can employ to optimize their gaming experience.A third positive impact is collecting assets, since players have various avenues to acquire assets, whether through gameplay, contributions to the platform, or ownership of digital assets within the ecosystem. These earned assets can be equipped in the inventory slots of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, providing players with a range of boost effects that enhance their in-game performance or earnings.This incentivizes player engagement and participation, enriching the overall gaming experience while fostering a sense of ownership and progression within the ecosystem.Crypto Briefing – The gaming industry already has traditional titles that rely heavily upon users’ interactions and could be favored by the AIS concept, such as Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia. Why do you think none of the companies behind these titles started experimenting with that?AIS’s core element lies in providing a gamified platform experience. While games like Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia focus primarily on in-game experiences, the Delabs Games Playable Layer extends the gaming experience beyond just gameplay, integrating a platform-native gamified experience. This system allows users to collect and combine various assets for benefits both within individual games and across the platform.The Delabs Games Playable Layer promotes platform composability, enabling systematic integration across games on the platform. Additionally, by starting with a curated selection of high-quality games and gradually expanding with mini-games, Delabs Games strikes a balance between game quality and accessibility, catering to various intrinsic motivations of gamers.In contrast, traditional titles may not have experimented with similar concepts because they focus primarily on in-game experiences and may not prioritize the broader platform experience that Delabs Games aims to provide. Delabs Games emphasizes community participation, incentivizing engagement and growth through reward mechanisms and a collaborative mindset rooted in the essence of Web3.Crypto Briefing – Blockchain gaming is commonly overlooked by traditional gamers since it involves monetary aspects and NFTs, which are not so popular in this group. From a builder’s perspective, do you see more penetration from blockchain gaming among traditional gamers?Yes, there’s a noticeable shift in the perception and adoption of blockchain gaming among traditional gamers. The quality of Web3 games is steadily improving, accompanied by a diversification of genres beyond the casual and puzzle games that previously dominated the space. With expansions into genres like FPS, MMO, and RPGs, blockchain gaming is becoming more appealing to traditional gamers who seek diverse and immersive gaming experiences.Moreover, major players in the gaming industry, including Nexon and Ubisoft, have announced their entry into Web3 game development, indicating a growing acceptance and interest in blockchain gaming among established gaming companies. Additionally, industry heavyweights like CCP Games, Ubisoft, Square Enix, Sony, and Konami are cautiously exploring the Web3 gaming landscape, further validating the potential of blockchain technology in gaming.This trend is not limited to established companies; newer entrants like Delabs Games are also venturing into the market, bringing fresh talent and innovation to the forefront. With this influx of talent and investment, blockchain gaming is poised to continue its penetration into the traditional gaming market, offering new games and narratives that appeal to a broader audience.

Their research suggests the average entry price for U.S. Bitcoin ETF holders sits around $57,300, potentially even higher, a level Bitcoin prices are rapidly approaching.Despite the predicted correction, 10x Research maintains a positive long-term outlook. Bitcoin’s recent one-year high validates their early 2023 prediction of a new bull market, further reinforced by its proximity to their forecasted halving price of $63,160. Additionally, their 2023 year-end target of $45,000 was nearly achieved, and their post-ETF approval target of $57,000, later revised to $70,000, underscores their continuous analysis and adaptation.Their ability to accurately predict market movements stems from a deep understanding of historical trends and the driving forces within the crypto industry. As 10x Research points out in their previous reports, analyzing these factors has been instrumental in their successful predictions throughout the current bull market.Also Read: Don’t Get Left Behind: Web3 Wallets Offer More Than You Think In Today’s MarketWhy It Matters: Looking back, the August 2023 correction was attributed to rising 10-year Treasury bond yields and a hawkish Fed stance, mirroring the situation during the August 2015 RMB devaluation. While the initial impact was a sharp decline, Bitcoin ultimately recovered significantly by year-end.Similar foresight was applied in January 2024, where 10x Research anticipated a correction to $36,000/$38,000, citing the historical tendency for corrections following major Bitcoin product approvals. They recommended hedging long exposure but turned bullish again as Bitcoin rebounded, reiterating their $70,000 target.March 2024 saw another crucial turning point. Recognizing the potential for a +/-10% move, 10x Research established a line in the sand at $68,300, indicating a potential significant top if breached. This aligns with their current prediction of a correction towards $52,000/$55,000 within the ongoing bull market.Several factors contribute to this anticipated correction. The research highlights a shift in ETF buying behavior, with six consecutive days of outflows observed. What’s Next: As the average entry price of $57,300 is approached, further ETF unwinding is expected, potentially pushing prices down. Additionally, the estimated all-in mining cost of $53,000/$55,000 for Bitcoin miners could trigger selling to protect operations.While a 25% to 29% correction is anticipated, 10x Research acknowledges the possibility of a consolidation period instead of a sharp snapback rally.As industry leaders gather at events like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19th, insights from 10x Research and other experts will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of the current bull market and preparing for potential corrections within the broader landscape.Read Next: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Sees Crypto Industry Entering ‘New Phase’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:01 </pubDate></item><item><title>SAMOURAI SAGA: FOUNDER’S BAIL - YouTube</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn6WCrc6s-Q</link><description>AboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy &amp; SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:02 </pubDate></item><item><title>Here’s Why Changpeng Zhao Got a Lighter Prison Sentence - DailyCoin</title><link>https://dailycoin.com/heres-why-changpeng-zhao-got-a-lighter-prison-sentence/?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss</link><description>
        Erratum: The following article was published with a factual error, and was corrected on 2024/05/02 at 08:05 UTCIn the article, it was stated that Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was convicted of facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals.The statement should have read that his conviction pertained solely to the violations of U.S. anti-money laundering laws.The article has been amended and updated.
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to prison.



The significantly reduced sentence CZ received has raised questions across the industry. 



Analysts have described the recent ruling as unjust. 
Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the U.S. Department of Justice have been embroiled in a legal tussle over the past months following his November conviction of violating anti-money laundering laws. As one of the biggest legal cases to rock the crypto industry, CZ’s conviction resulted in significant sanctions, including a hefty $4.3 billion and his resignation from Binance as CEO. Despite the weight of the penalties, Zhao was not let off the hook, and was promised an additional hefty jail time. Following several months of anticipation of his sentencing, US Judge Richard Jones finally brought the legal case to a close, albeit with a surprising twist.CZ’s Shocking Sentence Contrasting the promised hefty sentence, Judge Jones handed CZ a mere four-month prison term for his guilty plea to violating US anti-money laundering laws.
Justifying the ruling, Judge Jones asserted that the sentence, which mocks the 3-year term recommended by prosecutors and falls below the maximum one to two years under federal laws, is appropriate for the former CEO, citing the lack of evidence that he was “informed” of the illegal activities at the exchange.Zhao’s conduct and reputation were also focal points in his sentencing. Despite the prosecutor’s argument that he adopted an intentional ‘apology over permission’ approach to circumventing regulations, Judge Jones emphasized that he acted responsibly and displayed a modest nature.“The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility,” stated the judge, adding that “There needs to be an effort by this court to impose a sentence that’s appropriate and reasonable” 
The perceived attributes, built on Zhao’s apology and over 160 letters from his family seeking leniency, are believed to have influenced Judge Jones’s ruling, resulting in the ousted CEO receiving minimal time for his conviction.CZ’s reduced jail time has spotlighted its stark contrast from another major legal crypto case in the United States.How CZ’s Sentence Differs From SBF’sThe Justice Department’s conviction of Channgpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) in November 2023 marked an eventful history, considering both positions as once-hailed titans of the industry.However, while CZ’s sentence was a mere four months in jail, SBF bagged a 25-year term on March 28, 2024, raising a debate over the stark difference.The severity of their charges justifies the variance in their sentencing. Unlike Zhao, whose allegations were solely focused on regulatory violations, SBF was convicted on several counts of financial fraud, including wire and securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  Additionally, SBF was declared guilty of misappropriating user funds and triggering losses of over $8 billion for the users and the broader industry, a crime not present in the CZ cases. Binance has repeatedly reiterated the safety of users’ funds, providing the exchange and CEO an edge in its regulatory case.On the Flipside
Changpeng Zhao’s wealth and influence have been spotlighted as another reason for his reduced term.



One of the allegations against Binance was the facilitation of illicit transactions for terrorist organizations, and analysts have decried his light sentence as a miscarriage of justice.



Despite the conclusion of his legal battles, the former CEO will not return to Binance, as his November ousting was final.
Why This MattersA mere 120-day sentence for Changpeng Zhao constitutes a win for him by letting him off the hook easily, considering the severity of the charges for which he was convicted and the rather stringent approach the DOJ is renowned for. CZ has issued a post-sentence statement; read this article to find out what he shared:CZ Vows to Focus on ‘Next Chapter’ After Sentencing Regulations are still tightening in the United States; read more about the DOJ’s latest target:Samourai Wallet Founder Pleads Innocence to DOJ’s Charges

Bankman-Fried could be in his fifties by the time he leaves prison and will likely have fewer assets than Zhao, who will be out of prison by the end of the year and, according to Forbes, has an estimated net worth of $33 billion.But let’s back up a minute. Bankman-Fried was arrested in 2022, extradited to the United States, pleaded not guilty, given house arrest, remanded to jail after allegations of witness intimidation, prosecuted in a six-week trial, found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Zhao was charged in 2023, pleaded guilty, was allowed to remain free on bail, was sentenced to four months in prison and will surrender himself in a matter of days.The former FTX CEO faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misuse of customer funds. CZ faced one charge related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.“CZ was charged with a crime that is more akin to a regulatory violation: the failure to have an adequate system of Anti-Money Laundering controls, while SBF was charged with wire fraud in connection with the secret plundering of billions of dollars in crypto custodied with FTX to prop up Alameda,” Mark Bini, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While both [crimes] are serious, SBF’s crime was far more serious.”Source: Tiffany FongFrom the beginning of his legal woes, Bankman-Fried and his defense team have largely maintained that he “did what [he] thought was right.” In the sentencing hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan accused the former FTX CEO of lying on the stand and described his testimony as “evasive.” His first interview after the judge laid down a 25-year judgment included SBF saying: “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal.”The facts of the case presented at trial also undermined SBF’s defense. Many government witnesses, including his former girlfriend and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, suggested that he orchestrated the misuse of FTX user funds.In contrast, Zhao did not publicly comment on the case between U.S. authorities and Binance since a $4.3 billion settlement and his guilty plea in November 2023. He submitted hundreds of pages worth of letters from industry leaders, family members and others. Judge Richard Jones commented on the outpouring of support for CZ at his sentencing hearing, adding he had “risked [his] entire net worth” for Binance.“Even though I believe he was guilty of much more, the DOJ didn’t have the evidence, and that’s why they could only get CZ to admit to rather light crimes,” Swan Bitcoin managing Director Terrence Yang told Cointelegraph. “Unlike SBF, [...] CZ didn’t fight extradition (was in a non-extradition country) and agreed to only light crimes in his plea deal. CZ is only paying $50 million in his plea deal with the DOJ.”Source: Peter HannRelated: Changpeng Zhao’s 4-month sentence a ‘general deterrence,’ says lawyerDespite speculation from many crypto users, it is doubtful that CZ and SBF will share a cell while incarcerated, let alone be housed in the same facility. Though the judge in SBF’s case suggested that he would serve in a San Francisco Bay Area prison, he may also allow the former FTX CEO to stay in New York during his appeal. Zhao will serve four months at the Camp at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington, with a reporting date to be determined.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of FlameUpdate (May 1 at 8:45 pm UTC): This article has been updated to clarify where Changpeng Zhao will be serving his sentence.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin has pulled back 22% from its all-time high in March. Now, on-chain intelligence company Glassnode suggests the market could be “hammering out a local bottom formation.” In a new report, the firm suggests that the market is currently still in a “euphoria” phase—a period in a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin. When investors are in this state, the market should expect a correction.With Bitcoin crashing to $57,000 at the time of writing, many investors believe we’re currently experiencing such a correction. But how much further will this drawback go?Glassnode said that a good way to identify whether we've reached the local bottom is when short-term investors realize losses. Its historical data shows numerous examples from 2020 until now that show when one-week to one-month-old entities realize losses, Bitcoin’s price often begins to climb shortly after.Carlos Mercado, data scientist at analytics company Flipside Crypto, told Decrypt, “I'm inclined to believe Glassnode is correctly identifying the ‘paper hands’ phenomenon within a specific cohort.”“Paper hand” investors leave the market at the highest rate when the market is reaching its bottom. As long as the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio—a measure of an asset's market cap versus the value stored in the asset—remains between 1.0 and 0.9, it has a chance to bounce back.Fortunately, the market is within this band, providing hope that it can rebound.“It could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation,” the report explained. “That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.”Since the publication of this report, the price of BTC has continued to slide from $66,700 down to $57,000. Is this the beginning of the paper-hands sell-off that the report predicts? Or will it go lower?“Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday, the closest consolidation to the current price level was in the $50,000 to $52,000 area,” senior market analyst at FxPro Alex Kuptsikevich explained to Decrypt.“A more dramatic scenario suggests a pullback to the $40,000 to $44,000 area, which would shake the weak hands out of the market before we get sustained interest from new buyers,” Kuptsikevich added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:06 </pubDate></item><item><title>Bitcoin Price Recovers After Fed Announces No Rate Hike At FOMC</title><link>https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-recovers-after-fed-announces-no-rate-hike-at-fomc/</link><description>
																The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate of 5.25%% to 5.5% at the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Wednesday, following a fearsome 6% drawdown in Bitcoin’s price earlier that day.
Within five minutes of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price rose from $57,300 to $57,700

Per a press release, the central bank said it also plans to slow down the rate at which it sells US Treasury securities starting in June, reducing its monthly redemption cap from $60 billion to $25 billion.
Market participants overwhelmingly expected the Fed to maintain its interest rate at 5.25% heading into the meeting, expecting cuts to potentially take off in Q4.
However, words from the central bank confirmed market fears that the central bank may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell nationwide price inflation, which remains stubbornly above 3%.
“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” the Fed wrote.
The economy also remains surprisingly resilient: data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that 81% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have filed their Q1 earnings have beaten their first-quarter expectations.
Bitcoin’s price is known to be influenced by central bank policy and macroeconomic liquidity conditions.
Some analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe BTC will continue to surge past $100,000 as central bank balance sheets continue to expand.

Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose.



This comes as crypto traders lose $400M following Bitcoin’s crash to $56K.



Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s long-term outperformance compared to traditional assets.




While crypto investors shoulder substantial losses over the past day amid the market retracement, renowned Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor took to X to reassure enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains the essential asset they cannot afford to overlook. In his words, “Bitcoin is for the money you can’t afford to lose.”







Saylor’s commentary comes amid Bitcoin’s price correction in the past few days, culminating in the asset revisiting the $56K range. At the press time value of $57,568, BTC is trading at one of its lowest points in the two months.



Following the asset’s substantial crash in the last few hours, at least 141K crypto traders who had placed bets on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory have been liquidated, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million. Nonetheless, Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, remains confident that this downturn should be less concerning for Bitcoin investors.









The short video accompanying Saylor’s tweet illustrated Bitcoin’s performance over the past eight years compared to various traditional investments, including the S&amp;P 500, Gold, U.S. real estate, U.S. dollar, Nigerian Naira, Turkish Lira, and Argentine Peso.



It depicted that while Bitcoin maintained an over 100% gain year-on-year since 2016, these other investments struggled to attain comparable returns.



For instance, in 2019, Gold and U.S. real estate saw significant gains of around 20%. However, these gains gradually diminished over the years to single-digit percentages. At the same time, currencies like the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso experienced crashes, plummeting to as low as 0.001%.



These outcomes have solidified Saylor’s belief that Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose. Responding to Saylor’s sentiment, X user AfriBull remarked, “Bitcoin has become the ultimate hedge against fiat volatility globally.”

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Federal Reserve Wednesday elected to keep its key interest rate steady as the central bank’s focus on fighting inflation compounded pain in the crypto market.In his typically cautious tone, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% was difficult but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”He would not reveal to reporters when there would be a rate cut.“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell added in a prepared statement.As of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 4.6% and 1.3% over the past day to $57,600 and $2,945, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen slightly throughout the trading day.But while the daily shift is broadly downward, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have marked slight increases over the past hour, including ahead of and since the rate announcement. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past hour, while Ethereum has perked up by 2% during the same span.Signs of stubborn inflation have lent traders pause, as fears boiled over last month that the Fed could be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Those jitters were elevated recently by a stronger-than-expected rise in inflation and growth in wages in the first quarter.Shifting rate expectations are driving Bitcoin’s price more as spot Bitcoin ETFs see pittering inflows, CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt Monday. For Ethereum, the pressure comes as a court battle over its regulatory status in the U.S. continues to come to light.Inflation has fallen steadily from multi-decade highs in 2022, but it remains above the Fed’s target of 2% annually. When inflation clocked in at 3.5% in the 12 months through March, a lack of change compared to the previous month’s release caused crypto markets to shudder immediately.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a target range of between 5.25% and 5.5% since July of last year, pushing forward for months with the highest rates in more than 23 years.Higher interest rates, which can slow the economy through increased borrowing costs, are generally bad news for risk assets like stocks and crypto. That’s because the payout on cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries becomes relatively more attractive as rates move and stay higher.Though the Fed in March had penciled in three quarter-percentage point cuts for 2024, traders have grown less hopeful. According to the CME’s FedWatch Tool, financial market participants may see only one rate cute—or zero—by year’s end.As rate cut expectations inched further out in April, Bitcoin notched its worst month since November 2022. Coming off all-time highs in March, Bitcoin fell 14% throughout the month to around $60,000.In April, Powell said that inflation hasn’t come down as quickly as policymakers expected, suggesting rate cuts could still be far out. Yet the Fed chair signaled interest rates, where they currently are, could also be sufficient to get the job done too.“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” he said. “That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.”Edited by Andrew Hayward with additional reporting by Mathew Di Salvo.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:10 </pubDate></item><item><title>Figment begins to power Bitvavo digital asset staking | Cryptopolitan</title><link>https://www.cryptopolitan.com/figment-begins-power-bitvavo-asset-staking/</link><description>Bitvavo has taken a big step regarding asset staking.

In a highly anticipated move, the Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates at their existing level on Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee two-day policy meeting. 
The rate hike pause marks the central bank’s sixth since consecutively raising interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023. Persistent inflation and a healthy labor market contributed to central bankers’ decision to hold rates, they said. 
“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” Wednesday’s statement read. “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” 
Central bankers will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting rates, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday during a press conference.
“The path forward is uncertain,” Powell said. 
“Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,” he added.
Stocks and cryptocurrencies were little changed on the news. Bitcoin (BTC) traded sideways in the moments after the Fed released its statement at 2 pm ET, sitting around $57,786 at time of publication, per Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. 
Ether (ETH) similarly traded flat, hovering around $2,900 at time of publication – about 1% lower over 24 hours. 
The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes inched marginally higher on the news, managing to move just barely into the green after an otherwise disappointing trading session. 
Bitcoin has hovered below $60,000 since early Wednesday, a downward trend analysts say is poised to continue. 
“A break to the downside through $59,200 in BTC has led to an accelerated selloff and, barring an unforeseen catalyst, there seems little in the way of this market testing the [$53,000] area before a meaningful turnaround,” Mike Tauckus, head of trading and structuring at BitOoda, said. 
Markets on Wednesday expected about a 9% chance a rate cut will come in June, according to data from CME Group.

Aave noted that CCLL would be powered by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which completed its permissionless rollout last week.“Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol,” the proposal said. “This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks.”Aave v4 will also feature automated adjustments to its interest rate curve, dynamic interest rate premiums for riskier assets, smart accounts and vaults allowing users to segregate their borrowing activities, and an updated liquidation engine. Aave said it hopes to begin prototyping its v4 protocol during Q4 and hopes to implement the code in Q2 2025. However, it does not expect the CCLL to roll out until 2026 or 2027.The proposal also outlines plans to launch an Aave Network, which would function as the primary hub for the Aave protocol and the project’s GHO stablecoin.Aave is also considering utilizing a rollup-like Validium architecture for the network, adopting GHO as its network token for fees, and using AAVE as the main staking asset for decentralized validators and sequencers. Aave noted it will monitor the evolution of both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks before finalizing the network’s architecture, but said Aave Network will inherit its security from Ethereum.The proposal added that “Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance” and both Aave and GHO would continue to operate as “multichain and network-agnostic despite Aave’s plans to launch a bespoke network. Aave is also targeting 2026 or 2027 for the launch of Aave Chain.Aave seeks to ensure future dominanceAave is the third-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of $10 billion, according to DeFiLlama.Recent research from Token Terminal indicated that Aave has consistently enjoyed a roughly 50% share of the DeFi lending market over the past three years. Aave’s Marc Zeller replied that roughly 75% of the value in DeFi lending protocols is locked in projects leveraging versions of Aave’s codebase.Aave said its three-year plan seeks to maintain its position as a leading DeFi for the rest of the decade. “These ideas aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users,” the proposal said.Aave’s three-year roadmap also includes promoting the development of real-world asset products built around GHO, expanding Aave onto networks that do not support Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, and introducing new visual branding licensed to the Aave DAO.Aave is budgeting 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE ($2.1 million) to complete the first year of the roadmap, with the DAO providing 3M GHO upfront and streaming the remaining assets over the course of the first 12 months.The price of AAVE is down 14% over the past week amid the recent digital asset downturn, according to CoinGecko. Aave noted that more than 450,000 wallets currently hold AAVE.[CORRECTS ON 05/1 @ 5:10PM EST TO SAY AAVE IS CONSIDERING VALIDIUM, NOT PROPOSING IT]</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:10 </pubDate></item><item><title>Yuga Labs restructures again, EU touts metaverse health benefits: Nifty Newsletter</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/yuga-labs-restructures-eu-touts-metaverse-health-benefits-nifty-newsletter</link><description>In this week’s newsletter, nonfungible token (NFT) company Yuga Labs has laid off employees, and the European Union believes the metaverse can help children’s health.

Ladan Stewart, a former key figure at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has publicly refuted claims suggesting a governmental agenda against crypto. 
She emphasizes that the regulatory body’s actions never aimed to stifle innovation in the nascent industry. 
Cryptos Will Not Be Eliminated in the US
Stewart, now a partner at White &amp; Case LLP, explained that during her tenure at the SEC, her primary focus was on litigating high-profile cases such as those against Ripple and Coinbase. She pointed out that the agency’s approach has always been technologically neutral.
Therefore, she clarified the widespread speculation about a deliberate crackdown the SEC has imposed on crypto businesses.

“The SEC is not trying to kill crypto. Our main concern has always been about ensuring investor protection and compliance within the industry,” Stewart stated. 

Her comments come at a time when industry leaders have voiced concerns about harsh crypto regulatory measures potentially driving innovation out of the US. 

According to Stewart, the industry’s compliance with regulations designed to protect investors is critical. The SEC’s efforts constantly ensure that investors have all the detailed information. While the SEC will continue to enforce compliance, there is no conspiracy to dismantle the crypto industry. 
Instead, the focus is on fostering a safe and compliant environment for investors. Which, in turn, supports the healthy growth of the sector.

In her view, open dialogue and cooperation between regulators and the crypto community are essential for resolving ongoing tensions. Stewart’s insights underline a significant shift in regulatory strategies, focusing on education and compliance rather than restriction.
As someone who has transitioned from a governmental role to a private legal practice, Stewart aims to bridge the gap between the crypto industry and regulatory frameworks. Her new role involves guiding crypto businesses through the complex landscape of US regulations, striving for a balance that respects innovation and legal compliance.

Elliptic and MIT-IBM used AI to separate legal and illicit transactions into groups and follow links among the latter to uncover potential money laundering.“Blockchains provide fertile ground for machine learning techniques, thanks to the availability of both transaction data and information on the types of entities that are transacting, collected by us and others,” Elliptic wrote. “This is in contrast to traditional finance where transaction data is typically siloed, making it challenging to apply these techniques.”The test was not attempted with so-called “privacy coins.”“Counterparty information is available for all transactions [on Bitcoin],” Elliptic co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom Robinson told Decrypt, adding that the technique could be applied to other open blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. “This isn’t the case for privacy coins such as Monero.”“Rather than identifying transactions made by illicit actors, a machine learning model is trained to identify ‘subgraphs,’ chains of transactions that represent Bitcoin being laundered,” Elliptic explained. “This approach allows us to focus on the ‘multi-hop’ laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors.”According to Elliptic, the report published today continues work that the company began with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in 2019. Elliptic initially worked with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange to test their theory.“Of 52 ‘money laundering’ subgraphs predicted by the model [that] ended with deposits to this exchange, the exchange confirmed that 14 had been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to money laundering,” the report said. “On average, less than one in 10,000 of these accounts are flagged as such, suggesting that the model performs very well.”Government regulators, particularly in the United States, have used money laundering laws as one of many cudgels to attack the cryptocurrency industry. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge in Seattle sentenced Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to four months in federal prison for money laundering violations.Last month, the founders of the Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet were arrested on charges of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice.In the indictment, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said “threat actors” use technology like Samourai Wallet to evade law enforcement detection and create environments conducive to criminal activity.“While offering Samourai as a ‘privacy’ service, the defendants knew that it was a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion,” the DOJ said in the indictment. ”Indeed, as the defendants intended and well knew, a substantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal proceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:11 </pubDate></item><item><title>Crypto Advocacy Group Coin Center Looking To File Amicus Brief To Support Samourai Wallet Co-Founders - The Daily Hodl</title><link>https://dailyhodl.com/2024/05/01/crypto-advocacy-group-coin-center-looking-to-file-amicus-brief-to-support-samourai-wallet-co-founders/</link><description>
								The nonprofit crypto advocacy group Coin Center is mulling whether to file an amicus brief in support of the co-founders of the crypto mixer Samourai Wallet.
Last week, authorities arrested Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill for allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business that executed more than $2 billion in unlawful transactions.










The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also alleges Samourai laundered more than $100 million worth of criminal proceeds.
Coin Center’s executive director Jerry Brito says the indictment “includes some questionable charges.”
When asked on the social media platform X whether Coin Center planned to file an amicus brief in support of the mixer, Brito notes that they’re considering it.
“Tindictment was unsealed on Friday, so we need a little time to consider everything. Who knows if this even goes to trial, etc. But yes, we filed in the Tornado Cash indictment and may well do so here too.”
An amicus brief is a legal document filed in court by a non-involved party in a case. Written by “friends of the court,” the briefs aim to contain additional information or arguments that can assist the court in making its decision.
Tornado Cash is an Ethereum (ETH)-based coin mixing system that helps users conceal their digital assets. The US sanctioned the controversial project 2022 for national security purposes.
One of its founders, Roman Storm, was arrested last year and slapped with charges related to allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit.

As expected, the FED left interest rates constant. In the statement published after the decision, it was stated that there have been deficiencies in reaching the 2% inflation target in the recent period.
Now, FED President Jerome Powell's press conference, which started at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3), is being followed closely.


As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are bringing you this conversation live. You can access Jerome Powell's latest remarks by refreshing the page. You can also find the official live broadcast link right below.

Inflation fell significantly last year but remains very high.
Further progress on inflation is not guaranteed; The path is unclear.
We are extremely careful about inflation risks.
The restrictive policy stance put downward pressure on inflation and the economy.
Risks to achieving bilateral goals have become better balanced in the past year.
The labor market remains relatively tight.
Nominal wage growth has decreased over the past year, but labor demand still exceeds supply.
This year's inflation data was higher than expected.
Our policy actions are guided by our goals.
FED officials are 'very aware' of the challenges posed by high inflation.
But long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
We do not think it would be appropriate to cut interest rates until we have greater confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
Gaining greater confidence is likely to take longer than previously expected.
Lowering policy too soon or too much, or too late or too little, both have risks.
Inflation data so far this year have not given us any more confidence.
Politics is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face.
We will make our decisions separately for each meeting.
The policy rate is at a restrictive level.
We believe it will be restrictive enough over time.
We believe that over time the policy is restrictive enough to reduce inflation to 2%.
The next policy move is unlikely to be a rate hike.
We are focused on how long to keep the policy restrictive.
To raise rates, we need to see evidence that the policy is not enough to bring inflation back to our target.
We think policy is well placed to consider the different paths the economy can take.
If inflation is more persistent and the labor market remains strong, it may be appropriate to postpone interest rate cuts.
But there are other avenues that point to a rate cut, but these would only come if we gain more confidence and there is an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
There is no obvious link between easing financial conditions and inflation.
I'm not ruling out that we could still have strong growth or that the labor market and inflation could continue to fall.
It is unlikely that the next move will be a rate hike.
To meet the inflation target, we will likely need to see wage growth slow to more sustainable levels.
I don't know how long it will take us to lower interest rates.
Powell: (when asked about 3 interest rate cuts this year) said only that the FED needs more confidence on inflation and does not see progress in Q1.
We need to take a cue from three worse-than-expected inflation data.
Once we gain confidence about inflation, interest rate cuts will be within scope.
The indication we are getting is that it will take longer to get on a sustainable path towards 2% inflation.
My expectation is that inflation will decline again this year.
My confidence that inflation will decline again is lower than before.
Question: Has the possibility of a rate cut decreased this year? Powell: I don't have a probability estimate. We need to be more confident, our confidence did not increase in the first quarter, on the contrary it will last longer than expected.
I don't know if inflation will drop enough to merit interest rate cuts.
I'm not sure whether there will be a rate cut this year or not.
In light of the data we have, I really don't understand where the talk of a stagflation scenario comes from.
I don't see stagflation related to growth or inflation.
3% inflation does not satisfy us.
Restrictive monetary policy needs more time to fulfill its duty.
We have peace of mind that we will do what we think is right, when we think it is right.
We've seen pretty consistent progress in slowing wage growth, but it's been bumpy.
It will take some time, but we will reduce inflation to 2%.


Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded modestly in the minutes since the news broke, but remains under pressure, falling more than 4% to $58,000 in 24 hours.





Markets entered 2024 expecting a long series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but those hopes have faded sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rose slightly in the first four months of the year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing the probability of a zero rate cut this year at around 25%. A month ago, the probability that the FED would not cut interest rates in 2024 was only 1%.
However, following the decision, many investors predict that the FED will make the only interest rate cut this year in November.

Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?In an indictment filed in federal court in Los Angeles, 45-year-old Ver is charged with mail fraud and tax evasion. The DOJ stated that the indictment was unsealed after his arrest in Spain over the weekend, and the U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.Ver earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” due to his early investments in cryptocurrency and his tendency to preach about it. Born in California, Ver renounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.According to the indictment, Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he owned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is alleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and evaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means Ver’s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.Ver’s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange Binance founder Changpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering, received a four-month jail sentence. Previously, Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:13 </pubDate></item><item><title>Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support? - DailyCoin</title><link>https://dailycoin.com/polygon-matic-plunges-in-btc-led-flush-can-it-hold-support/?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss</link><description>
        
Polygon (MATIC) has dived to near-yearly lows.



MATIC’s price action follows a broader market dip led by Bitcoin.



A critical U.S. macroeconomic data release expected today could be essential to MATIC’s short-term fate.
Polygon (MATIC) sees red.After a parabolic run in Q1 2024, crypto assets, including Polygon’s native token MATIC, are now experiencing a rout. A recent Bitcoin-led market flush has sent MATIC near yearly lows amid this decline.Polygon (MATIC) Dives Below $0.65Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has tanked about 7%, from around $0.6759 to lows of around $0.6322, near 2024 lows of $0.5885.
MATIC’s price rout is part of a broader market dump that has seen Bitcoin’s price drop by about $2,500 in the two hours from about $60,000 to just below $57,500. The jitters come as the market awaits the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision slated for 6:00 pm UTC, Wednesday, May 1. With the Fed expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like crypto.  Can MATIC Hold the Line?MATIC boasts support within the $0.6467 and $0.6314 price range. At the time of writing, the asset is already showing resilience, bouncing from $0.6322 to trade at $0.6653. Bulls would want this momentum to continue, as a break below the current support could see the asset tank as low as $0.5.MATIC/USDT 4-hour candle chart. Source: TradingViewThe Fed’s rate hike decision is critical to MATIC’s continued run in the short term. While leaving rates unchanged or raising rates could lead to mild or significant price corrections, a shock decision to engage in rate cuts could fuel a parabolic run to the upside. On the Flipside 
MATIC is not the only asset that experienced a price drop in the Bitcoin-led correction. Leading assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana are also experiencing price corrections of about 3.2%, 2.8%, and 4%, respectively, per CoinGecko data at the time of writing.
Why This Matters The price action of the past 24 hours puts MATIC in a precautionary position. If it fails to hold support, the asset risks a 30% drop to $0.5.Read this for more on MATIC:Polygon (MATIC)-Linked Avail Integrated by Leading L2s for DAStay up to date with the latest in the Binance Nigeria drama:Binance Exec Who Fled Nigeria Will Be “Smoked Out”: Interpol VP

However, the network’s congestion and subsequent crashes have opened the door for competitors like Base to position themselves as viable alternatives for retail traders.Noting the marginal new retail interest in crypto, Krüger states that most of the participants are ETF buyers and those from previous cycles redeploying their funds and taking on more risk. Those who missed the Bitcoin ETF run, crypto market participants with “PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” went all-in on altcoins. But those disappointed with significant losses, as numerous altcoins erased their 2024 gains in the past month.Also Read: How Did Shiba Inu Become The ‘Dogecoin Killer?’ Crypto Whale Thinks ‘Its Mission’ And This One Factor Were KeyWhy It Matters: While many meme coins have gone to zero, Krüger writes they have dominated the narrative alongside Bitcoin as large-cap meme coins are among the strongest performers of the year. They have also established themselves as "a viable asset class in their own right."He attributed the market's volatility to the increasing presence of scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders mainly since February. These founders prioritize short-term hype and quick profits over long-term sustainability.Krüger maintains that the current crypto cycle “is not over” and there are still numerous opportunities for investors who navigate the market carefully and stay attuned to the evolving trends and narratives.This analysis comes amid Bitcoin's huge price plunge of 5% in a single day pushing prices below the $58,000 mark.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Plummets Below $58K, ETH, SOL, DOGE Follow: Over $400M Liquidated In ‘Deepest Retrace In The Cycle’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:15 </pubDate></item><item><title>This is Why Jack Dorsey is Under Crypto Investigation</title><link>https://beincrypto.com/jack-dorsey-under-investigation-crypto-business/</link><description>
Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing financial transactions linked to Block, a firm founded by Jack Dorsey, focusing on potential violations at its divisions, Cash App and Square. 
According to sources, this investigation stems from documents indicating that Block processed crypto transactions for terrorist organizations and Square handled transactions involving countries under US sanctions.
Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Scrutiny
The Southern District of New York’s inquiry began after an ex-employee provided documents revealing that Square and Cash App failed to collect adequate information for risk assessment. The employee claimed that despite being aware, Block did not report numerous transactions involving sanctioned countries to the government as required.

“From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was awed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program,” the former employee said.

These allegations come at a time when Cash App boasts 56 million active accounts and processed transactions worth $248 billion last year alone. The platform is popular for its instant money transfer service and ability to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.

Despite its success, Cash App’s design might contribute to compliance risks. Balances are typically depleted before any review can occur, limiting sanctions enforcement’s effectiveness. For this reason, the former employee argued that the compliance lapses were well-known within Block’s leadership circles, including Jack Dorsey.


“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations,” a Block spokesperson stated.

The potential fallout of this investigation could be significant for Jack Dorsey’s Block as it navigates regulatory challenges and seeks to maintain its reputation. This scrutiny coincides with the resignation of two key board members, intensifying the spotlight on Block’s governance and compliance practices.

Roger Ver is arrested on allegations of tax evasion.



Some observers believe US authorities’ actions are unjustified. 



The incident has triggered debate on the morality of taxation.
Roger Ver was an early adopter and evangelist of Bitcoin, amassing a vast fortune by believing in the digital currency at a time when most dismissed it as worthless “magical internet money.” Ver acquired St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship in 2014 and renounced his US citizenship shortly after. Although Ver thought he was free of US control, authorities arrested the Bitcoin Cash proponent over the weekend on mail fraud and tax evasion charges, stoking government overreach concerns.DoJ Coming For Roger VerRoger Ver was arrested in Spain over the weekend on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking Ver’s extradition to the US to stand trial over the charges, particularly unpaid taxes totaling $48 million. Ver’s lawyer, Bryan Skarlatos, stated that his client had relied on tax professionals to report his Bitcoin holdings properly and always intended to comply with regulations.
The outstanding tax liabilities stem from Ver’s 2014 renunciation of his US citizenship. Under citizen renunciation, individuals are required to pay an exit tax, with assets held treated as being sold at fair market value and any subsequent gains subject to an “expatriation tax.” The DoJ alleged that Ver and two of his companies, MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com, held around 131,000 BTC at that time.In this case, prosecutors claimed Ver provided misleading information to undervalue his companies’ Bitcoin holdings when preparing the expatriation filings. The indictment claimed that in November 2017, Ver took possession of 70,000 BTC from his companies and sold them for around $240 million but failed to pay taxes owed on those distributions.The DoJ stated that although Ver was not a US citizen when cashing out the 70,000 BTC, he was still legally required to report distributions from his companies and pay taxes on the sale of the BTC.  
Given the spate of perceived attacks on the crypto industry by US authorities lately, some have labeled Ver’s arrest as an unjustified overreach on the part of the US government. Crypto Clampdown?Several observers labeled Ver’s arrest a massive overreach by the US government. Simply Bitcoin host Nico tied this incident to the recent arrest of Samourai Wallet devs, stating that the two events equate to the government “sending a message” to the cryptocurrency community.Kurt Wuckert Jr., the founder of BSV miner Gorilla Pool, dived into a philosophical point on the morality of taxation itself, commenting that “Failure to bribe the government so they don’t put you in a cage is not a crime. Demanding the bribe is evil.” Likewise, podcaster “Walker” stated that “The United States of America holds its citizens prisoner.”Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson took a different view by addressing the charges against Ver. Hoskinson noted that Ver’s two companies were US-based, meaning Ver still had a tax obligation to the US even though he had renounced his US citizenship. Nonetheless, Hoskinson hoped that the allegations against Ver would be proven false.On the Flipside
The MemoryDealers.com URL diverts to a tweet from Ver expressing distrust of the US government. 



Servicing the US national debt is expected to cost $531 billion in 2024, making it the fifth largest government spending program.
Why This MattersSome maintain that taxation is theft, but the reality is that tax is the price to pay for living in a civilized society. However, the timing of Ver’s arrest is somewhat puzzling, given that the allegations occurred nearly seven years ago.US taxpayers cry foul on Biden’s tax plans:Biden’s 44% Crypto Tax Sparks Outcry: Is Backlash Justified?CZ responds to sentencing for money laundering violations:CZ Vows to Focus on ‘Next Chapter’ After Sentencing

Recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As reported by Bloomberg, several major US-listed Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.



Bloomberg data shows that funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) traded well below their NAV. ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds.



Experts offer explanations for this phenomenon. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs. These factors can lead to temporary discrepancies between market prices and NAV.



However, Bloomberg underscores that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses unique complexities for ETF investors compared to traditional asset classes. This same volatility also creates lucrative opportunities for authorized participants, the specialized traders responsible for maintaining price alignment between ETFs and their NAV.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Virtu Financial Inc. CEO Douglas A. Cifu, as reported by Bloomberg, highlights these volatility-driven opportunities as a reason for continued optimism in crypto ETFs, despite the recent discounts.



The current macroeconomic climate, with the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, adds further pressure to the crypto market. As Bloomberg notes, speculative assets like Bitcoin often struggle in such environments.



WallachBeth Capital’s ETF director Mohit Bajaj suggests that the observed discounts could persist depending on Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

The investigation focuses on alleged compliance deficiencies at the company's two main units, Square and Cash App.
A former employee provided documents to prosecutors for the Southern District of New York that purported to show that insufficient information was collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risk. The documents also allege that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and that Block processed numerous cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.


Many of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not properly reported to the government. The former employee alleges that Block failed to correct company processes when alerted to these violations.
The nearly 100-page document provided to NBC News identified transactions, mostly in low-dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, until last year.





“Everything in the compliance department was flawed from top to bottom. It's run by people who shouldn't be responsible for a regulated compliance program,” the former employee told NBC News. This assessment was echoed by a second person with direct knowledge of Block's monitoring programs and practices.

“My understanding from the documents is that the deficiencies in compliance were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years,” said Edward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who represented the former employee.


In response to the inquiry, a Block spokesperson said:

“Block has a responsible and comprehensive compliance program, and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and the evolving sanctions regulatory landscape. Our compliance program includes systems, tools and processes for sanctions screening, as well as the investigation and reporting of sanctions matters in accordance with our legal obligations.” “Continuously improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block, and we are committed to improving this work as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

Bitcoin price dropped to as low as US$56,600 on Wednesday leading to the FOMC meeting, where the central bank left its interest rates unchanged at 5.25% and 5.5%.



“Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective,” the Fed said in a press release on Wednesday.



In March, inflation accelerated in the U.S. with the consumer price index rising from 3.2% in February to 3.5% on an annual basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



Standard Chartered projects a further decline to US$50,000, according to The Block.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin started dropping from over US$60,000 and has slightly recovered to US$57,708 after the Federal Reserve’s announcement, CoinGecko data shows.



The price drop comes despite positive developments for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry, including the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on Tuesday.



The Bitcoin network underwent the quadrennial halving on April 20, cutting miner rewards by 50% from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins.



The halving impacts the scarcity of the asset by slowing down the inflow of new Bitcoins.

	
	
	

	


Standard Chartered’s year-end price prediction for Bitcoin is US$150,000.

Hong Bitcoin ETFs have recently gone live for sale. 



The investment vehicle’s debut failed to meet market expectations.



Bitcoin ETF analysts have weighed in on the asset’s first-day performance.
The record-breaking success of Bitcoin ETFs upon launch in the United States has sparked a global interest in the asset class. Recently launched in Hong Kong, the promise of even broader adoption has driven excitement for the launched asset, heightening hopes for impressive inflows.However, contrary to expectations, the debut of the exchange-traded funds has not gone off to a good start.Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF: A Flop?The newly launched asset class raked in a total of $141 million on its first day of trade, Tuesday, April 20, raising questions of performance among experts. Led by issuer ChinaAMC with $123 million, the cumulative volume contrasts sharply with the forecasted $300 million before launch, falling significantly behind the U.S. record of $4.6 billion.
Weighing in on the performance, analyst James Seyffart opined that the six Hong Kong spot ETFs did not “live up to expectations,” significantly underperforming below the record standards set by their U.S. counterparts.ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also reiterated a previous warning against the overhype of the newly launched asset. Factoring the market size, Balchunas emphasized that the Hong Kong market is relatively smaller compared to the US and should not be equated similarly.However, both Seyffart and Balchunas added that the performance was significant within the local market context. They stated that ChinaAMC’s performance positions it as the 6th most successful out of 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years and in the top 20% overall in terms of launches.
The underperformance of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch has rippled through the crypto market with a downward wave.Crypto Market Hit as Bitcoin Retraces to $50K MarkLeading the major market negative shift on April 30, Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a sharp fall below the $60,000 mark for the first time this week, dropping to the $56,000 point.This marked a sharp 12.5% decline in the token’s price, worsening ITS week-long downward trend. Currently trading at $56,980, BTC is down 29.4% from its all-time high of $73,738, squashing the once-heightened optimism for an imminent bull run. Bitcoin was not the only asset hit. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also took major hits, falling 29.7% and 17%, respectively. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX) experienced losses within the 6% range before rebounding later with modest gains.Read more about how investors are approaching the market decline:Retail Bitcoin Investors Buy the Dip, Whales Step Back Ex-Binance CEO has been sentenced to prison; find out how much time:Here’s Why Changpeng Zhao Got A Lighter Prison Sentence

								A closely followed crypto strategist is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) may have already printed a bull market top.
Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 60,700 followers on the social media platform X that realized profits, or gains converted to cash, have historically coincided with Bitcoin market tops.










The analyst highlights that when Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of more than $73,000, realized profits soared to a new high and eclipsed levels witnessed during the 2018, 2021 and 2022 bull market tops.
“Last month, when BTC hit $73,880, realized profits skyrocketed to $3.52 billion. This could signal a potential BTC market top!”

Martinez says that he needs another signal to confirm his bearish stance.
“Still, I’m waiting for another confirmation before calling a Bitcoin market top.
For instance, a sustained close below the BTC short-term holder realized price, which currently hovers around $59,800, can confirm a potential BTC market top.”

But the analyst says his call will be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to reclaim a key price level.
“If Bitcoin can surge above $66,250 and reclaim this area as support, the bearish outlook will be invalidated…
By rising above $66,250, Bitcoin will gain the strength to push towards $69,150. 
And if this resistance barrier is breached, then BTC can advance toward a new all-time high of $92,190.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $60,543, down more than 5% in the past day.

                            On Wednesday, Bitcoin sharply declined, dropping below the crucial $60,000 support level. Despite this recent market downtrend, Bitcoin investors remain confident as they believe the flagship crypto can still reach new heights in this market cycle. Some say this might be what Bitcoin needs before making another parabolic run to the upside. 
Bitcoin’s Decline Is Nothing To Be Scared Of
Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, reassured in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s recent price decline was not unusual, stating it was “pretty ordinary stuff.” He also pointed out that this was Bitcoin’s fourth 20% correction in the past 12 months, underscoring how normal these price movements are.

Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, had previously warned that price declines of such magnitude were to be expected, stating that “bull markets are not straight lines up.” He noted that the same thing happened in the 2021 and 2017 bull runs when Bitcoin experienced about 13 price drawdowns of over 10% or more. 
Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital claimed in an X post that “this is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle.” He added, “The longer this goes on, the better.” In another X post, he reassured his followers that Bitcoin is getting closer to its final bottom with each passing day. 
Like Rekt Capital, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also sounded confident that Bitcoin’s recent decline was just a part of the bigger picture for its move to the upside. They claimed this would be the “final shakeout before up, only rally to a cycle top.”
Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of Apollo, also shared his bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, as he suggested that the crypto token’s volatility is what makes it a great investment. “Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet. Bitcoin is still the best asymmetric opportunity in the market,” he wrote on X. 
Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Bitcoin’s bull run was far from over while comparing Bitcoin’s current price action to the last two halving events. According to him, Bitcoin consolidated for 189 and 87 days around the halving in 2016 and 2020, respectively, before the bull run resumed. 

Source: X
He further noted that Bitcoin has only consolidated for 60 days this time around, meaning that the flagship crypto will continue its run eventually. In a subsequent X post, the analyst stated that Bitcoin might be 538 days away from hitting its next market top if it follows its trend from the previous two bull runs.

Before now, Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin could rise to a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,600, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

								In a momentous event that heralds a new era for Polkadot, Kusama, its test network, sold all three cores in its first Agile Coretime sale, as reported on April 30. This achievement, shared by Parity Technologies, the developer of the interoperable blockchain, is a crucial step in their roadmap towards bringing Agile Coretime to the mainnet.
Kusama Sells All Three Cores: Beggining Of A New Era?
In an update on X, all three cores were sold on April 30, generating 70 KSM, worth approximately $1,980. Each core was sold for 23.4 KSM, or roughly $660. Buyers of each core can now produce blocks on Kusama for the next four weeks.

The Agile Coretime concept, a replacement for the parachain auction system, is a welcomed change, especially for participants eager to produce blocks or deploy protocols. In this model, participants can bid for core time, a system that promises more efficiency, as envisioned by Gavin Wood, the developer of Polkadot and Kusama. 

The goal is to accelerate the pace at which new decentralized applications (dapps) can join the network. This will also help amplify enterprise adoption of Polkadot solutions.
The Agile Coretime concept eventually replaces the previous parachain auction system, bringing a host of benefits. For instance, it eliminates the need for upfront, long-term slot commitments, as with Parachains. 
This will, in turn, help foster more flexible resource utilization, particularly for new projects. Most importantly, this model creates opportunities for early-stage ventures and individual developers to participate.
It remains to be seen when this model will go live on Polkadot. However, early success in Kusama sets the pace for the eventual integration in the coming months.  
Polkadot Prepares For Asynchronous Backing, DOT Rejects Bears
Beyond this, Polkadot plans to activate Asynchronous Backing on the mainnet in the coming weeks, an update that enables the network to process more transactions, pushing up the overall throughput. Additionally, it allows for increased block capacity and shorter block times, changes that are a net positive for the network.

With this announcement, DOT prices are stable, cementing its position in the top-20. At press time, the coin changes hands at around $6.5, rejecting bears. Notably, DOT is finding support at April 2024 lows. 

Still, for bulls to take over, prices must ease past $7.5, reversing losses of April 13. This development might anchor bulls who are currently targeting March 2024 highs.

The proposed legislation would specify that staking rewards would be considered created property under U.S. tax code, and taxes on block rewards would be collected at acquisition.“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry,” said Representative Ferguson. “The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas.”Source: Representative Wiley NickelCrypto advocacy group Coin Center described the bill as having “sensible policies” by taxing block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks when sold or spent rather than when they were acquired. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the legislation “right on point” for providing needed guidance.“[B]lock rewards are more appropriately classified as value creation due to a user’s actions and efforts, rather than income from an employer,” said Coin Center. “This simple policy would resolve major issues with how cryptocurrencies are taxed today and put the technology on a level playing field.”Related: Solo Bitcoin miner wins the 3.125 BTC lottery, solving valid blockThe legislation came roughly 10 days after Bitcoin miner rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block after the blockchain’s fourth halving event.

								ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is reportedly raising her price target for Bitcoin (BTC) based upon an assumption of greater institutional investment in the top digital asset by market cap.
According to a new report from Benzinga, Wood’s latest prediction is that Bitcoin will soar to $3.8 million by 2030 if institutions decide to allocate slightly more than 5% of their portfolios to BTC.










The new Wood prediction, made at a New York Investor Day in March, increases her previous prediction by $2.3 million.
Says Wood,
“Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission] has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.”
Wood is referring to the SEC approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes one operated by ARK. The ETFs, which launched in January, have attracted tens of billions of dollars in investment and are seen as the most successful launches of an ETF. The ETFs allow institutions to access Bitcoin.
If Wood’s prediction turns out to be accurate, it would mean that Bitcoin would increase from its current value by more than 6,572% in about six years.
Bitcoin is trading for $56,946 at time of writing, down more than 6% in the last 24 hours.

EigenLayer is on everyone's minds this week due to announcements around the much-hyped token launch. But amid all of the EIGEN talk, let's take a look at how to get started putting your restaked ETH to work! In the EigenLayer ecosystem, an Actively Validated Service (AVS) is a project that uses the security of Ethereum via EigenLayer to underpin its native functionalities.  AVSs can be anything from data availability solutions to L2s, like optimistic or zk-rollups, and plenty more in between. “Operators” are the entities responsible for running these services. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the AVSs by managing the underlying nodes and operations.Notably, AVSs expand the capabilities of Ethereum by providing scalable and efficient solutions for various blockchain applications. Operators ensure these services are reliable and secure, making them integral to the trust and functionality of the AVSs they support.The First AVSs on EigenLayerIn April 2024, EigenLayer started its phased rollout of the first AVSs, beginning with its own EigenDA solution. After that, eight more services have come online atop the restaking protocol. Five of the most active AVSs so far have been:EigenDA — A new data availability network, EigenDA boasts high throughput and low costs, ideal for scaling Ethereum's data handling capacities. Current TVL: 2.71M ETHeoracle — A decentralized oracle network that securely integrates real-world data into Ethereum, powering various decentralized apps. Current TVL: 1.87M ETHWitness Chain — Coordinates decentralized physical infrastructure networks, offering a new layer of economic activities for blockchain projects. Current TVL: 1.82M ETHBrevis coChain AVS — This service uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable smart contracts to access and compute vast historical blockchain data efficiently. Current TVL: 1.30M ETHAltLayer MACH — Focused on providing fast finality for transactions within rollups, enhancing the speed and reliability of Ethereum-based transactions. Current TVL: 1.29M ETHChoosing an AVS and OperatorWhen selecting an AVS and an operator, make sure you first understand the specific services and benefits each offers. For example, EigenYields is one of the operators of EigenDA, and it promises to share airdrops with its delegators. While direct incentives around AVSs are scant for now, look for operators to offer more explicit rewards like this going forward. While EigenLayer vetted its first wave of AVSs, the ecosystem is moving towards a permissionless model where operators will self-register. This means assessing the risk and potential of each operator will become increasingly important over time. Additionally, EigenLayer does not guarantee the fitness of any operators, and bad operators can cause slashing events for their delegators once this functionality is activated later, so performing due diligence before delegating is crucial. It also takes seven days to redelegate to another operator, so make sure you’re confident before diving in. How to Delegate Restaked ETH to AVS OperatorsAccess the EigenLayer AVS Dashboard — Navigate to the AVS dashboard and connect your wallet.Select an AVS — Review the available AVSs and select one that aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.Choose an Operator — Each AVS has a list of operators you can click into. Select an operator based on their performance and any additional incentives they might offer.Delegate Your Stake — Click the "Delegate" button next to your chosen operator. You'll be prompted to confirm the delegation with your wallet. That’s it, that’s all it takes to get started here! Now just sit back while your restaked ETH is put to work. Again, remember that you can redelegate to a different operator as you please, but the process will take seven days. Also, be sure to stay tuned to EigenLayer’s social accounts about new AVSs coming online, as they may offer new opportunities or require adjustments in your delegation strategy!Getting Started with EIGEN on BanklessEigenLayer just announced EIGEN, here’s how to get ready for this highly anticipated stakedrop!

Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a new blog post discussing a new cryptographic proving system that can make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient.
The proving system, called Binius, is designed to operate directly over binary code on computers. Binary code is a language understood by computers, and it is used to store information and represents data using the symbols zero and one, otherwise known as bits. 
Although there are some similarities between STARKs and Binius, Buterin explains that the mathematical tricks that enable these different proving systems are very different. 
Generally speaking, STARKs is a technology that has enabled complicated statements to be easily cryptographically verified. It is designed in a way that can easily compute numbers when they are of small value, when there are large values, STARKs generate extra values, which can lead to inefficiency. 
Unlike STARKs that “arithmetize” a statement into a polynomial equation — a mathematical expression which model a relationship between variables in a block — Binius treats data as a hypercube and grid, and uses multilinear polynomials to perform cryptographic proofs.

Binius converts individual values into bits and places them in a hypercube and a square. This hypercube is then converted into a grid and computations are performed in order to receive an output matrix. 

A verifier will then perform its own computational calculations to ensure that the information itself matches and ensure that the compute columns returns a value claimed by the prover.
“I highly encourage people to understand and explore! Lots of innovations have been happening in ZK-proving recently. And I expect lots more to come soon,” Buterin wrote in an X post.

&amp;nbsp
After months of legal back-and-forth, Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, received a four-month sentence for anti-money laundering violations. Pundits claimed that the sentence was a “clear warning” to the rest of the industry to comply with anti-money laundering rules.



Aaron Lane, a law professor at Melbourne’s RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, disclosed that the case’s conclusion serves as a “general deterrence” to virtual asset service providers in the ecosystem. Lane added that in the future, cryptocurrencies will not be seen as the Wild West by executives and all classes of investors.



“General deterrence appears to be the main rationale behind the term of imprisonment,” said Lane. “The judge has sent a message, not to CZ individually but to the entire industry, that Anti-Money Laundering compliance must be taken seriously.”



Despite the four-month sentence, a cross-section of the industry says the embattled founder received a slap on the wrist for charges bordering on money laundering. Sentencing guidelines after pleading guilty prescribe 18 months, with prosecutors pushing for a hard three-year sentence for Zhao.



The judge justified the four-month sentence as within his discretion, noting that Zhao had accepted a guilty plea, stepped down from his role as Binance CEO, and paid a $50 million fine.

&amp;nbsp



US authorities have previously taken down another industry behemoth in April, securing a 25-year prison sentence for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud, a move that sent ripples through the industry.



Apart from Zhao and SBF, several crypto executives have their heads on the chopping block as regulators continue to seek tighter controls for the space. Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon continues to face fraud charges by US authorities after months as a fugitive. At the same time, Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky has a score to settle with prosecutors in the US.



As we advance, service providers in the industry are expected to comply with existing anti-money laundering rules and Know Your Customers (KYC) processes or face enforcement actions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice.



Accepting the sentence



The embattled founder announced his intention to serve his time in jail, announcing on X that he would maintain a passive stance toward the industry. Zhao noted that he would focus on his blockchain-based education project while assuring Binance users that all funds were safe.



“Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important,” wrote Zhao. “A silver lining of this whole process is that Binance has been under the microscope. And funds are SAFU.”



However, the SEC continues to hover in the shadows, probing for evidence of misappropriation of customers’ funds by Binance.US, but executives continue to deny any wrongdoing.

According to a recent article by Joe Rennison and Karl Russell for The New York Times (NYT), the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength against nearly every major currency in the world this year. The Times reports that two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, largely due to expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.







The article explains that high Fed rates, a response to persistent inflation, have made American assets more attractive to investors worldwide. As a result, money has been flowing into the United States, creating ripple effects felt by policymakers, politicians, and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo.







The Times highlights the far-reaching consequences of a strong dollar, including intensified inflation abroad, higher interest bills for countries that have borrowed in dollars, and potential benefits for foreign businesses exporting to the U.S. However, the article also notes that American companies selling abroad may be put at a disadvantage, potentially widening the U.S. trade deficit.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The impact of the dollar’s strength, as reported by The New York Times, depends on the underlying reasons for high U.S. interest rates. If rates remain elevated due to stubborn inflation despite slowing economic growth, policymakers worldwide may face a difficult choice between supporting their domestic economies or bolstering their currencies.



The article emphasizes that Asia has been particularly affected by the strong dollar, with the Japanese yen and Korean won reaching multi-year lows. The Times also points out that China has allowed the yuan to weaken, raising questions about the strength of its economy.



Per the NYT article, European policymakers are considering cutting rates but must be mindful of the potential impact on the euro’s value relative to the dollar. The article also notes that central banks in South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia are grappling with similar challenges.

This downturn triggered $172 million in leveraged long position liquidations, which is notably low given that Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest was at $28.9 billion before the price crash. Consequently, it would be simplistic to assume that bulls were taken by surprise.Uncertainty should drop after the Fed minutes publishSome analysts believe that investors are in a holding pattern until Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, concludes his speech following the two-day monetary council meeting on May 1. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will maintain interest rates at 5.25%, there is considerable skepticism regarding the U.S. Treasury Department’s ability to finance the government’s budget.On April 30, the yield on the U.S. Treasury two-year note climbed to its highest level in five months, reaching 5.06%, as investors sought higher returns to offset increased risk following the announcement of a $1.07 trillion deficit for the first half of 2024. Since the Fed’s rate hikes throughout 2023, interest expenses on the deficit have risen by 23% in the first half of 2024 and are projected to continue to rise as long as rates remain elevated.Bitcoin is not alone in facing declines: Worsening macroeconomic conditions have made investors more risk-averse. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks mid- and small-cap U.S.-listed companies, fell by 8.2% over the last 30 days, wiping out gains from the previous two months. Similarly, WTI oil prices have dropped 8.3% since April 5, when they reached a five-month peak of $87.91.A key indication that Bitcoin’s price correction may be reaching a bottom stems from the traditional markets, following a series of robust first-quarter corporate earnings reports from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, TSMC, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays. A temporary recovery in the stock market shifts investor focus away from Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, although traders may seek alternatives if the Fed decides to maintain higher rates for an extended period.Bitcoin miner capitulation FUD and strong crypto influx in ChinaBitcoin miners are under significant strain after the April 20 halving, which reduced their rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC per block. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, mentioned that estimates of miners’ outflows to exchanges show no signs of capitulation “for now.” Young Ju added that if the Bitcoin price downtrend “stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of Bitcoin.”Thus, another sign that Bitcoin’s downturn may be nearing its end is the steadfastness of miners, which remain reluctant to sell despite a 57% drop in the Hashrate Index, as reported by Luxor Technology. This metric assesses the daily expected return of one terahash of hashing power, factoring in network difficulty, Bitcoin’s price and transaction fees.To understand the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, examining the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly for USD Coin (USDC), can be enlightening.

This sustained interest points to a positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in China, bolstering an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, which recently saw a 20% decline in price over three weeks.However, despite potential improvements in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s notes and the realization that fears of miner capitulation are, thus far, unfounded, the situation in U.S. markets shows a different trend. Specifically, net outflows from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million in the past five trading days. Such findings suggest that investment flows are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price movements, with no certainty that the $56,500 support level will hold.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

As the problems have continued, those identifying it have contributed to the benefit of the cause of decentralized finance. In a big discovery, a cybersecurity expert identified a vulnerability in Curve Finance protocol which could be used for withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.Cryptocurrency protocols and vulnerability There has been an estimate of losses amounting to $758 million due to vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols in Q3 of 2023. There have been a staggering 116 cases which show that there is an urgent need for enhancement of security. A workforce needs to be deployed for this purpose to identify vulnerabilities and address problems. In a recent discovery, Curve Finance protocol has identified a vulnerability in the DeFi system. The vulnerability is of historical importance as it has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for years. The vulnerability has resulted in hackers’ access to the protocol’s liquidity pool and drawing out funds. There have been a range of security attacks in 2023 and major areas of focus for hackers included smart contract vulnerabilities, reentry attacks, and Oracle manipulation attacks. The first one is of critical importance because if a hacker is able to identify a vulnerability, they can use it for negative purposes, affecting the funds and security of the protocol.  Claim of a key vulnerability in Curve Finance and other protocols came from a cybersecurity expert Marc Croc. Belonging to Kupia security, Marc Croc said that the vulnerability resulted in the loss of funds from the liquidity pool. The mentioned cybersecurity expert also added that it has led to the loss of millions from various protocols. Reentrancy Vulnerability in Curve FinanceReenetracy vulnerability was verified by the developers’ team from Curve Finance. In a detailed overview, they were able to identify and confirm it. According to official sources, the bug could manipulate the balances of a DeFi protocol. The manipulation of balances could also result in the withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.According to Curve Protocol sources, the bug didn’t pose an existential threat but it could create panic if any such incident took place. Furthermore, the company believed that they could recover funds in case such an incident took place. In July Curve Finance was able to recover funds amounting to $62 million which had been stolen after a vulnerability was exposed to hackers. Furthermore, the protocol members agreed to return assets valuing $49.2 million to liquidity providers. It announced the recovery of ETH assets, CRV, and other assets that were recovered by whitehat hackers. Curve protocol has brought forward a proposal the community fund will supply CRV tokens. The attackers identified a vulnerability in the Vyper language where problems were found in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0.Developer rewarded $250KIt was a critical problem that would have created problems for the development team because of the increased panic amongst the users and investors. To face the problem promptly, a cybersecurity expert identified the problem, not revealing their identity. Once the problem was confirmed, the protocol awarded the whitehat maximum bug bounty of $250K. The whitehat shared the details in the X thread, thanking Curve Finance. Furthermore, the account shared the details of how the vulnerability would affect the protocol. ConclusionIn a recent tweet from a whitehat cybersecurity expert, Marc Croc announced the discovery of a vulnerability in Curve Finance. The development team confirmed and addressed the problem, announcing a bounty amount of $250K for the mentioned whitehat. Though the problem wasn’t an existential threat, it would have created a panic.

Blockchain payments startup Ripple has sent ripples across the crypto market after withdrawing a substantial sum from its escrow accounts.



Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP from escrow, triggering debates over its potential impact on the coin’s price. 



The latest escrow unlock comes amid a market-wide crypto downturn.



500 Million XRP Released From Escrow



According to data from crypto tracking platform Whale Alert on May 1, Ripple released $248,531,377 XRP, worth approximately $248,531,377 earlier today.







This XRP release today is not a whimsical act, but rather part of Ripple’s long-standing strategy aimed at boosting market liquidity and ensuring seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple scheduled the unlocks to occur on the first day of each month for 55 months.

&amp;nbsp



Typically, Ripple releases a billion XRP every month. Speculation abounds, however, as to why the company released half of that amount this month. Could it symbolize an unforeseen event, or is Ripple strategically pacing its unlocks? Nevertheless, based on Ripple’s previous moves, it’s reasonable to expect the release of the second tranche of XRP from the firm’s inventory later this month. Moreover, Ripple always ensures that all unused XRP tokens are returned to the escrow system.



XRP Price Today



The timing of Ripple’s latest customary unlock coincides with a turbulent period in the crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed to as low as $56,637 in the hours leading up to the Federal Reserve meeting. The BTC price is hovering around $58,249 at press time, having dropped by 3% over the past 24 hours. 



XRP has shown remarkable resilience in its pricing today, despite ongoing legal hurdles. The seventh-largest crypto is trading for $0.5164 at press time with a 3.9% daily gain. Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP has lost 3.4% over the past 7 days, while Bitcoin has shed 9.2% of its value during the same timeframe. If the bulls can fiercely defend the $0.50 support level, more gains could be expected soon. But the bulls will regain full control on a break and close above $0.58.

All signs pointed to this: the fight against inflation appeared to be coming to an end, jobs data promised a cooling labor market on the horizon, and consumer confidence began to falter. Fast forward to May’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and the hopes of a rate cut in the first half of 2024 are quickly diminishing. Indeed, it appears likely the Fed will hold rates where they are for much longer than anyone could have imagined back in January. Some market commentators even think we're stuck with “higher for longer” until 2025, despite the pressure of an imminent presidential election. Whether rates stay put until September or next January, the May FOMC meeting was certainly a far cry from December 2023, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell first mentioned rate cuts, sending markets into a frenzy. Now, we're seeing a much more hawkish committee, resolute in its restrictive monetary policy stance in the face of stubborn inflation and a labor market that refuses to stumble.Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingBut while disappointing for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, the Fed's stance shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who follows economic data. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the PCE index — rose to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in February. The CPI index has remained similarly sticky, rising again from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March. This has been fuelled by rampant spending, with consumers preferring to take on more debt rather than tighten their belts. In fact, the savings rate in the U.S. has continuously declined from 4.1% in January to just 3.2% in March, while household debt levels keep beating previous records. On top of this, unemployment has failed to edge higher. The jobless rate fell from 3.9% in February to 3.8% in March, hovering around historic lows. Jerome Powell is refusing to say when the Fed might start cutting rates. Source: XSo, even though the economy is beginning to slow — first-quarter GDP growth surprised on the downside, coming in at 1.6% against expectations of 2.4% - we're still a long way from the economic slowdown that would warrant stimulus in the form of rate cuts. Indeed, Powell has always been clear that the Fed's monetary policy decisions will be driven by data, and data alone. And the data simply doesn't support a looser stance, yet. As expected, the markets have been taking this disappointment badly. Bitcoin (BTC) was hovered between $60,000 and $65,000 in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting, and global stock markets were subdued as expectations of a hawkish pivot mounted. Conversely, the dollar strengthened, battering other global currencies like the yen, which fell to the lowest level against the dollar since 1990. Other emerging market currencies can be expected to follow. Jerome Powell said it was "unlikely" the Fed's next move would be a rate hike. Source: XAnd the bad news is that we're likely stuck with this picture for a good few months. This will be a real anticlimax for those who expected the Bitcoin halving to drive a bullish breakout to a new all-time high. After some rampant price action over recent months, no one is ready for another extended period of sideways trading. It’s akin to the lights going on at the nightclub when the party is just getting started.Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsAs long as the Fed holds rates steady, though, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a tight range — below $70,000 — barring any major global disasters causing a flight to safety. So far this year, Bitcoin hasn’t really cared about macroeconomics — it shrugged off the last few inflation announcements. But the Fed’s stance will have a more profound effect. The reality is that BTC is now deeply embedded in traditional financial markets thanks to spot ETFs, so it will most likely mimic the behavior of other risk assets until rates begin coming down. So, thanks to Jerome Powell, we’re in for a boring summer that will truly test investors’ patience. That's not to say there won't be another Bitcoin party — it's coming, and it will likely rival or perhaps even surpass what we've already seen this year. Over the longer term, the Bitcoin investment thesis remains intact. Indeed, while Powell's renewed hawkishness is buoying the U.S. dollar for now, it's only a matter of time until the Fed finally pulls the plug, causing renewed dollar weakness. Once the greenback begins its slide, Bitcoin will provide refuge from currency devaluation. Then, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs will truly come into their own, and those who can hold on to their assets and wait out the drought will be rewarded. Until then, perhaps it's not such a bad idea to leave investment portfolios alone and go enjoy the summer.

Tether reports a Q1 net profit of $4.52 billion.



Gains come from treasury holdings and Bitcoin and Gold.



Treasuries enable Tether to make substantial profits. 
Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of USDT, the biggest stablecoin in the world, had often found itself in controversy. These largely stemmed from the transparency of its reserves, which often came under question. Since then, Tether has started to take transparency more seriously. Its latest report breaks down the company’s assets, including its significant profits. Where do Tether’s Profits Come From? On Wednesday, May 1, Tether Holdings Limited released its financial report for the first quarter of 2024, showing a record net profit of $4.52 billion. According to the attestation by the accounting firm BDO, the largest share, $1 billion, came from US Treasuries. 
The remainder came from the increase in the value of Bitcoin and gold, which Tether owns in large quantities. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price was $42,280 and has since shot up significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $57,329. Moreover, gold has significantly increased over the same period, going from $2070 per ounce to $2300. Source: TetherTether’s considerable Bitcoin and gold holdings contributed substantially to its profits. According to the attestation, Tether’s total reserves are $115.41 billion, with the largest portion, $90.87 billion, in U.S. Treasuries. Why Tether Holds So Much BondsTether’s bonds offer a liquid asset that is easily convertible to cash, enabling the company to meet eventual withdrawal demands. However, unlike cash reserves, US Treasury bonds provide a return on investment. This means Tether can profitably from them while exposing itself to relatively little risk.  
In addition to bonds, Tether holds $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents. These are highly liquid assets that fulfill immediate redemption requirements. In addition to treasury bonds and cash, Tether also holds $5.37 billion in Bitcoin and $3.65 billion in Gold. Notably, Tether issues a gold-backed stablecoin, which explains its substantial gold holdings. On the Flipside
Despite Tether’s reports, questions about its reserve transparency still persist among the crypto community. 



Tether has recently been expanding beyond stablecoins, including into venture capital, big data, and AI. 
Why This MattersTether’s recent financial outcomes and the management of its reserves have broad implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting perceptions of USDT’s stability and reliability.Read more about Tether’s controversies: Tether (USDT): A Giant With Feet of Clay?Read more about Solana’s latest performance: Solana Sees Momentum Dwindle as Updates Fail to Fix Congestion

According to a report by Reuters, Judge Juan Merchan has fined former U.S. President Donald Trump $9,000 for contempt of court during his ongoing criminal hush money trial, warning that incarceration could follow if Trump continues to breach the gag order. The fine, issued on Tuesday, was for Trump’s violation of the gag order, which restricts him from making public comments about trial witnesses and participants. Trump was penalized $1,000 for each of nine comments he made online that the judge found in violation of this order.



Justice Merchan, overseeing the trial, expressed concerns that the fine might not sufficiently deter Trump, given his substantial wealth, and noted his own limitations in imposing a higher penalty. The judge emphasized the necessity of upholding the integrity of the court’s orders and indicated a willingness to consider jail as a further measure if Trump persists in his violations.



The cited comments included an article shared by Trump labeling his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness in the trial, as a “serial liar.” Another contentious post cited a claim about “undercover liberal activists” attempting to infiltrate the jury. Merchan dismissed Trump’s defense that he should not be held accountable for content he reposted but did not originally write.



A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Thursday, where additional penalties for other statements may be discussed. Merchan also demanded the removal of the offending posts from Trump’s Truth Social platform and his campaign website.



In a response on Truth Social, Trump decried the actions as an infringement on his free speech and denounced the trial as “rigged.” His attorney, Todd Blanche, argued the posts were legitimate responses to political attacks, yet failed to provide evidence of any provocation by the witnesses involved.



The developments occur amid Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting his charges of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment meant to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter. Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty.



According to a report by The New York Times (NYT), the $9,000 gag order violation fine prompted late-night comedians to seize the opportunity for some lighthearted jabs at Trump’s expense.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” playfully questioned the significance of the $9,000 fine for a successful businessman like Trump:



“I know $9,000 might not seem like a lot to a successful businessman, but what about to Trump?”



 However, he quickly followed up with a more serious note, mentioning that the judge lamented the legal limit on the fine and warned that if Trump continues to violate the gag order, jail time may become a necessary punishment. Colbert quipped, “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump, but I need it.”



On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the host took a different approach, arguing that the situation seemed unfair to Trump. Kimmel pointed out the irony of the trial being about Trump paying a woman to be quiet, only to now face fines for not being quiet himself. He jokingly compared the situation to Jesus, a carpenter, being nailed to a cross, and urged his audience to “think about it” and “read about it in your Trump-brand Bibles.”



Kimmel also poked fun at the judge’s warning that continued gag order violations could result in Trump being locked up. He imagined Trump’s wife, Melania, encouraging her husband not to let the judge dictate his actions.



The comedians didn’t stop there. Kimmel took a jab at Trump’s spending habits, suggesting that the former president could easily spend $9,000 at a Wendy’s drive-through. Jimmy Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show,” joined in, imagining Trump’s response to the fine: “But I get the 10th one free, right?”

With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols. This enables users on the Bitcoin network to earn additional staking rewards while providing other ecosystems access to Bitcoin liquidity.”To engage in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), users first delegate their BTC to an operator in a restaking protocol, which is then used as collateral for Ankr to create BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In the case of Talus, the Bitcoin LSTs can be used to power the blockchain’s smart agents or AI assistants and their applications, such as “booking travel, making purchases online, and managing portfolios.”Smart agents on Talus are also capable of bundling multilayer atomic swaps and executing them in one single transaction to provide security exploits such as flash loan attacks. “Ankr’s BTC liquid staking unlocks a massive amount of liquidity to ensure that smart agents on Talus can execute simultaneous DeFi transactions like atomic swaps seamlessly,” Talus commented. The move comes after Ankr revealed its first Bitcoin liquid staking product in early March in conjunction with the Babylon protocol. The project allows users to “earn yields from their idle bitcoins in a secure way” by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral to mint LSTs that can be used to validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains. Yields earned from the staked LSTs are then funneled back to users’ locked Bitcoin. Currently, the Babylon protocol is in its testnet phase, with a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year. Despite an ongoing market correction, the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem has been thriving over the past year with the invention of new protocols such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Atomicals and Runes. One such project, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, has accumulated a total value locked of $700 million from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin and BNB Smart Chain. In a statement to Cointelegraph, SolvBTC claimed that the protocol recently surpassed 10,000 BTC staked and attracted “over 92,000 participants” shortly after its launch earlier this month. Related: Bitcoin ecosystem reinvigorated by memecoins, new protocols

&amp;nbsp
Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its dog-themed branding, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in whale activity, indicating significant movements of large SHIB tokens. This surge comes after SHIB’s price decline of over 10% over the last seven days.



Whale activity, often a key indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, saw a staggering 268% increase in the case of Shiba Inu. Large transaction volume, typically involving transactions worth more than $100,000, surged to $98.12 million within 24 hours.



This surge highlights a significant uptick in whale activity, suggesting that large holders of SHIB tokens are actively buying or selling.



Dramatic Increase in SHIB Large Transactions



According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions in Shiba Inu saw a dramatic increase from 1.07 trillion SHIB on April 28 to 4.17 trillion SHIB on April 29. This substantial spike in large transactions indicates that whales in the SHIB market have been particularly active, possibly taking advantage of the price dip.



SHIB has still been down by 12.05% over the past seven days. This divergence between whale activity and price performance suggests a complex interplay of factors driving SHIB’s market dynamics.

Shiba Inu Ecosystem Key Developments



In other developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, the Shiba Eternity collectible card game (CCG) has undergone significant upgrades. The latest version, 1.2.7, introduces enhancements to improve player interaction and strategic depth.



Notable changes include improvements to the social menu, making players connect easier, and adjustments to fighter mechanics, providing a more balanced gameplay experience. Specifically, these fighters have been tweaked to no longer inflict debuff damage on adjacent friendly fighters upon being destroyed.



ShibaSwap, the project’s decentralized exchange (DEX), is expanding to support Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. This move enhances security and interoperability, offering users a seamless trading experience.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting by keeping interest rates unchanged, maintaining the target range at 5.25% to 5.5%. This decision was widely anticipated by market participants and came as a relief to investors, who had been closely monitoring the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.



According to a report by CNBC, during the post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided insights into the Fed’s decision-making process and its outlook for the future. Powell emphasized that the central bank’s rate decisions are not influenced by political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He stressed the importance of focusing on getting the economics right and stated that considering political factors would reduce the likelihood of achieving that goal.



Powell also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction process, known as quantitative tightening (QT). He clarified that the decision to slow the pace of reducing the balance sheet is not intended to provide accommodation to the economy or be less restrictive. Instead, the move aims to ensure a smooth process and avoid financial market turmoil, drawing lessons from the previous instance of balance sheet reduction.



When asked about the possibility of the U.S. entering a period of “stagflation,” characterized by slowing economic growth and persistent inflation, Powell downplayed these concerns. He pointed out that, by some measures, economic growth is at 3%, and inflation is below 3%, suggesting that the current economic environment does not fit the definition of stagflation.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Powell’s remarks was his indication that it is unlikely the next policy move will be a rate hike. This statement prompted a rally in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all initially experiencing sharp gains. Powell’s comments provided reassurance to investors who had been anticipating a potential pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle.



Powell also acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has not yet gained “greater confidence” in the trajectory of inflation this year. He stated that the central bank is prepared to maintain the current target federal funds rate for as long as necessary until there is persuasive evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% target.



While the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, the central bank’s cautious tone and willingness to remain patient in the face of uncertain economic conditions have provided some comfort to market participants. As investors digest the implications of the Fed’s latest meeting, attention will now turn to upcoming economic data releases, particularly those related to the labor market and inflation, which will help shape expectations for future monetary policy decisions.

At the time of writing (8:48 p.m. UTC on May 1), Bitcoin is trading at $57,313, down 4.6% in the past 24-hour period.







Macroeconomist Alex Krüger had this to say about the crypto market’s reaction to Fed Chair Powell’s comments:

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), XRP as well as several other altcoins turned green during a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before giving up some of their gains. Powell dismissed market concerns about "stagflation," a scenario in which slow economic growth is coupled with high inflation. He said that he did not see "the stag or the flation."Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon amplified stagflation concerns, warning that the US economy might be heading back to the 1970s. In response to Powell's speech, American businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach said that he expects only a single rate cut this year. He doesn't see a rate cut coming this June. The Fed chair himself has stated that it would be hard to predict how the rates are going to change, but he has predicted that the next policy move is unlikely to be a cut. According to Powell, rate cuts could come sooner due to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. However, the decision will still hinge on the incoming inflation data. Powell has stressed that the Fed is now satisfied with inflation staying at 3%. The Fed's goal is to bring inflation back to 2% before it would be able to start cutting rates. Interest rate futures are betting on a single rate cut in 2024. The first rate cut is expected to occur in September. The cryptocurrency market has been hit hard by the Fed's U-turn, with Bitcoin logging its worst monthly candle since August 2023. The Fed was previously predicted to implement at least three rate cuts this year.

Bitcoin’s price briefly soared to $59,300 following a selloff that dipped it below $56,700 earlier today, according to CoinGecko’s data. The resurgence came after the Federal Reserve (Fed) had decided to maintain interest rates between 525 and 550 basis points.In a statement announcing the hold, Powell said the decision to hold rates steady was due to high inflation. As he noted, the Fed plans to continue reducing public bond sales, yet the remaining bonds continue to be sold at the same pace.“Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace,” stated Powell, “…in recent months inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.”Powell noted the solid pace of economic expansion, strong job gains, and low unemployment, despite inflation remaining above the desired 2 percent target.“Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” he said. “Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.”According to him, inflation has exceeded expectations in the short term, yet aligns with long-term forecasts. Due to these higher-than-anticipated inflation indicators, the central bank remains hesitant to lower interest rates.The Fed has indicated that it will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. However, it also noted that it would consider adjusting its policy should there be an increase in unemployment.Fed Chair: “I don’t see the stag or the flation”In contrast to the previous belief that Powell could have a hawkish stance, he maintained a neutral stance during his speech today.Addressing a series of questions from the media about the state of the world’s economic powerhouse, Powell said there is a low likelihood of raising interest rates further, as current data does not support such a move. According to him, the Fed believes that the current high-interest rates are sufficient to guide inflation back toward the 2% target.Speaking of stagflation risks, he expressed skepticism about the claim that the US has entered a period of stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation coupled with economic decline.According to Powell, the defining conditions of stagflation won’t last or fully develop because inflation will eventually decrease.“I don’t see the ‘stag’ or the ‘-flation’,” Powell said. “I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he added.Despite Powell’s neutral stance, Bitcoin’s regained momentum faltered. After briefly surpassing $59,000, it couldn’t hold above this key level. CoinGecko data shows Bitcoin is currently trading at around $57,300, a 3.4% drop in one hour.Similarly, top ten altcoins experienced a modest post-Fed decision rally, with gains between 0.5% and 2.5%. However, this short-lived bounce quickly fizzled out.

Bitcoin layer-2 project Stacks (STX) has announced a significant delay in the activation of the much-anticipated Nakamoto update. The delay was due to the need for an additional eight weeks of development time.
Mitchell Cuevas, who heads the Stacks Open Internet Foundation, detailed the reasons behind the delay in a recent blog post. Cuevas explained that, armed with more knowledge and practical experience with the features of the new network, the core developers determined that they needed a more advanced Signer resiliency/recovery system. This was something originally planned for a later release.



As a result, they anticipate an additional eight weeks of development and testing time before the second hard fork, which will bring Nakamoto features to us in 'Activation'. The new Signer flexibility features are expected to be completed by July 15, with Activation to begin on August 28.
Cuevas acknowledged his disappointment that the dates were changed so late. He wrote: “Fast blocks can't get here fast enough. However, this change is being made to ensure the security and liveness of the network upgrade.”





STX has lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last month.

BONK Inu’s market cap rises to $1.40 billion, surpassing Floki Inu.
Despite overall memecoin market downturn, BONK gains nearly 50% in two weeks. 

As the broader crypto market continues to navigate turbulent waters with an overall downturn, the memecoin sector is not immune to the volatility, experiencing a significant drop of 13.3% in 24 hours. 
This decline has reduced the total market cap of meme coins to approximately $45.2 billion. Amid this general market retreat, a notable exception emerges—Bonk [BONK].
BONK becomes the fifth-largest memecoin
While the majority of meme coins have faced downward pressure, Bonk has charted a different course.
 Over the past two weeks, BONK has surged nearly 50%, contrasting sharply with the modest 3% gain of its peer, Floki Inu [FLOKI], according to recent data from CoinGecko. 
This growth has propelled BONK’s market valuation to $1.40 billion, enabling it to leapfrog over Floki Inu and secure its position as the fifth-largest memecoin in the market. 
As a result, BONK now stands as the 58th largest cryptocurrency globally, surpassing well-known names such as Aave [AAVE] and Algorand [ALGO].
Emerging on the cryptocurrency scene in December 2022, Bonk initially flew under the radar until it caught the market’s attention a year later with a dramatic price increase. 
This surge was fueled by robust investor interest, endorsements from influential figures within the crypto community, and its inclusion on several major cryptocurrency exchange platforms. 
Notably, BONK also ranks as the second-largest memecoin on the Solana [SOL] blockchain, trailing only Dogwifhat [WIF]. 
The latter experienced a significant market cap increase to nearly $5 billion at the end of March as well, before retracting to around $2.2 billion.
BONK: Market outlook
Despite the recent success of Bonk in overtaking its competition, technical analysis of both BONK and Floki Inu revealed potential challenges ahead.

Realistic or not, here’s BONK market cap in BTC’s terms

The daily chart for BONK indicated a bearish pattern, with the memecoin’s price recently triggering a liquidity pull on the buy side, suggesting a possible downturn as it targets the next swing low.

Floki Inu’s 8-hour chart mirrored this sentiment, indicating potential declines for both meme coins in the near future.

                            Stablecoin issuer Tether, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market behind the widely used USDT stablecoin, has released its audit statement for the first quarter of 2024, accompanied by a report conducted by independent accounting firm BDO. 
The report, which provides additional financial information beyond the reserves backing Tether’s fiat-denominated stablecoins, shows the company’s profit for the first quarter of the year, which saw an increased influx of capital into the market. 
Tether Q1 2024 Financials Soar
Digging into the numbers, the first quarter of 2024 proved highly profitable for Tether, with a net profit of $4.52 billion. 
The main contributors, the entities responsible for issuing stablecoins and managing reserves, reportedly generated approximately $1 billion of this profit from net operating gains, primarily from US Treasury holdings. The remaining profits were attributable to mark-to-market gains on Bitcoin (BTC) and gold positions.

The report also highlighted Tether’s success in increasing its direct and indirect holdings of US Treasuries to over $90 billion. This includes indirect exposure through overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries and investments in US Treasuries through money market funds.

In a sign of significant growth, Tether also disclosed its net equity for the first time, revealing a figure of $11.37 billion as of March 31, 2024. This is an increase from the $7.01 billion equity reported as of December 31, 2023. 
The report also highlighted a $1 billion increase in excess reserves, which support the company’s stablecoin offerings, bringing the total to nearly $6.3 billion.
CEO Emphasizes Transparency And Stability
The BDO confirmation reiterated that Tether-issued tokens are 90% backed by cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the company’s stance on maintaining liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the report revealed that over $12.5 billion worth of USDT was issued in the first quarter alone.
Tether Group’s strategic investments, which exceed $5 billion as of the report date, span various sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data, renewable energy, person-to-person (P2P) communication, and Bitcoin Mining. 

In response to the latest report, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed the company’s commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. 
Ardoino highlighted Tether’s record-breaking profit benchmark of $4.52 billion and the company’s efforts to increase transparency and trust within the cryptocurrency industry. Ardoino further claimed:

In reporting not just the composition of our reserves, but now the Group’s net equity of $11.37 billion, Tether is again raising the bar in the cryptocurrency industry in the realms of transparency and trust.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?Optimism among market participants is fading—and now that the SEC’s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.“If this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt. That’s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security—and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)To be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant’s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency’s position on ETH.While the long-term impact of SEC’s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren’t happening—at least, not without another legal fight.Spot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January—but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.Still, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren’t so sure.Ethereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week’s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC’s now-evident position on ETH’s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren’t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that’s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said. It doesn’t appear, though, that the SEC’s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers—at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved. Van Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well. The company’s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved “in time.” But he emphasized that Van Eck’s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week’s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.“This has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,” he said. “Part of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:32 </pubDate></item><item><title>Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge aims for Q3 2024 launch</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-bitcoin-cross-chain-bridge-q3-2024</link><description>Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge Zeus Network will launch its Zeus Program Library (ZPL) that connects the two ecosystems by Q3 2024. “These ZPL-Assets unlock a world of opportunities on Solana,” Zues Network wrote on May 1. “Facilitating activities like DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, DePIN, and more, which were previously challenging on the Bitcoin blockchain.”ZPL is a set of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) programs that enables developers to integrate native Solana support into decentralized applications and power transactions across multiple blockchains. “ZPL-Assets can be either fungible (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (NFTs), representing a wide range of digital assets,” commented Zeus Network, continuing: “With a market cap of approximately 1.2 trillion dollars, and over 11,000 Runes generating over $135 million in fees within the first week on the Bitcoin blockchain, the potential for value transfer is immense.”Through ZPL and bridging protocol Apollo, users deposit their Bitcoin (BTC) and, in return, receive ZPL-wrapped zBTC tokens, which can then be used to engage with decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, borrowing, lending, gaming and SocialFi within the Solana ecosystem. Developers plan to further expand ZPL-supported assets on Solana to Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals, dubbed “zRuneX” and “zOrdX,” respectively. Other tasks in its Q3 roadmap include enabling Bitcoin staking on its Apollo mainnet. Zeus Network is backed by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali. On April 8, the protocol secured a $8 million funding round at a valuation of $100 million. Released in April, Bitcoin Runes is a new token standard that expands the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling users to tokenize various real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking transfer, and minting of unique assets on the namesake blockchain. The Bitcoin decentralized application ecosystem has been experiencing a revival with the invention of such novel protocols. Last month, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables BRC-20 token swaps. Related: BONK, POPCAT and Solana memecoins stay green even as Bitcoin price drops

Instead, the Ethereum sidechain gaming network instead opts for a closed, curated approach at present.There’s a reason for this kind of early approach, the team says—and it's hard to argue with success, given the vast rise in Ronin players in recent months, plus its surge to an all-time high price in March ahead of the recent markets cooldown.And there's a path to a “pervasively permissionless” Ronin network ahead.“There are too many developers, too many applications, and too many games,” Sky Mavis and Ronin co-founder Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin told Decrypt. “There are more applications, games, and developers than there are actual real people using these applications.”Many open blockchains have an “overabundance” of games, Zirlin believes, while the relatively small number of gamers that are playing in this space struggle to sift through the good and the bad. To battle this dilemma, Ronin curates the games that are allowed on its network.In his personal time—and aside from crypto games—Zirlin only plays games by Nintendo, Blizzard, and Supercell. They’re giants of the industry known for releasing few games, and often really beloved and massively popular games at that.Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin. Image: Jeff ZirlinBy curating Ronin’s game library, he believes that the network is aligning itself with these game publishers. In fact, he suggests that the Web3 element “adds another layer on top” by incentivizing gamers to support the network through its token.“This strategy emphasizes quality over quantity, allowing us to work closely with fewer teams and ensure their long-term success in the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming,” Zirlin explained. “[A Twitter poll] showed us that 40% of all [Axie] gamers were onboarded by a friend or family member. So these are insane levels of evangelism.”In turn, Ronin accounts for 30% of all active Web3 gamers, the largest share by some margin with Polygon in second at 17%, according to Footprint Analytics. Despite the model working for Ronin, most of Web3 opts against such an approach.“In order to win, you need to do non-consensus things. That’s where most of the strategic leverage is,” Zirlin explained. “People want chaos, I guess, in Web3. But for the adoption of a new technology, you need to be more zen. You don't want to confuse people, because the technology is already confusing enough.”Thus far, a curated approach appears to have served Ronin well. The doors will only be closed for so long, however, as Zirlin admits that open models do have advantages in the long run—and Ronin is indeed eyeing up a more open future.Looking down the path, one major hurdle in Ronin’s way is scalability. Currently, Ronin claims, the network can handle 7.5 million daily transactions without congestion. This may not be enough once the network is opened to all builders, so Sky Mavis is actively exploring scaling solutions to increase what Ronin can handle. But scaling isn’t just a technical leap, said Zirlin—it’s also a cultural challenge.“Ultimately, the key factor in scalability is not just technical superiority, but also user adoption and loyalty,” Zirlin explained. “Similar to the console wars of the past, where players chose platforms based on where their friends were, our focus is on curating games that draw players to Ronin.”Once Ronin turns “pervasively permissionless,” Zirlin said, he expects the number of games deploying on Ronin to accelerate. He hopes one of these games will help drive growth for the network, as current game Pixels is doing at present and Axie Infinity did back during the play-to-earn boom in 2021—but this time without such a heavy-handed approach from Ronin.When Ronin plans open up the network is still undecided. Once this path ends and Ronin opens its doors, the network will begin to eye up its next big transformation—expanding beyond gaming.“The endgame is to create an ecosystem that seamlessly blends gaming with ecommerce and payment apps,” Zirlin told Decrypt.  "We believe the path to getting there is by bootstrapping adoption and attention through gaming, and then expanding into payments and ecommerce, thereby disrupting the predatory banking system and credit card industry.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:33 </pubDate></item><item><title>MANEKI and POPCAT soar by two digits while Bitcoin stumbles - Crypto Briefing</title><link>https://cryptobriefing.com/solana-meme-coin-gains/</link><description>

Earlier today, in an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Laxman Narasimhan provided a candid look at the company’s disappointing fiscal Q2 2024 results. Yesterday, Starbucks issued a detailed press release shedding light on the complexities and strategic adjustments the company is navigating through these challenging times.



Starbucks reported a 2% decline in consolidated net revenues, amounting to $8.6 billion, which the company attributes to a complex operating environment. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at $0.68, marking a significant decrease from the previous year, with GAAP earnings per share down by 14% and Non-GAAP earnings per share down by 8%.



Key performance highlights from the fiscal second quarter include:



Global Comparable Store Sales: There was a 4% decline overall, driven by a sharp 6% decrease in transactions but partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket prices.North American Performance: Comparable store sales in North America fell by 3%, with transactions down 7%, though mitigated slightly by a 4% rise in average ticket prices.International Markets: International comparable store sales saw a 6% decrease, with an 11% decline in China due to significant drops in both ticket prices and transaction volumes.



The company also continued its expansion, opening 364 net new stores globally, bringing the total count to 38,951 stores, split between company-operated and licensed outlets.



The operating margin showed a contraction, with GAAP operating margins decreasing by 240 basis points to 12.8%. This was primarily due to increased investments in store partner wages, benefits, and promotional activities. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is committed to its long-term strategy and is actively implementing the “Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps” strategy, aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring future growth.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program reported an increase in 90-day active members in the U.S. to 32.8 million, up by 6% from the previous year. This highlights a resilient aspect of Starbucks’ customer engagement strategy despite broader market challenges.



The Starbucks CEO remarked on the quarter’s performance, “In a highly challenged environment, this quarter’s results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead.” He emphasized the comprehensive roadmap and action plans the company has laid out to navigate through the current complexities.



CFO Rachel Ruggeri also commented on the financial discipline and strategic focus, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to capital allocation and operational efficiencies as they steer through dynamic market conditions.



The Starbucks share price closed at $74.44, down 15.88% on the day.

Which Project's Airdrops Were Targeted? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi</title><link>https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/chinese-police-reveals-airdrop-scam-which-projects-airdrops-were-targeted-here-are-the-details/</link><description>
Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.
Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.


The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.
The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.





This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.


The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.
This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.





Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.
They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

Macro Mania. Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have gotten bullish on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.
BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.
In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after inventory levels exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, decreasing the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.
Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:



Optimism (OP) – 541
Hedera (HBAR) – 459
Cardano (ADA) – 432
Chainlink (LINK) – 397
Polkadot (DOT) – 390
Ethereum (ETH) – 323
Cosmos (ATOM) – 301
Internet Computer (ICP) – 295
MultiversX (EGLD) – 247
Aptos (APT) – 228


It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.
This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune dashboard. That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.Daily LST WithdrawalsThe project is facing severe backlash from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows. 
With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.
The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 
This indicator is vital for SHIB’s short-term trajectory, serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.

Conversely, SHIB has some potential bullish signals on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move. 

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025. 
Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.
As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.

								Market intelligence platform Kaiko Analytics reports that new competitors are chipping away at Tether’s (USDT) stablecoin dominance.
In a new report titled “Tether Loses Market Share,” Kaiko Analytics says that the stablecoin issuer’s market share over centralized exchange platforms (CEXs) has dipped 13% year-to-date (YTD) due to the growth of rival dollar-pegged digital assets, such as FDUSD and USDC.










“Despite its dominant market position, USDT’s market share on CEXs has been trending downwards, declining from 82% to 69% YTD. This decrease can be partly attributed to growing competition from stablecoins like FDUSD which benefit from Binance’s zero-fee promotions.
 USDC has also experienced a rise in its market share, signaling a growing preference for regulated alternatives. At present, stablecoins issued in the US make up 10% of the overall stablecoin trade volume.
 Only one of the top five stablecoins by market cap, Circle’s USDC, is regulated under state US money transmitter frameworks. Nevertheless, its share has increased from less than 1% in 2020 to 11% today.” According to Kaiko, other rivals such as Ethena (USDe), which uniquely offers yield, could also be cutting into Tether’s market dominance.
“Another reason for Tether’s declining market share could be linked to the emergence of innovative yield-bearing alternatives such as Ethena’s USDe. Since its launch in February, USDe’s volume has grown significantly, although it has retreated from April’s all-time high of more than $800 million following Ethena’s ENA airdrop.”
According to Tether’s 2024 Attestation Report, the firm posted a record-breaking $4.52 billion in profits during the first quarter of the year.

                            As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time.
However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here?
In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to plunge from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering.
This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull examined some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in.
According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom.
In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the flagship cryptocurrency might “wick through the support and bounce back.”

According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023.
Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top.
Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle
According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the post, today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023.
The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think.


Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the resemblances include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.”
After today’s retrace, the analyst added the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.”
Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.”
As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

BNB tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period owing to broader market bloodbath.
The positive commentary around the coin increased dramatically in the last 24–48 hours.

Binance Coin [BNB] suffered substantial losses in the last 24 hours, as the broader market downturn took its toll on the native token of the Binance ecosystem.
The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period, data from CoinMarketCap showed.
However, on a monthly time frame, the coin performed comparatively better against other leading coins, nursing losses of just 6%.
That being said, BNB could be in for healthy gains in the short to medium term, as a major chapter, which fueled considerable FUD for the coin in the recent past, reached a conclusion.
A short-term bullish catalyst?
Binance’s ex-boss, Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, was sentenced to four months in prison, for the charges brought against him by the U.S. government.
The charges were severe, including violation of anti-money-laundering rules that allowed illicit transactions on the exchange.
The news of the announcement set the social circles buzzing. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the mention of BNB on top crypto-focused social channels surged dramatically.
Interestingly, positive commentary around the coin exceeded bearish takes, as weighted sentiment entered the positive territory. This suggested a more favorable view of BNB’s next moves by the market.

Futures traders not hopeful of quick rebound
BNB’s sentiment in the derivatives market continued to be bearish.

The Open Interest (OI), or the money invested in active futures contracts of BNB, dropped 1.27% in the last 24 hours to $564 million.
While this might be due to the broader market downturn, BNB could see investments trickling in once the sentiment improves.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is known for her bold predictions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Despite the skepticism surrounding these predictions, they continue to attract the attention of investors and analysts alike.
At an investor day in New York, Wood made a surprising prediction. According to Wood, Bitcoin price could rise to a staggering $3.8 million by 2030.


In his own words, Wood expressed his prediction as follows:

“Last year, we put forward our bullish scenario for Bitcoin. This figure was $1.5 million. With the institutional green light provided by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), albeit difficult, according to our analysis, institutional investors invested a little more than 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. “If they do, and we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the estimate I gave you.”


Wood's prediction is based on the assumption that institutional investors will start investing heavily in Bitcoin. If Wood's prediction proves correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million by 2030, a modest investment of $1,000 today could potentially rise to over $60,000. However, there are also many analysts who are skeptical of Wood's prediction, considering it only has 5.5 years to come true.

								Despite the current market downtrend, crypto traders are still finding ways to make life-changing gains. This is the case of some Solana meme coin traders who recently turned $6,400 into $8 million in 24 hours. 
How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a meme coin on Solana. 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.

These wallets then transferred their $TIM holdings (now worth around $8.28 million) to multiple addresses to avoid drawing attention. On-chain data shows that they are already looking to secure their profits, as they have been selling their $TIM tokens, although in small bits, to avoid a market crash.

Meme coins (especially ones on Solana) have continued to provide traders with significant gains, especially with Bitcoin and other major cap cryptocurrencies maintaining a downward trend. Bitcoinist previously reported of a trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million with Dogwifhat (WIF) by getting in early on the meme coin while it was still a micro-cap token. 
Meanwhile, more recently, pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier was reported to have turned $353 into $8.3 million by investing in $KEYCAT, a meme coin on Base. The layer-2 network (like Solana) has witnessed an influx of meme coin traders thanks to the barrage of meme coins that continue to launch on the network daily.  
More Recent Success Stories
Lookonchain also recently revealed a trader who turned $9,770 into $10 million in just a day. The trader spent 64.5 SOL to buy 97.36 million $GUMMY (another Solana-based meme coin) in the “same block where the $GUMMY deployer added liquidity.” Another trader turned $110,000 into 48.72 million in just 3 hours by buying $MANEKI.

Although this trader wasn’t the first to buy the meme coin, he used $716 SOL to acquire 1.02 billion $MANEKI (11.51% of the token’s supply) less than one minute after the token launched. Like the $TIM traders, he distributed these $MANEKI tokens across different wallets to avoid drawing attention. 
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there is an ugly side to meme coin trading, as some traders have also recorded significant losses. One is a trader who recently spent 1,600 SOL to buy $COOL and ended up selling the meme coin for 532.58 SOL, losing 1,067.42 ($152,000) in the process.

The division explained in a statement:“Due to the nature of the felonies committed by [former Binance CEO Changpeng] Zhao, the Division has revoked Binance.US's money transmission license.”Oregon was following the example of five states that moved against the exchange after Zhao pleaded guilty to violating Anti-Money Laundering laws. Florida was the first state to act, suspending Binance.US’ license in November, shortly after Zhao’s guilty plea. Alaska followed suit at the beginning of January when it declined to renew its license.Related: Former NY Fed chief joins Binance.US boardNorth Carolina suspended Binance.US’ license on January 23, and Maine declined to renew its license on January 29. According to a local press report, Connecticut suspended Binance.US’ license on April 24.

Binance.US chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett said in a court deposition in December that the exchange had taken a “near-mortal blow,” forcing it to lay off over 200 staff members, due to U.S. banks’ unwillingness to work with it.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance in June. In that suit, the SEC claimed that Binance.US had failed to register as an exchange, broker and clearing agency. It further alleged that Binance.US lacked controls over “manipulative trading,” engaged in wash trading and had commingled funds with Binance, which created Binance.US in 2019 under regulatory pressure.Magazine: US and China try to crush Binance, SBF’s $40M bribe claim: Asia Express

On-chain data shows that a slowdown in Bitcoin demand growth and increased open short positions may be responsible for the latest drawdown, and it’s possible that new lows will be in store for BTC.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewReporting from CryptoQuant attributes BTC’s latest decline to a slowdown in demand characterized by decreased growth in Bitcoin balances among permanent holders, slowing spot Bitcoin ETF demand and an increase in short positions in the futures market.CryptoQuant data shows that demand from permanent holders (investors who only purchase Bitcoin and never sell) fell by 50% in April, from over 200,000 BTC in late March to about 90,000 BTC. “Accelerating demand growth is needed for prices to bottom and eventually rally significantly.”Bitcoin demand from accumulated addresses. Source: CryptoQuantThe chart above reveals that this metric has “reached levels similar to early March when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,” dropping 7% immediately after breaching its all-time highs. Demand from whales has been declining since late March,, and according to CryptoQuant analysts, BTC price corrections are usually driven by slower growth in demand from large investors.“Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”Monthly change in total Bitcoin whale holdings. Source: CryptoQuantThe analysts also said that the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was evinced by declining purchases from spot ETFs in the U.S., which also added to the sell-side pressure.“The daily purchase of Bitcoin from ETFs has plummeted to basically zero currently, after peaking in mid-March at more than $1 billion,” noted the report, adding that "a new wave of Bitcoin purchases from ETFs is needed to refresh demand growth.”Another metric that the on-chain data analytics firm used to explain the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was the “traders’ unwillingness to pay more to open long positions” as sell orders outpace buy orders. Bitcoin funding rates. Source: CryptoQuantBitcoin’s funding rate has dropped to a year-to-date low, indicating traders’ unwillingness to “pay as much as before to open long positions.”Instead, “the recent price decline has been caused by traders opening short positions, expecting prices to decline further,” the report noted.Analysts agree that downside is the likely direction for Bitcoin priceThe ongoing market correction has left market participants wondering how low Bitcoin price can go before a trend reversal occurs. CryptoQuant analysts set the lower target within the $55,000 to $57,000 demand zone, which is “10% below the current cost basis of traders of $63,000.” Traders’ cost basis has been known to offer support for prices during bull markets.“The current Bitcoin price is already below traders’ cost basis.”Bitcoin STH realized profit/loss. Source: CryptoQuantFor popular analyst Scott Melker, $52,000 is as low as the BTC price can go in the short term. Melker said the correction is still mild for a bull market since the daily RSI is not yet oversold.“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”Continuing, Tuur Demeester, a Bitcoin analyst, spotted BTC trading at $60,409, saying $50,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin now that the $60,000 support was lost. Source: Tuur DemeesterTrader and analyst Mags said that if Bitcoin closes below $60,000 on the weekly timeframe, traders should “expect a much deeper retracement, till $40,000 and even lower.”“In this cycle so far, we have seen 4 pullbacks between 20-22%. If we witness something similar, a -22% correction from the local high would put us at $58,000 - $57,500.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Coinbase to report first-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.The company reported revenue of $772.53 million in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in five straight quarters.Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.00 for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 34 cents in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last five quarter, including four consecutive quarters.The company has not guided for revenue estimates but said previously it expects first-quarter subscription and services revenue to be in a range of $410 million to $480 million.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE – Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High – Here’s When Benzinga Readers Think $100K Milestone Could Be ReachedWhat Analysts Say: The first quarter was an "eventful quarter for the cryptoecosystem," JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase could be a key beneficiary of the increased trading activity.Worthington expects Coinbase to post subscription and services revenue of $450 million. The analyst also sees Base, which is Coinbase's Layer 2 platform, contributing more meaningful in the quarter at around $20 million in net revenue."We see Coinbase as both a leading driver and beneficiary of the cryptocurrency economy, and we previously underestimated the strength of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its early days – launched January 2024 – as a key catalyst for the crypto industry," Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase's revenue generation could benefit in the short term with a crypto rally."We see the longer term success of Coinbase being driven by development, with our focus on tokenization and payments."Key Items to Watch: When Coinbase reported fourth-quarter financial results, the company said its three main priorities for 2024 would be driving revenue through improving core trading, driving utility in crypto with experiments in payments and driving regulatory clarity for the industry.Investors and analysts will watch for all of these items in the upcoming quarterly report.The biggest item likely watched by those looking at Coinbase will be the impact the approval and launch of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs had on the company in the first quarter.Investors will also be looking to see how big of an impact on trading volume and transaction revenues Bitcoin had compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represented 31% of trading volume and 29% of transaction revenues in the fourth quarter.The balance of transaction revenue with the company's subscription and services revenue could also be something to monitor. The transaction revenue is larger but can also be more volatile from quarter to quarter, while the subscription and services revenue is growing and also important for the company increasing efforts for profitability.COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares were up 3% to $210.09 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $46.43 to $283.48.Read Next: Coinbase Up 300% In A Year, But Faces Bearish Technicals Ahead Of Q1 EarningsImage: Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:39 </pubDate></item><item><title>Solana’s Greatest Multichain Meme Coin Dogeverse Bags $13 Million In Ongoing Presale</title><link>https://cryptonews.com/news/solanas-greatest-multichain-meme-coin-dogeverse-bags-13-million-in-ongoing-presale-2.htm</link><description>

                        Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – An ongoing presale for Solana’s greatest multichain good boy Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) has taken in $13 million so far, with at least $2 million flooding into the ICO in the five days since it deployed on Solana.Crypto’s latest Shiba Inu-inspired funny token has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see Dogeverse’s hyper-jumping cross-chain capabilities as a hint of tomorrow’s meme coin capabilities.Now SOL fans are in on the action too. As of Friday, April 26, Dogeverse has rolled out on its sixth native chain, Solana, joining a digital economy that is home to $3.465 billion in total value locked (TVL), with 1.13 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.Since Dogeverse exists on multiple chains, it can be purchased by anyone on Ethereum ($ETH), BNB Smart Chain ($BNB), Polygon ($MATIC), Avalanche ($AVAX), Base ($BASE) and now Solana ($SOL) to spare.To purchase with SOL, simply head to the website and select “Buy With SOL” from the drop-down menu of the buy widget. Doing so will transport users to a Solana-based version of the site hosted on solana.thedogeverse.com.The option to pay with Solana is hosted on a subdomain, due to wallet connect functions not being able to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana-integrated wallets in tandem.The SOL-specific version of the Dogeverse website also adds the ability to buy tokens using Circle’s hugely popular USDC, which is the stablecoin of choice on the Solana network,The Dogeverse ICO and Beyond
Currently priced at $0.000304 and due to rise in a few days, Dogeverse sold out its initial soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launching at the beginning of April.A heady $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated to the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.This enabled Dogeverse to move onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens are being sold to the public across the remaining rounds before the presale closes. Initially, this was planned for June 11, however, due to the immense success of the presale, it’s likely to conclude substantially earlier.The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used to bolster liquidity to ensure high-volume trading and for buy-back funds.Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.Cosmo: Crypto’s New Hyper-Jumping Multi-Chain Good Boy
The market’s appetite for canine-themed coins began with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. Dogecoin didn’t need much of a sales pitch, because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)Since then, many celebrities have professed their love for the novelty canine cryptocurrency, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, American entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg.But fun as it may be, Dogecoin is not without its problems.Since Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, it utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions. This means that the miners with the most computation and power mine the most Dogecoin. Like Bitcoin, mining DOGE consumes a lot of energy.Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but all of them have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.To date, none of the alternative Dogecoins have seriously challenged the original’s dominance.Dogeverse hopes to change that. It is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism.At the center of the Dogeverse is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.Dogeverse and the Ethereum ETF Saga
Analysts are anticipating potentially price-driving news this month, on May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for US spot Ethereum ETFs.The date could mark the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.So will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the Dogeverse.Given the fact that a federal court overturned the SEC’s earlier refusal of Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious” it’s possible that spot Ethereum ETFs will pass through unopposed, smashing the doors down for the approval of similar products for Solana and Avalanche.VIDEOThe ETF effect is a very real catalyst, too. Earlier this year, the US launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs rallied the original cryptocurrency to set a new high watermark of $73,737.94 on March 14.So Cosmo is a clean and green representative of not one, not two, but six different blockchain networks. And with staking capabilities, seamless multi-chain fun and a potentially catalytic news cycle in the coming months, what’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?Join the presale over on the Dogeverse website before the price rises.Social Channels: Twitter | Telegram

                        Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – Crypto’s latest cybernetic sausage dog sensation, AI meme coin WienerAI ($WAI), has added the most advanced beginner-friendly trading bot in crypto to its ecosystem in an ICO that has already attracted over $700,000 in three weeks.The team is touting its new AI companion as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner” with user-friendly AI-enhanced trading, seamless swap functionality and zero fees. With unparalleled capabilities, WienerAI is the ultimate asset for every crypto trader.It couldn’t be easier to get an edge, thanks to WienerAI. Just ask the bot a question relating to whatever your crypto investment needs are, and WienerAI will use its predictive technology to scour the markets to sniff out a winner for his owners, providing them with a breakdown of his logic and analysis.Wiener’s swap feature allows his users to make fast, efficient token swaps and in a few clicks find the best prices available on DEXs.It also has a reflexive edge over frontrunners, like MEV bots. These bots frontrun traders’ transactions in order to profit from minimizing their gains. WienerAI’s cybernetic capabilities get him in front of every frontrunner.WienerAI recalls another successful recent token launch, canine meme coin and AI security token Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY), which netted close to $10 million in a recent presale.Combining two hot niches, both $WAI and $SCOTTY have inspired investors with the promise of a new generation of coins that offer more laughs than run-of-the-mill AI coins and more utility than bog standard meme coins.Other strong narratives driving the project are its eye-watering staking rewards, currently offering yields of 1241% per annum, its verified audit, and the fun, community-building storyline.WienerAI: The Only Sausage/Dog/AI Hybrid
To begin with, investors have probably never heard an origin story like this before. Like his predecessor, Scotty the AI, WienerAI arrives on the scene with a fully-formed backstory.Wiener was born in a lab in New Silicon Valley, AD 2132. His progenitor is a mad puppy-loving scientist known as The Architect, whose life’s work was to create an advanced AI/canine hybrid.Indeed, he succeeded, albeit with one caveat. The Architect was eating a sausage as he was performing the splicing procedure. The accidental result was WienerAI, a hybrid of pup, AI and sausage.Now, the whitepaper mentions “companionship” and “friendship” as key parts of Wiener’s premise. It also mentions “The Sausage Army”, the endearing term for the legions of followers Wiener hopes to attract, so there are subtle hints at a strong social component.He’s not the first crypto doge with an army, but he may be the best.WienerAI Wants To Take Over Crypto’s Doge Scene
The world’s first and favorite meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), also has an army: the self-styled “Doge Army”, but Wiener is aiming for a wider community and he has a decent battle cry to help him rally his sausage forces.See, Dogecoin is one tired pupper. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is housed on its own blockchain, which is a spin on Bitcoin’s. Dogecoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which means that it’s the miners with access to the most power and/or computation that bag the most DOGE.In a world of rising atmospheric temperatures and international climate targets, PoW is a growing concern among more conscientious investors.WienerAI’s native chain, Ethereum, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where the miners that stake the most ETH get the most rewards. This is well over 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.Secondly, in an industry that was rocked by near-constant scandals and liquidity crises in the last two years, WienerAI offers the security of proper auditing. The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. This gives investors added confidence in WienerAI.Lastly, there’s the daily staking rewards. Some 20% of $WAI’s supply is earmarked for staking. Buyers can stake during the presale, and are in fact encouraged to do so on the website, in order to take advantage of the lucrative 1241% APY on offer at present.Mysterious he may be, but it’s no mystery why investors are piling into WienerAI’s new presale. Everybody wants to get their hands on a tokenized piece of crypto’s most advanced beginner-friendly AI trading companion yet.Keep on top of WienerAI’s latest developments on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the website.

Bitcoin Traders Target Test of $53,000 Support as BTC Price Predictions Remains Bearish Following Fed Meeting
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating in the mid-$57,000s, down roughly 5% on the day, though up around 1.5% or $1,000 from earlier session lows as traders weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts this year in wake of the latest policy announcement from the US central bank.As anticipated, the Fed left interest rates at multi-decade high levels of 5.25-5.5% and slowed its balance sheet run-off.The central bank will now allow its portfolio of assets to shrink by only $25 billion per month. Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate and could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.Bitcoin briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s, and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands roughly in line with where it was before the Fed’s announcement.As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.He commented that gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than expected.According to CME data, the money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago.Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.Ultimately, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?
While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside is coming.Prior to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.That drop came after it fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.The decrease from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and accelerated ETF outflows.According to data presented by The Block, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five days straight.The drop in Bitcoin prices from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and as ETF outflows accelerate. Source: The BlockImportantly, Wednesday’s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.The next major level of support for the Bitcoin price isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000. Source: TradingViewMany analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s.A few analysts mentioned that the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 is important to watch.“There might have been lots of ‘TradFi’ tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.  “This time is now over. We expect more unwinding as… Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to… a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top. That explains our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks.”

While Probing Security Status? - DailyCoin</title><link>https://dailycoin.com/sec-to-ok-leveraged-eth-etfs-while-probing-security-status/?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss</link><description>
        
The SEC may be set to approve leveraged ETH futures ETFs.



The likely approval comes despite an ongoing investigation into whether Ethereum is an unregistered security.



At the same time, the SEC continues to delay a decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.
The debacle over the SEC’s classification of Ethereum is getting more complicated.Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the regulator has the second largest crypto asset in terms of market cap in its cross-hairs, suspecting that the asset may be an unregistered security. For the observers, the situation recently got more complicated as a recent ConsenSys complaint revealed that the SEC’s Ethereum probe has been on for at least a year, months before the agency implicitly signed off on the CFTC’s classification of ETH as a commodity by approving ETH futures ETFs.Adding to the growing confusion over the SEC’s stance, the agency now looks set to approve leveraged ETH ETF products.Leveraged ETH Futures ETF Applicants Feeling “Optimistic”On Wednesday, May 1, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that leveraged ETH futures ETF applicants felt “optimistic” about their chances of getting approval, citing persons familiar with the matter. The journalist disclosed that these institutions expressed this view based on “positive dialogue” from the SEC. If the SEC gives the green light as they expect, Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) will be the first to go live on June 4.  As Terrett highlighted, approving these products will add another layer of intrigue to the Ethereum security status debacle.By approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs, the SEC will stir further confusion by again implicitly accepting the CFTC’s classification of the crypto asset while pending an investigation into whether it is a security.
Stressing the potential implications of the move, Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnsson asserted that the SEC’s decision on the matter would be “key to watch.”Beyond the apparent inconsistencies in the regulator’s actions, from a risk perspective, most could not understand the logic of approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs while delaying spot ETFs.“Make It Make Sense”For months, the SEC has delayed its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, offering no reason for the delay except that it required more time to review applications. With the May 23 deadline for the agency to decide on VanEck’s application looming, the growing consensus among observers and even some applicants is that this application will be denied.Many have regarded the possibility of the SEC first approving leveraged futures ETFs, which arguably pose greater investment risks than spot offerings, as odd.Angel Investor Eric Conner sarcastically quipped, “Make so much sense… Much protection!”Chiming in, The ETF Store, Inc. President Nate Geraci added, “Somebody make it make sense.”On the Flipside 
The SEC has yet to officially approve the leveraged ETH futures ETFs.



It will not be the first time the SEC approved leveraged futures ETFs before the spot. The agency had approved leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs about six months before finally approving the spot product.

                            Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment.
Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash
In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his expectations for altcoins. According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come.

Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow.
The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said.
Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated.
If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The altcoin market cap has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion.
Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market
While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the impact on altcoins has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader Dogecoin dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and Shiba Inu fell 4.18%.
Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with Optimism (OP) recording 12% gains. Cosmos (ATOM) followed with a 9.8% increase, and Starknet (STRK) rose 9%, making them the top gainers of the day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Chainlink (LINK) is currently facing bearish woes and could react to them by noting a price drop. This is essential for the altcoin to initiate a recovery that could help gain the losses noted recently.
Investors are exhibiting short-term pessimism, which aligns with the predicted outcome for the LINK price.
Chainlink Investors Could Make a Move Soon
LINK price is anticipating a decline, and the network is not keen on changing the outcome. The recent correction eliminated any incentive for new investors to jump aboard the Chainlink train. This is evident in the network growth, which has dipped to a yearly low. 
Network growth is calculated based on the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network. This data determines whether or not a project is losing traction in the market.

Given Chainlink’s network growth is so low, it seems probable that LINK is not attracting any new users at the moment. This could negatively impact the price of the token.

Secondly, LINK is highly undervalued at the moment, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This, however, is a bullish development. 
The MVRV ratio measures investor profit/loss. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV at -16% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation. 
Historically, LINK price recovery occurs at -7% and -17% MVRV, labeling it an opportunity zone. Nevertheless, there is still some room before LINK investors purchase the token right now to initiate a recovery.

LINK Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch
LINK price, trading at $12.7 at the time of writing, is below the support of $13.2. This is a crucial level because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement.
Further decline is likely should LINK fall below the support at $12.7. Considering the market conditions, LINK will potentially drop to $11.7 before bouncing back up.

However, if the support at $12.7 remains intact and Chainlink reclaims 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement as support, it could initiate a recovery. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and enable a rise to $14.8 and beyond.

								The foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has entered a major accumulation zone, suggesting that this may be the right time to invest in the crypto token. This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a trend reversal from the current downtrend that it is experiencing. 
Dogecoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Is A Buy Signal
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio is around -15%, meaning many Dogecoin holders are currently at a loss. This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued.

Besides new investors, Dogecoin’s current holders are also expected to use this opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin in a bid to break even in their positions. This already looks to be happening, as data from IntoTheBlock shows a notable increase in the token supply held by long-term holders (more than a year).
Crypto investors buying up the Dogecoin dip can add significant buying pressure to the crypto token, which could spark a price recovery amidst this market downtrend. Moreover, on-chain data shows that Dogecoin whales are also accumulating during this period. Specifically, 150,000,000 DOGE were transferred from the crypto trading platform Robinhood to an unknown wallet, while another 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred from Robinhood to that wallet. 
These whales have a massive influence on the market, and their buys could positively impact DOGE’s price. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that this price recovery looks imminent for DOGE, considering that recovery has historically always occurred around this MVRV range. 
What DOGE Chart Is Saying
Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) recently stated that Dogecoin is currently at a “major support zone, one which he believes that the meme coin shouldn’t lose if the crypto market is indeed in a “real bull market.” The analyst mentioned in an earlier X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin needs to hold above this level to remain bullish.

However, Dogecoin risks dropping below that level, especially with the current market-wide downtrend with Bitcoin leading the charge. Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to announce the rate decision on May 1, which could cause DOGE and other crypto tokens to decline further if they decide to take a hawkish stance and increase interest rates.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDuring a presentation at the annual MicroStrategy World conference in Las Vegas, MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor unveiled the open-source MicroStrategy Orange Decentralized Identity protocol.“Michael presented a very compelling case for why we need decentralized identity and did decentralized identifiers,” MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering Cezary Raczko told the audience. “He made an even more compelling case why it makes sense to anchor digital identity into the Bitcoin blockchain, protected by the strength and the security of the Bitcoin network.”Alongside the announcement, MicroStrategy published an unofficial draft of the MicroStrategy Orange specification to Github.While the timing of the news was unexpected, Saylor previously hinted that his company was working in the identity and authentication space. He told Decrypt last year that MicroStrategy was more than aware of Ordinals after the protocol launched in January, and interested in exploring how it could inspire software innovations.“The whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,” Saylor said. “Right now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin.”The Bitcoin advocate said that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could introduce an entirely new level of security.“The platform consists of three fundamental pieces, Raczko said late Wednesday.“At the heart of it is a service cloud, hosted, that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users in your organization,” he explained. “It also allows you to deploy prepackaged out-of-the-box applications that run on the MicroStrategy Orange platform.”Raczko said the Orange software development kit will make it easy for coders to take these capabilities and integrate them into their own applications and systems.Using email as an example, Raczko said Bitcoin-based public and private keys generated using MicroStrategy Orange would be inscribed using the Ordinals protocol.According to the MicroStrategy Orange documentation, the decentralized identity protocol uses a modified approach to inscriptions as Ordinals, but stores only data related to decentralized identity (DID), meaning documents can be created and updated with few restrictions on size and content while taking advantage of the segregated witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin.“Once you've established that that email is genuine, you accept the invitation, and at that point, we're going to generate your unique decentralized identifier, and the public and private key pair,” Raczko explained. “We're going to send a decentralized identifier and the public key to the Orange server to be inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain, [and] from that point onward, you are ready to start sending Orange-signed or emails.”“[The] opportunity we see and want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger, verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin,” Raczko said.He added that the MicroStrategy Orange decentralized identifier could also be used to verify users on social media applications or authenticate a text message, college degree or medical record.“Present those and then have those verified all in a decentralized way, but with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain,” Raczko added—suggesting that Orange could make it possible to display an “orange check” for verified users across platforms.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:45 </pubDate></item><item><title>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms reports record $211M Q1 net income</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/riot-platforms-q1-results-record-211-million-net-income</link><description>Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Riot Platforms reported a $211.8 million net income for Q1 2024 — a company record and a 1,000% increase from the same time last year — but missed analyst revenue estimates.Riot’s first quarter results released May 1 show minin revenue spiked 55.4% year-on-year to $74.6 million, primarily driven by a 131% increase in Bitcoin’s price.The firm's total revenue was $79.3 million, fallin 14% short of estimates by research firm Zacks.The miner said a rise in net income and mining revenue was partially slowed by lower Bitcoin production and higher mining costs due to an increase in Bitcoin’s network difficulty and hash rate.Riot’s unaudited financial statement for Q1 2024.

								Solana (SOL) co-founder Raj Gokal is naming two blockchains that have a head start in the sovereign blockchains crypto sub-sector.
At a TOKEN2049 panel discussion, Gokal says that Avalanche (AVAX) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM) are “the clear winners” with regard to sovereign blockchains.










A sovereign blockchain is typically under the control of a single entity, unlike public blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC) which are decentralized.
According to Gokal, Cosmos Hub and Avalanche have some differences that set them apart.
“Cosmos is an old-school project and it’s not that coordinated. I think Avalanche brings the coordination and the ability for developers to configure their own chains how they want. So I like that about their design. And obviously, it’s a function of Emi’s [Gün Sirer] DNA and his great vision as a founder.”
On the Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer, Gokal further says,
“I think Solana loves competition. We love fierce competition, we love honest competition from people who have ferocity about the ideas they’re bringing to the table. 
And I think Emin is probably the most ferocious layer-1 [blockchain] founder that I know. And he never backs down from a fight. But he will shake your hand behind the stage and he’s friends with everyone. And he’s been very supportive of a lot of founders. 
So I think as an individual I have a lot of respect for Emin and what he’s brought to the space.”

After Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao, Roger Ver is under the radar of the U.S. government. 
Diverse reactions within the crypto community highlight industry complexities amid legal actions.

The year 2024 is proving to be a golden age for cryptocurrencies, with the exponential growth of this asset class coinciding with a surge in crypto voters. 
Notably, a significant portion of this surge in crypto adoption occurred after the 2020 presidential election. Following Biden’s election, there was an unprecedented wave of retail adoption within the cryptocurrency industry.
However, as the U.S. elections 2024 approaches, an unexpected development has emerged. 
The United States Department of Justice has announced charges against Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” on allegations of tax evasion.
Diverging perspective 
Various execs have weighed in on the matter, speculating that it is an anti-crypto stance within the Biden administration.
Highlighting consecutive arrests by the U.S. government, including Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, and now Roger Ver, David Shares, a crypto expert noted, 
“The U.S. is aggressively coming after crypto. Just look at the recent targets. If you think you’re not a target, think again. They will come after all of us at some point. We have to fight!” 
Echoing similar sentiments, Jane Adams, a 2024 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and a supporter of Bitcoin, said,

However, some execs believed in the steps taken by the U.S. Voicing his apprehensions against Ver, Bitcoin educator, Dan Held said, 
“Good. He’s been a net negative for Bitcoin.” 
Adding to the fray, an X user, @koinosthegoat, claimed,

These contrasting perspectives underscore the complexities and divisions within the crypto space, suggesting potential implications for the upcoming U.S. elections.
What’s more to it? 
As a matter of fact, Ver was arrested in Spain on the 30th of April, following criminal charges in the U.S. for offenses including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. 
The DoJ alleges that Ver avoided taxes totaling $48 million on his Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sales in 2017. According to a press release by the DoJ,

However, despite renouncing his US citizenship in 2014, Ver faces extradition to the United States, prompting criticism from crypto veterans and social media users. 
Amidst this criticism, Kim Dotcom, a crypto veteran who himself was in the same shoes a few years ago, remarked,
“This indictment has nothing to do with tax evasion. This is a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.” 
As things unfold, it will be interesting to watch how the upcoming U.S. elections will shape the future of cryptocurrency in the States.

Celestia (TIA) is prone to further correction after consistently forming red candlesticks over the past few days. The saving grace is that investors are not too keen on saving the altcoin either.
The most likely outcome for TIA is a five-month low since it follows the cues set by Bitcoin, which dropped below $60,000.
Celestia Investors Save Their Money
Celestia’s price decline resulted from the crypto market noting a bearish couple of days in the previous month. However, the broader impact has been on the traders who have opted to withdraw from the asset for now.
This is noted in the decline in the Open Interest (OI), which in the past month has been reduced by 50%. At the end of March, a total of $233 million worth of shorts and long contracts were opened in the market. This has since come down to $113 million, less than half of the original OI.
This shows that the investors only focus on profitable actions, which could take a while.

The reason behind this delay is the correlation that TIA shares with Bitcoin. A high correlation of 0.96 exhibits a tethered price action of both assets, with TIA following BTC’s cues. Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is witnessing a bearish outlook, with Bitcoin’s price trading below $60,000.

Further decline in BTC is anticipated, and the condition of Celestia’s price is also the same. Thus, the altcoin could observe some drawdown in the coming days.

TIA Price Prediction: Drop to $7 
Celestia’s price is testing the support marked at $9.2, which could fail to hold, resulting in a price correction to the next area of support at $8.3. But if this level breaks, it would validate the bearish thesis, causing the TIA price to correct further and hit $7.

However, if the $8.3 support floor holds strong enough to prevent a decline, TIA could bounce back. Reclaiming the $10 would wipe out half the losses noted and invalidate the bearish thesis.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Build on Bitcoin (BOB) project announced the launch of its first phase on Wednesday, enabling decentralized apps—dapps—to interact with the world’s top blockchain.The BOB mainnet is coming online with $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and over 40 dapps already available, the team said on Twitter, declaring “a Bitcoin-driven DeFi summer” with more to come in the next three weeks.Build on Bitcoin is intended to be a hybrid layer-2 network, an “Ethereum rollup” that merges Bitcoin’s global adoption, liquidity, and proof-of-work security with the decentralized finance (DeFi) features of Ethereum: smart contracts, wallets, and access to stablecoins.In March, Bitcoin DeFi developer Sovryn used Build on Bitcoin to expand its offerings to the Ethereum ecosystem. BOB is meanwhile collaborating with Threshold’s tBTC and Wrapped BTC (WBTC).“We currently work with the two leading BTC bridge providers while working on our bridge infrastructure in parallel,” BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin told Decrypt. “We built a one-click onramp from Bitcoin to BOB that abstracts bridge complexity and makes moving liquidity from BTC to BOB as easy as moving from ETH to an ETH L2 going live next week.”Zamyatin said Build on Bitcoin is also looking to provide a one-stop shop for Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, working with teams that provide bridges for Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 tokens.Image: Build on BitcoinWhile Bitcoin DeFi is the goal, the BOB team acknowledged that the number one blockchain is not ready, making “bootstrapping” on Ethereum necessary.“Connecting to Ethereum follows a pragmatic rollout approach,” the team said. “Bitcoin rollups do not yet work, but demand is high: Bitcoin users need access to stablecoins and DeFi, Ethereum users want to use their BTC and get access to Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s.”“It is time to end the cult-like feuds and unite the two largest Web3 ecosystems to spearhead mass adoption together,” BOB declared.According to Zamyatin, the next phase of BOB’s development will achieve Bitcoin proof of work via “merged mining,” enhancing security without disrupting Bitcoin mining. Merged mining refers to the process of mining two or more blockchains at the same time.“Previous merged mining instances suffered from slow block times (30sec-1min) due to the limitations of Proof-of-Work,” he said.Finally, the third planned phase will introduce BitVM, enabling a secure BTC bridge with fraud proofs similar to Ethereum's bridges, BOB explains, ensuring safe BTC deposits enforced by Bitcoin nodes.“This ensures that users bridging in BTC can be certain that their deposits are safe and security is enforced by all Bitcoin full nodes—as long as there is at least one person online to submit a fraud-proof,” he said, noting Arbitrum on Ethereum.To draw more users to its platform, Zamyatin pointed to a BOB fusion program that the company is using to boost adoption through dapps that increase the TVL and number of users.According to the Build on Bob website, the total value locked on the platform is currently over $279 million.“BOB Fusion Season 1 attracted 300 million in TVL from 33,000 users in 4 weeks,” Zamyatin said. “BOB Season 2 that launched today saw $64 million in on-chain TVL inflow in less than 12 hours.”“Our mission is to make BTC deployment into DeFi super easy,” Zamyatin said. “Think Yearn Finance for Bitcoin, and make Bitcoin assets accessible to Ethereum and EVM users—uniting the two largest web3 power-user ecosystems.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:16:47 </pubDate></item><item><title>Here Are Your Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener</title><link>https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers-today-on-dexscreener-aitax-america-booe.htm</link><description>

                        In wake of the cryptocurrency market’s latest tumble which saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop convincingly below $60,000 for the first time since late February, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin was last trading in the $57,000s as traders digest the latest Fed policy announcement. Negative ETF flows are also on their radar, with Bitcoin ETFs having seen outflows now for five straight days.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.Most altcoins are also in the red. That is encouraging traders looking to turn a quick profit to turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or scams. But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayAITaxBot (AITAX)A newly launched crypto called AITaxBot (AITAX) is up 1800% on Wednesday, as per DEXScreener.The shitcoin last had a market cap of $370,000, with $130,000 in locked liquidity, with volumes so far of $520,000.The token has four concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per Go+ Security. Investors need to be cautious.America (AMERICA)A meme coin called America (AMERICA) that was launched three days ago continues to push higher.It was last up 220% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $5.1 million as per DEXScreener. It also has a solid $260,000 in locked liquidity.The meme coin has been on a donating spree to US veterans.Donations to good causes are an interesting and commendable marketing strategy for a meme coin.That could explain why AMERICA keeps pumping. Hopefully, it sets a trend.The token has two smart contract issues, as per Go+ Security.Book of Ethereum (BOOE)A meme coin called Book of Ethereum (BOOE) challenged its record highs on Wednesday following a 50% intra-day gains.That according to DEXScreener, that puts its market cap at $3.3 million and liquidity at $270,000.BOOE has no issues with its smart contract and appears not to be a scam. That being said, investors must always do their due diligence and remember that the vast majority of newly launched coins do not retain long-term value.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify altcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

                        An Argentinian lawmaker has launched a draft bill that proposes regulating Worldcoin and its operator in the Latin American nation.The move comes just days after Worldcoin announced a planned expansion in Mexico. Some Mexican lawmakers have also called for a probe into operator Tools for Humanity.Argentina Lawmaker: We Must Protect Consumer Rights
Per the official news outlet of the Buenos Aires assembly, the new bill is the brainchild of Buenos Aires parliament member Carlos Puglelli.The MP, and others, have claimed it is “unclear” what Worldcoin does with the biometric data it collects using its iris-scanning drives.Puglelli’s bill proposes “regulating companies that scan people’s irises for the purpose of collecting biometric data.”The bill’s author noted that Buenos Aires authorities should be allowed to “exercise control over activities carried out by companies like Worldcoin.”He also called for more “transparency” about happens to the biometric data that “users deliver to these companies, in this case in exchange for a payment in cryptocurrency.”Worldcoin has proven a hit in Argentina, where it operates over 50 iris-scanning centers.Buenos Aires MPs Want Worldcoin Investigation
The crypto project has piqued the interest of more Argentina lawmakers.In mid-April, Romina Braga, another member of the Buenos Aires assembly, called for an official investigation into Worldcoin.Braga called on Axel Kicillof, the Governor of the Buenos Aires Province, to commission an investigation. She also voiced several privacy and data-related concerns.A Worldcoin retina scanner orb. (Source: Steve Jurvetson [CC By 2.0])This follows a move from the national data protection agency, which announced the launch of an investigation into Worldcoin in January this year.Puglelli’s bill calls for the creation of a “regulatory framework” that regulates biometric data collection and introduces punishments for any “abuse” of this data. He explained:“It is essential to adapt our legislation to meet the challenges posed by the digital era.”Regulator to Get Involved?
The bill, if adopted, would see the Provincial Directorate for the Defense of the Rights of Consumers and Users appointed as the “supervisor” of Worldcoin.The Directorate would be charged with “promoting fair and equitable consumer relations in the digital sphere, as well as trust and IT security.”The media outlet Criptonoticias reported that Worldcoin has been operating in Argentina “for more than a year.”It added that “thousands of citizens have transferred their biometric data to the Cayman Islands-based firm.”Will Lawmakers Get Their Way?
Both Puglelli and Braga have complained that “it is not clear” exactly “what Worldcoin does with iris-scanned data.”The lawmaker warned that Worldcoin “has no legal status in Argentina and is acquiring biometric data in a way that puts privacy at stake.”.It remains to be seen if the lawmakers’ warnings will dampen public enthusiasm.However, they do not appear to be alone. The Buenos Aires Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation says it has also investigated Worldcoin’s data protection credentials.Mexican lawmakers have also raised concerns. In Chile, another country with multiple data collection centers, government agents have inspected three Worldcoin-related addresses.Agents asked the firm to submit “additional information” to “ensure that Worldcoin is complying with national regulations.”Data-related concerns have disrupted Worldcoin iris-scanning efforts in European nations, including Spain, Germany, and France.Government agencies in East Asian nations such as South Korea and Hong Kong have also launched Worldcoin-related investigations.

Best Crypto to Buy Now May 1 – Wormhole, Optimism, Axelar
                        As traders digest the implications of the latest Fed policy announcement and what it means for the outlook for Fed rate cuts later this year, traders are hunting for opportunities in the altcoin market and weighing up what might be the best crypto to buy today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $57,000s, down over 4% in the past 24 hours.Ether (ETH) was last trading about 1% lower just to the south of $3,000.The sell pressure comes as Bitcoin ETF outflows pick up and US economic data points to sticky inflation.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.Bitcoin isn’t the best crypto to buy today, with ETFs seeing five days of consecutive outflows. Source: The BlockThis has dampened the outlook for Fed rate cuts, with most now expecting nothing until late 2024.Bitcoin bears are now targeting a test of support in the $53,000. This could be a compelling area to buy the dip.Bitcoin would have fallen around 30% from its March highs at this point. Assuming we are in a bull market, many long-term bulls might view a 30% retracement as a great time to get back in.That suggests Bitcoin could soon be the best coin to buy, but it isn’t yet.Investors looking to bank quick gains will have to be more selective, finding altcoins with strong momentum.Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Wednesday that could be the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayWormhole (W)Investors monitoring altcoins markets for which crypto to invest in on Wednesday should check out Wormhole (W).Wormhole is the top-performing coin in the top 100 by market cap on Monday, as per CoinMarketCap.W was last up 11% in 24 hours and is probing two-week highs around $0.68.Wormhole is a multi-chain protocol that facilitates the movement of assets and data between blockchains.If it can break above recent highs in the $0.70 area, a quick rally back towards $1.0 is possible.Wormhole might be the best crypto to buy today.

But bulls won’t be celebrating until it can break to the north of resistance around $2.85.But given it recently broke above a downtrend from the March highs, OP’s outlook is strong.Given it recently broke above a downtrend from the March highs, OP’s outlook is strong.

The prospect of quick gains makes it potentially the best crypto to buy today.Axelar (AXL)Web3 interoperability platform Axelar (AXL) is pumping on Wednesday, up 8.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.Last at $1.15, the cryptocurrency has found strong support above $1.0 this week.Traders will be hoping this bounce could be the start of a more than 2x push higher back above $2.0.If this is the start of a new AXL run, it could well be the best crypto to buy today.But first, it will need to surpass $1.30 resistance.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify altcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

                        Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to offer a Canadian dollar stablecoin on its platform shortly after receiving an official license to operate within Canada.In a Twitter update on Monday, the company said it had added QCAD (QCAD) to its listing roadmap – a CAD-pegged stablecoin that was “re-launched” by Canadian fintech firm Stablecorp last year.Canadian Dollar Stablecoin On Coinbase
Much like other popular stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), QCAD maintains its peg with full backing by reserves of equal or greater value to the number of tokens that have been issued.According to Stablecorp, these tokens are backed by cash and cash equivalents, with monthly attestation reports to verify their reserve status. Its latest attestation report in February 2024 said there were just 169,303.77 QCAD in circulation versus CAD $200,903.17 in Stablecorp’s reserves.That’s a small amount relative to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC, which have over $140 billion USD worth of tokens combined spread throughout the crypto ecosystem.“Our goal is to list every asset possible that meets our standards for legal, compliance, and technical security,” Coinbase’s blog post on upcoming listings stated. “These standards do not take into account the market cap or popularity of a project.”As such, onboarding Coinbase – the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the only publicly traded firm of its kind – could be a boon for adoption.“With increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin,” said Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall last year.Compliance With Canadian Regulators
Shortly after the collapse of FTX and Terra in 2022, the CSA issued guidance to crypto trading platforms, establishing a high bar for stablecoins or other pegged assets to receive listing. Stablecoins would require reserves of “highly liquid assets” with “qualified custodians,” and algorithmic stablecoins were completely ruled out.The strict guidance contributed to Kraken and Coinbase delisting USDT and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from their platforms and to Binance moving out of the country entirely.Coinbase became the first international crypto exchange to gain registration as a “restricted dealer” in Canada last month, however, signaling its sufficient compliance with regulators.The company has often credited Canadian regulators with being cooperative with the crypto industry in ways that U.S. regulators are not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, is currently suing Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance for securities law violations.“We’ve collaborated with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to demonstrate our dedication to facilitating their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset realm,” the company wrote last month.

Stacks Price Prediction as STX Token Slides Under $2 – How Low Will STX Go?
                        As Bitcoin (BTC) corrects to its lowest levels in over two months below $60,000, its largest layer-2 scaling blockchain Stacks (STX) is also in decline, with the Stacks price hitting its lowest levels since mid-February below $2.0.The Stacks price has since bounced back to around $2.14, with STX now flat on the day.But it might not be long until STX breaks more forcefully to the downside of $2.06 and the $2.0 level.That’s because Stacks largely takes it cue from what Bitcoin is doing, as well as how altcoins are performing.And, as of now, pretty much the entire crypto space in a state of bearishness.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have been negative now for five days, as per data presented by The Block.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.That’s not surprising given recent macro headwinds. While today’s Fed policy announcement didn’t contain any surprises, it reinforced the message that rate cuts remain some way off.The Fed has turned more hawkish recently due to inflation remaining uncomfortably high since the start of 2024.It’s no surprise then that the Bitcoin price, as well as altcoin markets, have suffered a correction.Here’s Where the Stacks Price Is Headed Next
So, risks seem tilted to the downside for Stacks (STX). The next major support level, assuming the January highs at $2.06 goes, is the 200DMA.The 200DMA currently resides just above $1.80. A break below here would send a significant bearish signal.The next major area of support that traders would target would be around $1.25.If Stacks was to fall 40% to here, its market cap would subside to under $2 billion.This could be a great time to load up on STX, which remains a major leader in Bitcoin layer-2 scaling.The Stacks price could slump all the way as low as $1.25 support. Source: TradingViewAmid the bearish outlook for altcoins like Stacks, traders are hunting for alternatives that could deliver near-term upside.Presale investing is an often-overlooked strategy that can deliver strong returns.And one presale has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews – Mega Dice.The well-established crypto casino just launched a presale of its utility token DICE.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can also generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors.The project has already raised $660,000. And potential investors better move quickly, as when the $1 million milestone is hit, the DICE price will rise.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Martinez highlighted the potential for a substantial Bitcoin surge, based on historical trends.“The last three times the #Bitcoin 30-day MVRV dropped below -9% in the last two years, the price of $BTC surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. The #BTC 30-day MVRV is currently at -11.6%, suggesting it may be time to buy the dip!” Martinez wrote.The MVRV ratio, which divides an asset’s market capitalization by its realized capitalization, is a pivotal metric in the crypto space.

On the same day, Bitcoin’s value dropped below $58,000, triggering losses for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD.Moreover, crypto research firm 10x Research has predicted a further 20% drop in Bitcoin’s value, citing the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.However, if Martinez’s analysis holds true, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a remarkable recovery. This is particularly noteworthy in light of concerns raised by analysts about potential selling pressure from retail “degens” who bought Bitcoin ETFs at around $58,000.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours.

								On Tuesday, the crypto industry was shaken after news of the indictment of one of a Bitcoin early investors broke. Per the reports, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pressed multiple charges against Roger Ver, a controversial figure in the space known as “Bitcoin Jesus.”
Experts and figures within the community have expressed their sentiments about Ver’s arrestment, with some considering the US administration is on a “crypto witch-hunt.”

Was Roger Ver’s Indictment Celebrated?
On April 30, Roger Ver was detained by Spanish authorities on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and false tax returns. The indictment came the same day as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao’s four-month sentence.
The prosecutors allege that Ver, who renounced his US citizenship in 2014, failed to report the gains from Bitcoin sales held by his US companies and consequently failed to pay the required taxes.
As a result, the “Bitcoin Jesus” is now being accused of causing a $48 million loss to the IRS, and the US is seeking his extradition from Spain.
After the news, several crypto experts and community members commented on the charges, some considering it a “good” thing. Bitcoin educator and investor Dan Held was among those who “celebrated” the detention.


In an X post, Held stated that Roger Ver has “been a negative for Bitcoin.” To the investor, Ver “misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he’s about to get.”
Some members of the crypto community partially agreed with Held’s sentiment. One X user considers Ver responsible for attempting to destroy Bitcoin during the “Blocksize War.”
DOJ Faces Backlash For “Overreaching” And Unclear Crypto Landscape
Overall, the sentiment leans against Roger Ver’s prosecution. To many, the DOJ’s actions are part of the US government’s efforts to target the crypto industry. 2024 US House candidate Jane Adams called the indictment “a blatant attack on dissent,” adding that the US administration’s “pursuit is fueled by vindictiveness, not justice.”
Similarly, founder and CEO of Layer Two Labs Paul Sztorc also expressed his concern: “Not exactly government via the consent of the governed…,” he stated in an X post.
According to crypto investor and expert Kim Dotcom, the charges against Ver “has nothing to do with tax evasion.” Instead, the crypto veteran considers that the US government is on a witch-hunt, “a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.”


The investor argues that at the time of the Bitcoin sales used for the indictment, the crypto industry was “the wild west of investing.” As a result, there were no clear regulations and guidance on the cryptocurrency’s legal status:

How do you assess the value of such an illiquid asset back in 2014? To now claim, a decade later, that Roger owes $50 million in taxes to the US Govt is ludicrous (…) It’s also a hopeless attempt to attach a value to something that was trading in a fragile, volatile and unregulated market in 2014.

The crypto community has widely discussed the US’s unclear and inconsistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Consensys’ recent demand against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlighted the contradictory guidance from the country’s regulators.
These contradictions have caused US congress members like Patrick McHenry to consider the SEC’s efforts to regulate “by enforcement” to be driven by an “arbitrary and capricious nature.” Ultimately, it urges “a clear regulatory framework and robust consumer protections for digital asset markets.”

Orange Service allows users to issue DIDs to their personnel and deploy applications, while Orange SDK and Orange Applications provide customization tools to integrate specific services on mobile and desktop devices.One application already built by MicroStrategy is “Orange For Outlook,” which integrates digital signatures into emails to ensure recipients can verify the true identity of the sender.The onboarding process involves accepting an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, which will then generate a unique DID, a public and private key pair for the user.

                            Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as it has entered a ‘danger zone,’ according to prominent gold advocate Peter Schiff. This investor, known for his skepticism toward Bitcoin, suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering a “do or die” phase, potentially marking the end of its bullish run if current trends continue.
Breaking Points And Bearish Signals
Peter Schiff has often voiced his bearish outlook on Bitcoin, and his latest comments come as Bitcoin has just slipped below the crucial $60,000 mark.

This level had previously served as strong support during the short-term bull run, and its breach has intensified the bearish sentiment among investors. Schiff warns that staying below this threshold could spell doom for the bullish fervor, potentially derailing Bitcoin’s momentum.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $57,054, teetering close to its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Schiff points out that remaining below this EMA could confirm a bearish trend, signaling an end to the rally.
Amidst these developments, the market has seen an increase in trading volume, coupled with the price drop, indicating strong selling pressure.
Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped from $45 billion to $48 billion, coinciding with a 6.3% price dip during the same period. This heightened activity is a traditional bearish indicator, lending weight to Schiff’s prediction of a downturn.
Moreover, investor sentiment is treading thin ice with significant outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, hitting a weekly high of $162 million. This departure of funds is particularly poignant as it unfolds just before the FOMC meeting, where potential interest rate hikes are on the agenda.
These outflows reflect a broader market trend, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experiencing a substantial daily outflow of $93.23 million.

The Bitcoin ETF Conundrum And Market Forecasts
It is worth noting that last month was quite challenging for US Bitcoin ETFs. After a promising start with positive inflows in the initial months following their launch, April witnessed collective outflows amounting to $182 million across all active spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.

This pullback is attributed to macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions, which have clouded the investment landscape.

As the market braces for further turbulence, analysts such as Micheal Van de Poppe are forecasting an additional correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price down to $55,000 before any sign of recovery.

								In the face of growing global regulatory pressure on the crypto industry, the Biden administration’s intensified crackdown and the actions of regulatory bodies have prompted Senator Cynthia Lummis to issue a strong statement against the US government’s stance on the industry. 
Senator Lummis, a prominent supporter of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, has advocated for the companies and players involved in the ongoing regulatory pressure.
Lummis Condemns DOJ’s “Hyper-Aggressive” Stance
Lummis expressed deep concern and opposed the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” argument that non-custodial software could be classified as a money transmission service. 
The Senator deemed this stance contradictory to existing Treasury guidance, lacking common sense, and violating the rule of law. 

Lummis further emphasized that arguments against self-custody software pose a threat to fundamental property rights that are intrinsic to being an American. 
Lummis asserted her commitment to fighting for individuals’ rights to hold their keys and operate their nodes, expressing her dismay at the Biden administration’s criminalization of the core tenets of the Bitcoin (BTC) network and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Senator Lummis had previously disapproved of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) escalated crackdown on the crypto industry throughout 2023. 
Criticizing the SEC’s actions as “unnecessary” and “overreaching,” she specifically opposed the agency’s controversial new crypto policy, known as “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,” issued in March 2022. 
Lummis had also filed an amicus brief in support of the Coinbase exchange against the SEC’s lawsuit, arguing that Congress should be responsible for formulating crypto regulations rather than the SEC. 
The pro-crypto Senator contended that the SEC had exceeded its mandate by attempting to classify almost all crypto assets as “securities,” thus infringing on Congress’s legislative authority and extending beyond the agency’s jurisdiction.
Clear Guidelines For Crypto Regulation
In another statement supporting key players in the crypto market, Senator Lummis called for immediate action to establish clear regulatory guidelines in response to Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP should not be considered a security. 

At the core of the debate is the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an investment qualifies as a security. Lummis has emphasized the importance of preserving the integrity of this test while acknowledging the need to apply it appropriately to digital assets.
To address these issues, Senator Lummis, in collaboration with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, has introduced the Lummis-Gillibrand bill. The legislation aims to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets like XRP, aligning their treatment with the interpretation of the Howey Test as established by the Southern District of New York.

He noted the significant repricing of Fed cuts due to consistently disappointing inflation data.“While April proved to be the toughest month so far in 2024 for some of them, the year-to-date returns remain solid overall — especially given the extent to which markets have repriced their expectations of Fed cuts in response to repeatedly disappointing inflation data,” El-Erian wrote. He shared a table, covering the performance of major indices from 2020 to Apr. 30, which shows diverse results across different asset classes and regions. Notably, Bitcoin BTC/USD has been the top performer in all asset classes.The indices covered include the DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, Stoxx Euro 600, FTSE 100 Index, Shanghai Composite Index, NIKKEI 225 Index, Gold, Oil, and Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s journey has been particularly volatile, with a 303.95% surge in 2020, followed by a 64.21% drop in 2022. However, it made a strong comeback in 2023 with a 153.32% gain. As of Apr. 30, its year-to-date performance stands at a solid 39.09%, demonstrating its resilience amidst market fluctuations.See Also: Is The ‘Memecoin Supercycle’ Over? Mad Crypto Alpha With IvanWhy It Matters: El-Erian’s insights come at a time when the Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady, emphasizing the need to allow more time for restrictive monetary policies to bring inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal. This decision has had a significant impact on market dynamics."The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said today, adding that it is likely that gaining greater confidence in disinflation will take longer than previously thought.Addressing concerns about potential rate hikes due to recent inflationary pressures, Powell said: "I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. We'd need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% overtime. That's not what we think we're seeing."Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s historical data suggests a potential 99% surge, according to a prominent crypto analyst. This insight, combined with El-Erian’s observations, underscores the complex dynamics at play in the current market.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain tailored for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, has witnessed a dramatic 500% increase in transaction fees within a 24-hour period, as shown by Shibariumscan data. 



Fees paid in BONE, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, escalated from 12 BONE to 61.47 BONE. 




Shibarium’s core functionality involves processing Shiba Inu token transfers, with BONE tokens utilized to pay for transaction costs. 



Each transaction also aids in reducing the supply of SHIB tokens, as a part of the BONE fees is converted to SHIB and then removed from circulation by being sent to a “dead wallet.”



The sharp rise in Shibarium’s fees is primarily linked to a surge in network activity, driven by increasing popularity and demand for Shiba Inu tokens during recent market fluctuations and growing investor interest. 



Shibariumscan also highlighted a significant 211% increase in active accounts on the platform, rising from 1,724 to 3,650.

Despite this, the number of new accounts actually declined, suggesting that the increased activity primarily came from existing users.



The recent developments pose several questions regarding the future of the Shiba Inu network. 




Observers are keen to understand how this uptick in fees might influence further activity within the ecosystem. 



Questions also arise about Shibarium’s capacity to handle continued demand without compromising on efficiency and scalability. 




Additionally, the impact of these changes on SHIB and BONE tokens is of particular interest, especially given the current instability in the broader cryptocurrency market dominated by bearish sentiment.



This scenario highlights the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets, where user behavior and technological capabilities continuously interact to shape the landscape. 



The developments in Shibarium and Shiba Inu will be closely watched as they provide insights into user engagement, technological adaptability, and market trends in the cryptocurrency space.

DeFi (decentralized finance) has been nothing short of a revolution. Its startling promise – to upend traditional financial systems and usher in an era of unprecedented accessibility, transparency and autonomy.
From humble beginnings, this new ecosystem has undergone explosive growth, now boasting a fervent global following and billions in investment.
Naturally, as the DeFi juggernaut has gained momentum, it has also drawn both the watchful eye of regulators and the attention of nefarious actors.
The U.S. SEC’s (Securities and Exchange Commission) recent decision to issue a Wells notice to Uniswap, one of the industry’s pioneering decentralized exchanges – alleging violations of securities laws – has sent shockwaves through the DeFi community.
This regulatory crackdown, coupled with a string of high-profile hacks and exploits that have drained projects of millions in funds, has cast a pall of uncertainty over the future of the sector.
In a maelstrom of innovation, regulation and security risks, the ecosystem stands at a precipice.
The decisions made and actions taken by industry leaders, developers and regulatory bodies in the coming years will shape the trajectory of the movement, determining whether it will fulfill its promise of disrupting traditional finance or succumb to the very forces it seeks to supplant.
SEC crackdown on Uniswap
In a rather zealous attempt to assert regulatory control, the SEC has set its sights on Uniswap, one of DeFi’s trailblazers.
The allegations – that it has facilitated the trading of unregistered securities, specifically tokens issued through ICOs (initial coin offerings) – paint the platform as an unregistered securities broker and exchange.
However, this narrative conveniently ignores the decentralized nature of the protocol.
While Uniswap Labs developed the front-end interface, the underlying protocol operates autonomously, without any centralized control or oversight.
This fundamental distinction seems to have escaped the SEC’s understanding.
By targeting a project like Uniswap, which has been a driving force behind the DeFi revolution, the SEC risks stifling innovation and undermining the very principles that make DeFi so revolutionary.
If the SEC’s overreach is not curtailed, the implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem could be far-reaching.
Projects that have embraced transparency and community governance may find themselves in the crosshairs, deterring further innovation and driving developers and users away from the United States.
Regulatory challenges and security vulnerabilities
As the SEC tightens its grip, DeFi platforms and protocols face a multitude of regulatory hurdles beyond the Uniswap debacle.
However, the regulatory challenges pale in comparison to the existential threat posed by the wave of hacks and exploits plaguing the ecosystem.
The inherent transparency of open-source protocols – once heralded as a strength – has become a double-edged sword, exposing vulnerabilities to nefarious actors who can meticulously dissect the code.
The staggering losses suffered by DeFi projects, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, serve as a sobering reminder of the grave consequences of security lapses.
The Munchables exploit, which saw a rogue developer abscond with over $62 million in funds, underscores the risks associated with the pseudonymous nature of DeFi development teams.
The incident highlights the overall need for more due diligence, especially around hiring personnel.
While the ethos of decentralization and immutability are noble ideals, they can hinder the ability to respond effectively to security breaches.
Calls for interventions and chain rollbacks in the wake of such incidents highlight the tension between user protection and the core principles of DeFi.
Addressing security and navigating compliance
As the DeFi ecosystem grapples with a seemingly unending barrage of hacks and exploits, stringent security measures have become an existential necessity.
The industry’s reliance on cutting-edge yet inherently complex smart contract technology has exposed vulnerabilities that can be exploited by skilled adversaries.
To chart a path toward a more secure future, DeFi projects must embrace a holistic approach to security that permeates every aspect of development and deployment.
Rigorous audits, conducted by seasoned cybersecurity professionals, must become the norm.
Penetration testing should be a continuous process, proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the industry must wholeheartedly embrace bug bounty programs, incentivizing ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses in exchange for substantial rewards.
Ultimately, the path to a secure DeFi future hinges on striking a delicate balance between innovation and risk management.
While the allure of decentralization is undeniable, its principles must be tempered by a pragmatic recognition of real-world threats that imperil user funds and erode trust in the ecosystem.
In the wake of the SEC’s crackdown, it has become increasingly evident that the industry can no longer afford to operate in a regulatory vacuum.
The commission’s actions underscore the pressing need for the DeFi ecosystem to proactively engage with regulators and collaborate on establishing industry-wide standards.
By actively participating in the regulatory discourse, DeFi pioneers have an opportunity to shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that any frameworks or guidelines imposed are tailored to the unique characteristics of DeFi.
This collaborative approach not only mitigates the risk of stifling overregulation but also enhances the legitimacy and credibility of the industry in the eyes of the public and traditional financial institutions.
Essentials for the road ahead
As the DeFi ecosystem navigates the turbulent waters of regulatory scrutiny and security breaches, it finds itself at a pivotal crossroads.
The SEC’s crackdown on Uniswap has crystallized the urgent need for DeFi projects to prioritize not only innovation but also regulatory compliance.
By proactively engaging with regulators and collaborating on the establishment of industry-wide standards, the ecosystem can shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that oversight is tailored to the unique characteristics of decentralized finance.
Yet, amid these challenges, lies a remarkable opportunity for the DeFi ecosystem to redefine the boundaries of financial innovation.
By striking a delicate balance between decentralization and user protection, transparency and oversight, the industry can harness the transformative potential of blockchain technology while safeguarding the interests of participants and fostering trust among the broader public.
The road ahead is arduous, but the rewards of success are immense.
By embracing a spirit of collaboration – both within the industry and with regulatory bodies – DeFi pioneers can catalyze a paradigm shift in finance, ushering in a new era of inclusivity, autonomy and transparency.
Ultimately, the future of DeFi hinges on the industry’s ability to navigate these challenges with resilience, foresight and an unwavering commitment to its core principles.
Only then can the true potential of this revolutionary technology be realized, empowering individuals and communities worldwide to take control of their financial destinies.

Judge Jed Rakoff orders the lawyers representing Terraform and the SEC to assemble in the court on May 22.




According to a recent Bloomberg report, Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, challenged the huge $5.3 billion penalty proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the lawsuit. Claiming that most of the firm’s stablecoins were sold overseas, the company requested the court to charge a significantly lower penalty of $1 million.



On April 5, a jury found Do Kwon liable for the collapse of the collapse of Terraform, which wiped out $40 billion in investor assets, leading to a severe crypto winter. While Kwon and Terraform were found guilty of defrauding investors regarding the sale of TerraUSD (UST), Luna (LUNA), and wLUNA, the regulators sought approximately $4.7 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest from them. In addition, the SEC charged a total of $520 million in civil penalties.









However, Terraform pleaded the court not to grant “any injunctive relief of disgorgement,”  arguing that the regulators failed to prove that it is “entitled to the expansive injunction and monetary sanctions it seeks.” Also, the platform stated that the proposed fines would have to be obtained from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), an entity not involved in the civil case. The court filing read, “.




“In conclusion, the Court should not grant any injunctive relief or disgorgement, and should impose at most a $1 million civil penalty against TFL.” 




In an April 29 filing, Judge Jed Rakoff of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered that the SEC, Kwon, and Terraform Labs’ lawyers assemble in the court on May 22 to discuss the proposed remedies.

US Fed left interest rate unchanged again, citing “lack of further progress” on 2% inflation target.
BTC remains under pressure despite a modest flip after the Fed meeting. 

Bitcoin [BTC] eased its two-day bleeding streak after the Fed meeting. As expected, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on 1st May. 
This marks the sixth Fed meeting at which the agency kept the rate at 5.25% – 5.50%. However, the Fed noted that rate cuts are not appropriate until there is greater confidence that inflation is heading to 2%. 
Part of the Fed’s policy statement read, 
“In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.”
In a later press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell was asked whether there would be three rate cuts later in the year. To which Powell responded, 
“We didn’t see progress in the first quarter; it appears then that it’s going to take longer to reach that level of confidence.” 
In a nutshell, “the higher rates for longer” stance seems officially back. 
Bitcoin saw a modest flip as memecoins led a short recovery
Within an hour after the Fed rate decision, memecoins led a slight recovery. Bonk [BONK], Floki Inu [FLOKI], and dogwifhat [WIF] recovered by 6%. 
BTC and Ethereum [ETH] recorded a modest flip within the same period. 
In the past two days, BTC has slumped hard, shedding over 12% from a high of $64.7K to a low of $56.5K. This extended BTC’s April losses into May and underscored a tough Q2.  
After the Fed statement, BTC reclaimed $58K but dropped lower a few minutes later, denoting that it was still under immense sell pressure.  
ETH also saw a modest uptick but faced rejection at the $3000 level at the time of writing. 
With the Fed’s “higher for longer” stance and negative flows from US BTC ETFs, it will be interesting to see if BTC could reclaim the range-low around $60.8K.

Aave V4 would be built on a “completely new architecture” and include a “Unified Liquidity Layer” to enable better integration of features like isolation pools, risk modules, and its native stablecoin GHO.Other proposed features are interest rates that can automatically adjust on the fly based on market conditions and using Chainlink data oracles. Also suggested were Liquidity Premiums to adjust borrowing costs based on collateral risk profiles and vaults and smart accounts for simplified user management of positions.

MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence and software company, has introduced a new decentralized identification protocol named Orange. This innovative protocol was unveiled at the annual MicroStrategy World event in Las Vegas on May 1.
Orange stands out by employing a novel method of using inscriptions as Ordinals on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to store data related to decentralized identities (DID). The protocol utilizes the Segregated Witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin. It also enables documents to be created and updated with minimal restrictions on size and content.
Why is MicroStrategy’s Orange Different from Other DID Solutions?
During a segment called “Bitcoin Security,” Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, explained the idea behind Orange protocol.

“Our vision is to provide an internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin. So, we want to use the open standard of DID, and we want to use the open standard of Bitcoin and put the two together … Why would we use Bitcoin? Well, it is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian, ” Saylor said.

Furthermore, Saylor highlighted that the protocol ensures that the decentralized identities are managed efficiently, reducing transaction fees and block space utilization—which are common concerns in blockchain operations. Yet, it is still unclear when MicroStrategy will officially launch the Orange protocol.
Based on the information on their “unofficial draft” on Github, the technological foundation of Orange is based on Bitcoin’s inscription. Orange embeds DID information directly on the blockchain, unlike other DID methods that rely on external data sources or additional dependencies. This method secures data permanence and integrity while enhancing the digital identities’ overall functionality and forward compatibility.
For instance, the Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) relies on referencing a URL to fetch DID document data. Such reliance can compromise the blockchain’s immutable nature if the URL content changes. In contrast, Orange stores additional data for the DID document directly on-chain.
Additionally, ION (did:ion) requires indexing all the IPFS data pointed to by Bitcoin transactions, which introduces more external dependencies. Orange’s use of taproot script path reveal transactions allows for storing arbitrary amounts of data in the witness of Bitcoin transactions through inscriptions. Therefore, Orange can avoid these dependencies.
Moreover, Orange enhances the security measures by distinguishing between the “wallet keys” used to sign Bitcoin transactions on-chain and the “subject keys” that authenticate the DID subject. This separation allows a third party to manage a DID on behalf of its subject or require multiple signatures. Hence, it offers an extra layer of security and control.

This move demonstrated MicroStrategy’s continuous support and involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Earlier in February, Saylor said the firm was pivoting to a Bitcoin development strategy.

“We view ourselves as a Bitcoin development company. That means we’re going to do everything we can to grow the Bitcoin network,” he said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings webinar on February 6.

MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition further solidified its long-term vision towards Bitcoin. BeInCrypto reported that MicroStrategy purchased an additional 122 BTC this April, totaling $7.8 million.
The transaction increases MicroStrategy’s holdings to 214,400 BTC, now valued at over $12.35 billion. With its holdings amount, MicroStrategy positions itself as a major player with over 1% of the finite 21 million Bitcoin supply.

However, these positive developments have not yet immediately impacted MicroStrategy’s stock price (MSTR). As of May 1, the closing price of MSTR was $1,065.03. Nevertheless, over a longer time frame, MSTR has been up about 180% this year, rising from $685.15 on January 2 to reaching its peak of $1,919.16 on March 27.

                        Two bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel, have proposed the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to address taxation issues related to block rewards earned by crypto miners. The bill aims to clarify the tax treatment of staking rewards, proposing that they should only be taxed at the time of their sale rather than upon acquisition. This move seeks to prevent double taxation and provide much-needed clarity for investors and businesses in the digital asset industry.Crypto Taxation Through Staking RewardsRepresentative Ferguson emphasized the complexity of the current tax treatment of digital asset rewards, highlighting the confusion it causes among investors and the potential for American businesses to relocate overseas due to regulatory uncertainty.“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry. The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas,” said Ferguson.The proposed legislation aims to establish clear tax guidelines for block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks, aligning taxation with the sale or spending of these rewards rather than their acquisition.The move comes in response to recent IRS rulings and the landscape of digital assets taxation. The bill seeks to provide much-needed clarity and fairness in tax treatment, ensuring that block rewards are taxed only once, at the time of their sale or exchange. This initiative reflects growing bipartisan efforts to address regulatory challenges in the digital asset space and foster innovation within the United States. Even Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the legislation “right on point” for providing adequate guidance.Stablecoin Legislation Bill Still Pending
According to a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, proposed stablecoin legislation is unlikely to be attached to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) reauthorization bill. Despite efforts by Representatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry, leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are hesitant to merge stablecoin legislation with the FAA bill, which is considered a must-pass piece of legislation.While combining the two bills would be unprecedented in financial services policy, lawmakers typically add less popular legislation to larger bills to garner bipartisan support.The Digital Chamber’s chief policy officer, Cody Carbone, expressed scepticism about the likelihood of stablecoin legislation passing before the U.S. presidential election, giving it only a 35% chance. Carbone highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding key issues such as regulatory oversight and state-level regulation, which have hindered the progress of stablecoin bills like Representative Patrick McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act.

                        Crypto-related phishing attacks have become “rampant” in South Korea, a report has claimed, with a top financial regulator set to act.Per Namdo Ilbo, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will team up with the nation’s biggest crypto exchanges to create promotional materials. The regulator wants to boost public awareness of common crypto scams.Crypto Phishing Attacks ‘Rampant’ – FSS Prepares Response
On April 29, the FSS announced plans to publish a “casebook” of case studies and “tips.” The regular said it hopes this will help citizens identify and avoid crypto-related fraud.The FSS said that the casebook contained an analysis of 2,209 reports of crypto-related phishing attacks logged from January to April.The regulator said that the reports had been processed by the nation’s Virtual Asset-related Investment Fraud Reporting Center.The data shows that chat app-based crypto “reading rooms” have become a hotbed of crypto phishing schemes.Almost 27 of all the 2,209 reports originated from these open channels, ostensibly set up as knowledge-sharing resources for South Korean crypto enthusiasts.Police have shut down multiple rings operating “reading rooms”-type scams in recent years.Fake Exchanges Target South Korean Crypto Enthusiasts
Some 19% of the cases, meanwhile, were related to “unregistered” or bogus crypto exchanges.The regulator explained that it had identified seven overarching themes in the most recent phishing report, namely:
Prompting victims to send coins to bogus crypto exchanges
Romance scams, whereby catfished victims are encouraged to “invest in crypto projects together”
Fake token lock-ups
NFT-related fraud
Scams whereby fraudsters impersonate crypto exchange employees
Scams whereby fraudsters pose as vendors of bona fide cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC)
Scams that originate on chat app-based crypto “reading rooms”
Case Studies Show Devastating Effects
The regulator’s case studies include the story of a citizen who received an Instagram direct message from an individual claiming to be a pilot based in the United States.After developing a “romantic relationship,” the “pilot” said that they had earned a considerable amount of money by investing in crypto.The “pilot” would regularly send the victim photos of luxury goods supposedly bought with these crypto trading profits.The victim then agreed to “invest” a small amount of money, which accrued a modest “profit.”Then the victim agreed to take out a bank loan worth around $217,000. They then used this money to buy cryptoassets.The “pilot” instructed the victim to send the coins to a “crypto exchange,” which turned out to be bogus.When the victim tried to “withdraw” the coins from the “exchange,” they realized that they had been duped.The FSS said that it would publish the casebook on its website and would also provide printouts to “the financially vulnerable” at senior welfare centers.The headquarters of the Financial Supervisory Service in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Wikiwater2020 [CC BY-SA 3.0])The regulator said that groups “such as the elderly” were particularly at risk. Government bodies have issued similar warnings in Japan.FSS spokespeople said they would also distribute the casebook at employment support centers and metropolitan local government centers “across the country.” An official said:“If you suspect that you have fallen victim to an investment fraud similar to the case listed in the casebook, please report this to the FSS immediately. Alternatively, please contact the police and request assistance.”The media outlet noted that the FSS was working on the project with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA).DAXA comprises the exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, all of which have permits to offer KRW trading in South Korea.And DAXA said it plans to post the casebook and educational videos on phishing protection on its members’ social media channels.Late last year, the body said it would work with financial regulators to hunt down “undeclared crypto operators.”

Avalanche’s daily memecoin transaction count hit 10k twice in March.
The memecoin frenzy subsided significantly on Avalanche, aligning with the drop in Solana’s numbers.

As the market remained awestruck by the scale of memecoin activity on networks such as Solana [SOL] and Base, another prominent layer-1 (L1) blockchain was quietly rising through the ranks.
Avalanche very much in the race
According to on-chain analyst Alex, Avalanche [AVAX] witnessed significant speculation around these community coins in the last two months.
The Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by him showed daily transaction count topping 10,000 twice in March, with substantial volumes also seen in early April.
Source: Dune Analytics
Additionally, the number of users actively participating in these transactions also surged, ripping past 4,000 on two occasions in March. Note that this was also the time when Solana was exploding with memecoin frenzy.
The most popular among the meme tokens was Coq Inu [COQ], a chicken-themed coin. It has maintained a 40%-60% share of all meme currency transactions on the network.
In fact, at the peak of the frenzy in March, it had pumped more than 4x in a span of two weeks, AMBCrypto noted using CoinMarketCap data. At press time though, the token was nursing losses.
As seen in the graph above, the frenzy subsided significantly as April progresses, which aligned with the cool-off witnessed in the case of Solana.
The Avalanche foundation, the developer of the Avalanche chain, started making strategic investments in memecoins, seeing their upside potential. Apart from COQ, some of the other coins selected for investments were Kimbo (KIMBO) and Gecko (GEC).

MicroStrategy announces the launch of MicroStrategy, a decentralized identity solution using Bitcoin blockchain.



During the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas, Michael Saylor hinted at the platform’s plan to launch the Orange protocol.



The firm envisions ensuring a secure and efficient management of digital identities through UTXOs.




MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), has recently announced the launch of MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity solution using the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform introduced MicroStrategy Orange during the Bitcoin for Corporations segment at the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas.



At the event, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor put forward an interesting question, “Wouldn’t it be great if instead of a blue check, green check, etc., there was an orange check that was a global standard?” He added that such an idea of decentralized identity with Bitcoin would be realized through MicroStrategy.







A Bitcoin proponent, Dylan LeClair, took to X to share insights on MicroStrategy’s Orange protocol. Explaining the protocol’s use of Bitcoin DID, he wrote, “The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses inscriptions in witness data to store and manage DIDs, leveraging UTXOs for DID control.”







Reportedly, MicroStrategy Orange envisions ensuring the secure and efficient management of digital identities through unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). In addition, the protocol aims to reduce transaction fees and block space.









Saylor highlighted their vision of introducing an “internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin” in a segment called Bitcoin Security. Further, he elaborated on the preference for Bitcoin over any other blockchains, stating,




“Well, it [Bitcoin] is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian.”




The news comes on the heels of MicroStrategy’s financial report of 2024 Q1, which marked a loss of $53.1 million. However, the report also revealed a gross profit of $85.2 million in the first quarter, representing a 74.0% gross margin.

MicroStrategy has announced the development of a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol, dubbed MicroStrategy Orange, adopts a Bitcoin Inscription DID method, similar to the Ordinals technique, to manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) for control. Michael Saylor, the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, unveiled the innovation at the Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.“The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses the bitcoin blockchain exclusively to store and retrieve DID information. UTXOs on chain are used to control DIDs. Inscribing data in the witness of transactions allows for greater extensibility and verbosity when creating DID documents, while reducing fees and block space consumed,” as noted in a draft of a potential specification (the document) of the new solution on MicroStrategy GitHub.According to Saylor, MicroStrategy Orange is an open-source initiative that does not rely on sidechains and is capable of processing up to 10,000 DIDs in a single Bitcoin transaction. The system aims to simplify the adoption of DIDs for organizations and individuals, offering a way to manage online identities securely and pseudonymously.“The goal of this method is to deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public bitcoin blockchain as a data source, while enabling full compatibility with the [DID-CORE] specification and forward compatibility for future extensions,” stated the document.DIDs offer a pseudonymous way to manage online identities, distinct from real-world identities, enhancing privacy. The MicroStrategy Orange suite includes the Orange Service for organizations to issue DIDs, the Orange SDK for developers, and Orange Applications like “Orange For Outlook” for digitally signing emails.The onboarding process involves an invitation from an organization, DID creation, and inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring the data is permanent and tamper-proof.According to Cezary Raczko, MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering, MicroStrategy Orange’s vision is to integrate DIDs on Bitcoin with a broader “verifiable credential ecosystem.”In other words, anyone could verify the authenticity of these credentials across various applications without relying on a central authority. The verification would happen by checking the information on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is known for its immutability and security.DIDs could be used to verify user identities on social media platforms, potentially enabling a more secure, user-controlled, and decentralized way to issue and verify credentials, Raczko highlighted a potential use case of the new protocol.

                            Dogecoin extended losses and traded below the $0.1350 resistance zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now testing an important support at $0.1200.

DOGE gained bearish momentum below the $0.140 and $0.1350 levels against the US dollar.
The price is trading below the $0.1350 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The price must settle above $0.1420 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge.

Dogecoin Price Extends Losses
After a close below $0.150, Dogecoin price extended losses and moved into a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.1350 support zone.
A low was formed at $0.1201 and DOGE is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.1250 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low.
However, the bears protected more gains above the $0.130 resistance. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1420 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.130 level.

Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com
The next major resistance is near the $0.1350 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The main hurdle is at $0.1420. A close above the $0.1420 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low might send the price toward the $0.1550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1620 level.
More Losses in DOGE?
If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1350 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1220 level.
The next major support is near the $0.120 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.120 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1040 level.
Technical Indicators
4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.1240, $0.1200 and $0.1040.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.1300, $0.1350, and $0.1420.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionDuring the Asian session, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades at $57,520, reflecting a 1.25% decrease. This movement is positioned below the pivotal $59,328 mark and suggests a cautious, bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency. This price prediction hinges on key resistance and support levels that could dictate Bitcoin price prediction.Tax Fraud Allegations Against Roger Ver, Formerly Known as “Bitcoin Jesus”
Roger Ver, an early supporter of Bitcoin and advocate for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), faces indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for allegedly evading taxes. The DOJ announced that Ver was arrested in Spain during the weekend, and the U.S. intends to request his extradition.The charges relate to actions in 2017 when Ver, having relinquished his U.S. citizenship to become a resident of St. Kitts and Nevis, is said to have sold tens of thousands of bitcoins, amassing approximately $240 million.Despite his expatriation, Ver was reportedly still required to declare his earnings and pay taxes on profits linked to U.S. entities.
Accusations: Ver is charged with failing to file tax returns and not paying taxes on capital gains from selling assets after giving up his U.S. citizenship.
Legal Requirements: Allegedly, he did not report income or taxes due on distributions from U.S. companies MemoryDealers and Agilestar.
Past Legal Troubles: Ver previously pleaded guilty and was imprisoned for selling explosives on eBay.
According to the DOJ, Ver hid from his accountant the fact that he had received and sold bitcoins from MemoryDealers and Agilestar in 2017.Consequently, his tax returns for that year did not disclose any profits or tax liabilities from these sales. Ver’s recent cryptic post on X, “Don’t expect bad people to do good things,” seems to comment on his current predicament.Simplified Explanation of the Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Update
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, continuing the same policy since July 2023. However, a significant change is on the horizon.Starting in June, the Fed plans to scale back its quantitative tightening (QT) program. This program involves selling off assets to reduce the money supply and potentially increase interest rates, aiming to control economic inflation.This adjustment caused U.S. Treasury yields, which affect things like mortgage and loan rates, to drop by 0.05 percentage points for both the 10-year and 2-year bonds.Here’s what’s important:
Background: From 2020 to 2022, the Fed bought a large amount of government bonds to lower interest rates and aid economic recovery post-pandemic.
Change in Strategy: Facing rising inflation in mid-2022, the Fed started selling these bonds. It currently allows $60 billion in Treasuries to mature monthly without renewal, pulling back money from the economy.
VIDEOJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, highlighted in his shareholder letter the unprecedented scale of QT and its potential impacts, expressing concern over draining more than $900 billion annually from the economy.The last major QT in 2019 led to a shortage of bank reserves, causing a “repo crisis” where overnight loan rates between banks surged, requiring Federal intervention to stabilize the situation. This history underscores the complex effects and potential risks of large-scale quantitative tightening.In today’s technical analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USD), dated May 2, 2024, the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,520, marking a decrease of 1.25%. Bitcoin is currently positioned below its pivot point of $59,328, suggesting a bearish outlook in the short term.The key resistance levels to watch are $61,698, followed by $64,649 and $67,065.

Worldcoin, the ambitious crypto project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is expanding its footprint into Latin America. The project marked its recent move into Mexico, yet simultaneously facing regulatory challenges in Argentina.
The contrasting dynamics of Worldcoin in Latin America show the intricate balance between innovative tech growth and the need for robust data protection laws. In today’s digital era, achieving such balance is essential.
Worldcoin’s Expansion Sparks Debate on Data Protection in Latin America
In a Monday post on its official X account, Worldcoin announced that it is expanding to Mexico. Local media reported that Worldcoin has launched operations in nine different Mexico locations. This expansion makes Mexico the third-largest Latin American market for Worldcoin, trailing only behind Argentina and Chile regarding user engagement.
Despite the enthusiasm, Worldcoin’s venture in Latin America has sparked concerns among local officials in Mexico. María Eugenia Hernández, a Congressional representative from the Morena party, is one of the lawmakers who expressed her worries. On April 15, Hernández called for a thorough review of Worldcoin’s data protection practices by the National Transparency Institute (INAI).

Meanwhile, in Argentina, the reaction has been more stringent. Carlos Puglelli, a provincial deputy in Buenos Aires, has introduced legislation to regulate companies that collect biometric data through methods like iris scanning. Puglelli’s proposal seeks to establish a clear legal framework that ensures transparency, fairness, and the protection of consumer rights in digital transactions.

“It is essential to adapt our legislation to the challenges posed by the digital age. This law seeks to protect the rights of consumers and users in an increasingly digitalized environment, ensuring the privacy and security of their data,” Puglelli pointed out.


Puglelli’s legislative efforts also include creating a Provincial Registry of Digital Applications of Biometric Data to oversee and control the activities of technology companies operating in this space. This registry is part of a broader attempt to foster a safer digital environment for consumers. Therefore, it will ensure the careful handling of users’ personal information and that it is not subject to unfair contractual terms.
The legal text proposed by Puglelli mandates that any processing of personal data must be based on the users’ free, express, and informed consent. Moreover, digital application providers must adopt adequate security measures like information encryption and access controls to safeguard user data. Violations of these provisions also could lead to hefty fines and even the revocation of business permits.
His initiative followed accusations against Worldcoin for incorporating allegedly abusive clauses in their contracts. BeInCrypto reported that the Buenos Aires government prompted a $1.2 million fine for the project.
On the international front, Latin America’s expansion and regulatory responses echo global concerns about Worldcoin. Jurisdictions in Kenya and Spain have taken even more decisive actions, temporarily suspending the project’s operations amid privacy concerns.

                        The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have witnessed record net outflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experiencing its first-ever day of outflows. On May 1, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund saw $36.9 million flow out, according to data from Farside Investors. In addition, nine other Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded outflows of $526.8 million, with the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) being the only one to report zero flows, as per preliminary Farside Investors data.Fidelity Records Largest Daily Outflow
Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) experienced the largest outflow for the day, with $191.1 million net outflows.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed closely behind, with an outflow of $167.4 million. This marks the highest single-day outflow for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeing outflows of $98.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. These outflows coincide with a 10.7% decrease in the price of Bitcoin over the past week.Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, highlighted that the iShares Gold ETF and SPDR Gold ETFs have experienced outflows of $1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, so far this year. Interestingly, despite these outflows, gold has shown a 16% increase year-to-date, as pointed out by Geraci in a recent post.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, emphasized that the Bitcoin ETFs are still operating smoothly overall, with inflows and outflows being a normal occurrence in the life of an ETF. “Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he wrote on X. Bitcoin Posts Worst Month Since FTX Collapse
Bitcoin has experienced its most challenging month since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire, as the excitement surrounding US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to wane. The cryptocurrency’s value plummeted by nearly 16% in April, only slightly better than the decline witnessed in November 2022.The surge in demand fueled by the anticipation of ETFs propelled Bitcoin to an all-time high of almost $74,000 in March. However, as optimism for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts waned and risky investments lost their allure, inflows to these products significantly decreased.The stocks of crypto mining companies suffered more significant declines than Bitcoin itself. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Platforms Inc., Cleanspark Inc., and Cipher Mining Inc. experienced drops ranging from 7.9% to 11%. MicroStrategy Inc., known for its corporate Bitcoin strategy, also faced an 18% tumble after reporting a first-quarter loss of $53 million due to an impairment charge against the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

Crypto firms were listed alongside retail banking, wholesale banking, and wealth management companies.Crypto-asset firms remain vulnerable to being exploited for money laundering. Source: FCAThe report showed between 2022 and 2023, there were a total of 52.8 full-time specialist employees overseeing Anti-Money Laundering cases, with nearly one-third focused specifically on supervising crypto firms. During the 2022 to 2023 period, the FCA’s financial crime specialists conducted a total of 231 reviews of financial firms operating in the U.K. as well as an additional 375 cases related to financial crimes and sanctions.

On April 26, The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) and police received expanded authority to “seize, freeze, and destroy” cryptocurrency used by criminals. Under the new rules, police in the country will no longer be required to make an arrest before seizing crypto holdings.U.K. law enforcement can now seize items like passwords and memory sticks that could aid investigations. They have also been granted power to remove crypto assets from being returned into circulation — typically by burning the asset — if it were to be deemed detrimental to the public good.Under the new laws, U.K. police can transfer seized illicit cryptocurrency to wallets under their control, and crime victims can apply to reclaim funds from their crypto accounts.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

                        Hong Kong’s ZA Bank, a unit of China’s ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance, is reportedly exploring ways to offer virtual asset-related services after new regulations for digital assets launch in June.To establish itself as a crypto hub, Hong Kong implemented a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges last year. This required all exchanges operating within the city to submit applications for licenses by Feb. 2024. The competition is fierce, with 24 companies vying for these coveted licenses.Approval from Hong Kong’s top financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), is highly sought-after, due to its reputation as a prestigious regulatory body.Leveraging this interest, ZA Bank CEO Ronald Iu Man-chung told SCMP in a recent interview that the bank is actively preparing to launch virtual asset trading services for retail investors. However, specific details will be announced only after they finalize preparations, he said.ZA Bank didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Hong Kong Cracks Down on Unlicensed Virtual Asset Exchanges
The bank’s foray into crypto comes amid a stricter regulatory landscape in Hong Kong. In February, the city’s securities watchdog, the SFC, issued a warning to crypto investors. It urged them to only use licensed platforms and to double-check the registration status of their chosen exchanges.This warning coincides with a critical deadline for Hong Kong-based crypto exchanges. They had until Feb. 29 to submit license applications, or face closure by May 31. The SFC website reinforces this point with a clear message: unlicensed exchanges must cease operations by the end of May.Hong Kong Reboots Crypto Ambitions with ETFs, Regulatory Reform
The SFC has also advised investors to move their digital assets to platforms that are already regulated or in the process of obtaining a license. Currently, only OSL Digital Securities and Hash Blockchain hold licenses for virtual asset trading in Hong Kong. However, there are 24 applicants vying for approval, including names like OKX, HKVAX, Bybit, and DFX Labs.The SFC will also reveal a list of approved and rejected applications for virtual asset trading platforms on a public registry by June 1, 2024.The regulator also recently greenlit Asia’s first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly tied to Bitcoin and Ether. These ETFs began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday.Hong Kong’s crypto standing took a hit in mid-2022 due to a lack of clear regulations and the rise of competitor hubs like Singapore and Dubai, known for their crypto-friendly stance. However, the city is making a comeback.ZA Bank’s Ronald Iu, highlights the bank’s commitment to supporting the digital asset sector, including Web3 startups, as Hong Kong ramps up digital asset trading through its new licensing program. This program, along with the lifting of the retail crypto trading ban in 2023, signals Hong Kong’s renewed push to become a major crypto hub.

								The director of marketing at blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Brian Quinlivan, is listing two developments that could ignite a recovery in the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Quinlivan says in a new video that accumulation by whales and sharks (those holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC) as well as widespread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) among crypto traders and investors could inspire an upward trend for Bitcoin.










“Since the beginning of the month [of April], these last four-ish weeks or so we’re looking at the whales and sharks actually taking some profit and the price is seemingly following them. 
And until they start to turn it around and resume their accumulation, there can be an argument that we will continue to slide very slowly until either the crowd gets really, really fearful. Like November 2022 was with the FTX [crypto exchange] collapse or the whales just decide ‘you know what, prices are low enough. I’m going to start pumping those prices again.’”
According to Quinlivan, the stock and crypto markets are currently enjoying a directly proportional relationship.
“There is a pretty big correlation right now between crypto and the S&amp;P [500 index]…
The way the Federal Reserve is, the way the inflationary policies have been here in the US at least the last few years have had just a massive kind of impact on the rest of the markets. So until that changes, we have to be conscious of the fact that the way the US stock market has been going lately has had an impact on the way crypto goes. 
And it might be emphasizing a greater drop than crypto otherwise would be seeing on its own if the S&amp;P was stable right now. So that could actually be a positive argument indicating that if the S&amp;P starts to recover, then crypto might see a bit of a relief rebound of its own.”

Senate Bill 78 imposes noise limits on crypto mining farms, regulates water use for cooling, prohibits mining operations from being owned by foreign entities and restores local government control over their regulation. Senate Bill 79 creates a state licensing and regulatory system overseen by the Oil and Gas Commission under the Department of Energy and Environment.The two bills are now headed to Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk, which her office has said she will sign into law, the Associated Press reported.The two bills will amend the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023, which quickly passed in the Arkansas legislature and provided some protections to mining sites.The act was heavily debated in April when the two bills were initially submitted, as it severely limited the ability of local governments to regulate crypto-mining operations, leading to outrage and complaints from impacted rural communities.Local outlet the Arkansas Advocate reported Representative Jeremiah Moore, the sponsor of Bill 79, said the state has an emerging mining industry, adding, “We’ve never seen anything quite like this in our state before.”Related: Bill protecting Bitcoin mining rights passes in Arkansas Senate and HouseSanders’ spokesperson told the Arkansas Advocate the governor “strongly supports outlawing foreign adversaries from owning crypto mines in Arkansas while protecting rural communities and empowering them to crack down on bad actors.” Crypto mining in the United States has become a significant point of contention. In April, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden took a tougher stance against mining operations, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises

In a recent report, VanEck, a well-known investment management firm, revealed that approximately $175 billion worth of Bitcoin is currently held in various ETFs, nations, and public and private companies that purchase BTC.
The report highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Hedge funds, asset management firms, and foundations are increasingly recognizing BTC's potential as a store of value.


According to CoinGecko's data, this $175 billion investment accounts for approximately 15% of the entire Bitcoin supply. As of last Wednesday, BTC's total market cap was approximately $1.2 trillion.

VanEck, which launched a spot BTC ETF that began trading in January, also noted in its report that more merchants and businesses are now accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.





The firm explained that the infrastructure is being built to make it easier for the average person to use BTC, making a strong case for why Bitcoin is a solid investment.

</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:04 </pubDate></item><item><title>Synethix founder Kain Warwick targets mid-May launch for Infinex DEX</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/synethix-kain-warwick-targets-mid-may-infinex-dex-launch</link><description>Synethix founder Kain Warwick has given a date for when the decentralized exchange front-end and self-custodial account system Infinex is set to go live after several delays from its expected Q4 2022 launch. Infinex is targeting an official launch on May 13, Warwick said on May 2 at the ETH Global conference in Sydney, Australia.Warwick said May 13 would mark the launch of the Infinex Account, which is described by the Infinex team as a "collection of cross-chain smart contracts that can be controlled, secured and recovered" by way of  Web2 authentication such as an email address login. Source: InfinexWarwick said that Infinex — which began as a decentralized front-end to access Synthetix liquidity and trading features — had evolved to become a more broad-scale platform aimed at reducing the barriers that prevented people from onboarding into DeFi. “There’s no denying that within DeFi or just on-chain generally that there's a lot more stuff to do. From a product perspective, or feature perspective, we have more features on chain than you could really replicate in a centralized exchange.” Despite there being a greater diversity of applications on-chain, Warwick noted that crypto users were still utilizing centralized exchanges for crypto-related financial activity by a “significant margin.” He explained despite the flaws of centralized exchanges being surfaced by events such as the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, crypto investors still didn’t make the leap into DeFi and instead opted to move to competitor exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.Kain Warwick speaking at Pragma SydneyFor Warwick, the barriers preventing users from onboarding into DeFi couldn't be traced back solely to products nor did it fall back to promises of increased safety. Instead, these onboarding issues were primarily rooted in issues with user experience. He explained that Infinex would function as the "UX layer," offering a more centralized exchange-like interface for users to engage with decentralized applications on a range of blockchain networks including,Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Solana. “It’s a really hard thing to do well, but I think we are at least getting pretty close on the Infinex side.”Warwick added that Infinex would utilize social passkeys to enable users to log in via Web2 applications — such as a Google account — and reduce the “friction” that typically accompanies a standard Web3 user experience. “The core component is you will have an account that you will own — it’s self-custodial — but you will be able to effectively login to that account via Web2,” Warwick said. “The starting point of [Infinex] you can have an account, and then you can deposit into that account to earn governance points,” said Warwick. He added there would be a points-farming game that would run for the month following the launch. On March 13, Infinex suffered a security breach which saw Warwick quickly take over as head of the project’s working group.Source: InfinexSpeaking to Cointelegraph Warwick said the security vulnerability was “part of the reason” Infinex’s launch — initially targeted for Q4 2023 — was delayed. The security vulnerability was a social engineering attack that saw hacker gain access to a password vault, Warwick said. From there, they were then able to get into the protocol’s DNS store and modify Infinex’s DNS. Related: Synthetix DEX launch to join efforts reducing the ‘serious friction’ in DeFi“There were no funds at risk because we weren’t live — but just from learning a lesson sort of thing — even prior to being live, that just shouldn’t be able to happen,” he said. “I came in and I brought a couple of other people in and we burned all of the systems to the ground and rebuilt everything from scratch.

We do think there’s a solid 10,000 [genuine] users on that list,” he said. “If we have 5,000 to 10,000 people and 50 million of TVL — I feel like we’ve done something right.”Warwick added that if the current market cycle were to remain bullish he expects to see “hundreds of thousands” of users join Infinex within a year of its launch.

																Bitcoin prices slumped to a nine-week low just below $57,000 on May 1, shedding a further 4% on the day. The asset has now bled a whopping 11% since the same time last week.
Market dips and flush-outs are not uncommon for crypto assets, but Glassnode analyst James Check thinks this time is different.
Large derivatives-led deleveraging events were a big feature in the 2021 bull market and have been seen on several occasions this year, the last one in mid-April.
However, Check observed that they did not cause this week’s crypto crash in a post to X on May 2.
Derivatives Not The Cause
“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see,” he said before adding:
“It suggests we didn’t see a massive futures margin call yesterday.”
Funding rates are fees set by derivatives exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price.






The analyst produced another chart showing that Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has declined over the last year in BTC terms.
“This compares OI to market size and shows a relative leverage reduction,” he added.
Open Interest is the number of outstanding crypto derivatives contracts that have yet to be settled.
Check acknowledged that futures markets also saw two significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off but added, “Again, it doesn’t feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”
“Rather than a derivatives-led sell-off, I believe this is primarily spot-driven weakness, a result of both short-term sell-side and weaker demand.”
According to Deribit, there is around $1.3 billion in OI for Friday’s Bitcoin options expiry event showing that demand for derivatives remains healthy.
Crypto Markets Bleed
Total market capitalization has declined by over $240 billion over the past week, falling to $2.26 trillion during Thursday morning trading in Asia.
The wider market has shrunk by 22% since its 2024 peak level of around $2.9 trillion.
Technical analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ was unfazed, stating that markets have entered a historically recurring re-accumulation phase.


BTC was trading at $57,469 at the time of writing, while ETH had slumped 2% to $2,920. The altcoins were a mixed bag today, but Binance Coin (BNB) and Toncoin (TON) were seeing larger losses.

                        The UK’s financial watchdog dedicated nearly a third (30%) of its financial crime specialists to overseeing crypto asset businesses in 2023, according to a report released on May 1.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it conducted risk assessments across various sectors and identified retail banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, and crypto-asset firms as especially susceptible to financial crime in 2023. These sectors were deemed the most at risk of being misused for money laundering activities.In its fight against financial crime, the FCA’s team of specialists conducted a significant number of reviews. This included 231 in-depth analyses (desk-based reviews) and seven on-site visits. Additionally, other supervisory teams within the FCA identified 375 potential cases, with 95 specifically linked to crypto assets.Also, the regulator extended a key survey – called REP CRIM – to crypto businesses in April 2022. This comprehensive survey gathers information on anti-money laundering (AML) controls implemented by these firms.Data obtained through REP-CRIM, along with other intelligence reports, allows the regulator to pinpoint risks more effectively and tailor their supervisory actions accordingly.UK Crypto Firms Face Uphill Battle as FCA Registration Process Weeds Out Many
Since Jan. 2020, the FCA has been the AML watchdog for UK crypto businesses like exchanges and custodians. It implemented a rigorous evaluation process for new registrations, uncovering major shortcomings in firms’ anti-money laundering controls. This resulted in many applications being withdrawn, rejected, or refused by the FCA.The FCA’s March business plan highlights its commitment to consumer protection and ensuring a fair crypto market. This includes a focus on strengthening its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Additionally, the FCA aims to promote a competitive UK financial sector within the global landscape.FCA Cracks Down on Misleading Ads
Since intensifying its oversight of financial promotions, the watchdog removed a higher number of misleading advertisements last year compared to 2022.This increased scrutiny follows stricter advertising rules for high-risk investments, implemented in July 2023. These rules include specific guidelines for companies to disclose critical information about crypto products across various online platforms.Further tightening its grip, the FCA issued new guidelines in March this year, targeting financial promotions on social media. This applies to formats like memes, reels, and even gaming streams. The focus is on ensuring fair and accurate information, with no room for misleading content.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced its first-ever outflow day, with $36.9 million leaving the fund on May 1. 
This notable outflow broke a 77-day streak of stable or positive net flows, raising eyebrows among investors and analysts alike.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Record Outflows
This shift comes at a time when the broader US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also witnessed record net outflows. The outflows sum up to $563.7 million across various funds on May 1. 
Among these, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) reported the largest single-day loss with $191.1 million, followed closely by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $167.4 million exit its coffers.

Despite these significant movements, experts like James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, reassure investors.

“These ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” Seyffart said.

Additionally, cryptocurrency enthusiasts continue to debate the impact of ETF flows on Bitcoin’s price. Coosh Alemzadeh, a noted Bitcoin investor, argues that the influence of Bitcoin ETFs on market trends is overstated. 

“Bitcoin ETFs are more of a narrative IMO and have less impact on trend than people think.Solana has had “zero” ETF flows and yet has outperformed Bitcoin,” Alemzadeh wrote.


The outflows from ETFs coincided with a dip in Bitcoin’s price, which fell below $57,000 for the first time since February. BeInCrypto reported that this downturn is due to a decrease in demand among crypto whales and spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
The current price of Bitcoin is situated below the short-term holders’ realized price, which lies around $63,000. Traders use this metric to gauge the cost basis of short-term holders’ purchases.
On-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin’s price might soon find a floor. 

“The $55,000 to $57,000 level is 10% below the current realized price of short-term holders, which has historically acted as the ultimate support during bull markets,” the firm explained.

Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crazy Wolf (CRAWOLF), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crazy Wolf presents a similar opportunity.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,300% in the coming two days, and Crazy Wolf could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Crazy Wolf can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Crazy Wolf on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crazy Wolf by entering its contract address – 4cra6VGCDowfFz3HDz5ctXtCSAhQQ5FEscKMLGzB56ML – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRAWOLF.

Dalpour is alleged to have fabricated contracts, falsified bank statements, and fictitious email correspondence to hoodwink investors into believing in the viability of the ventures. Related: DOJ challenges motion to dismiss Tornado Cash co-founder’s chargesThe FBI says that the investor funds were instead siphoned off to fulfill earlier investors' returns, finance personal expenses — including exorbitant gambling losses — and cover private school tuition for Dalpour's children.James Smith, the assistant director of the FBI, said:“Today’s arrest illustrates the FBI’s dedication to maintaining economic justice and ensuring the actions of one individual are not at the expense of others.”The unraveling of Dalpour's scheme came about when a group of victims confronted him in November 2023. Dalpour then confessed and acknowledged the gravity of his actions, stating, "[w]hat you already have, you have, you can put me in jail now. Like right now."This is one of multiple Ponzi scheme-related arrests with ties to crypto made by U.S. officials in the last year. On March 15, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) busted a $300 million Ponzi scheme under the guise of a crypto trading platform called CryptoFX, which targeted crypto investors from the Latino community in the U.S. and two foreign countries.A few days later, on March 18, a New York jury convicted two individuals who acted as promoters for the now-collapsed fake crypto mining and trading scheme IcomTech.Most recently, on April 4, Irina Dilkinska, the former head of legal and compliance for the multibillion-dollar OneCoin fraud scheme, received a four-year jail sentence after admitting to her role in laundering millions of dollars.

The clarification comes after the platform experienced a $1.6 million exploit on April 30.On May 1, Pike published an announcement saying that the exploit was related to a vulnerability on USDC and that USDC’s product offerings had nothing to do with the security lapse that the network suffered.  “This exploit is related to the initial USDC vulnerability that was reported last week on the 26th of April.”However, the DeFi protocol quickly retracted the statement, explaining that the phrase they used did not accurately describe the exploit that transpired. Source: Pike Finance Pike highlighted that the exploit was caused by lapses in its security measures in its contract functions when handling transfers with the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a service provided by USDC-issuer Circle. Pike clarified that the root cause of the exploit is unrelated to the functionality of Circle’s product offerings.In a previous announcement, Pike Finance said that its auditing partner had already discovered the vulnerability that caused the first hack on April 26, but their team could not address it. They wrote: “It is important to clarify that this vulnerability was previously identified by our auditing partner, OtterSec. Our developer team was unable to address the identified vulnerability in a timely manner.”Pike noted that the exploit resulted from their team’s “improper integration” of third-party technologies like the CCTP or Gelato Network’s automation services. The initial attack led to the theft of $300,000 worth of digital assets. Related: April sees $25M in exploits and scams, marking historic low ― CertiKOn April 30, an attacker used a vulnerability in the protocol’s smart contract to drain about $1.68 million across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. In total, the attacker took $1.4 million in Ether (ETH), $150,000 in Optimism (OP) and about $100,000 in Arbitrum (ARB) tokens. Pike recognized that both attacks were due to the same smart contract vulnerability. The protocol said that the misalignment in the contract eventually allowed the attackers to bypass admin access and withdraw funds. Even though hacks still plague the crypto space, data shows that losses in crypto-related hacks showed a sharp decline in April compared to February and March. On May 1, PeckShield reported that losses from hacks in April dropped to $60 million, a steep jump from February’s $360.8 million and March’s $187.6 million.Magazine: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch: Web3 Gamer

So everyone is quick to jump on a narrative.”Patricia came under scrutiny following a hacking incident in May 2023, which led to a significant loss of customer funds. Despite claims that customer funds were secure, users have encountered persistent challenges accessing them since April 2023. This lack of access to users’ funds fueled speculation about concerns regarding a potential exit scam, raising fears for customers with funds stuck on the platform.In a recent post on X, Hanu claimed that despite providing interviews and sharing information with media outlets, they twisted the narrative to garner more attention and align with their own agenda.Source: Hanu FejiroIn response to customer requests, Patricia converted the value of customer assets into its native Patricia Token (PTK) in October 2023, guaranteeing future repayment. Patricia highlighted its commitment to integrity and customer trust, introducing PTK as an internal customer asset.Patricia stated it is committed to reimbursing holders with 1 Tether (USDT) token for each Patricia token, ensuring asset recovery after the security breach. Patricia clarified that PTK is not on-chain but serves as an internal token representing debt and is managed by the company.Related: Losses from crypto hacks plunge 67% in April to $60 millionIn the X post, Hanu updated users on Patricia’s status and assured them that Nigerian security services are dealing with the case.

According to the SEC, they have been involved with fraud involving more than $4 billion from unregistered token sales. One of the main types of coins is the cryptocurrency tokens LUNA and UST.UST, an algorithmically issued coin, no longer held its peg to the US dollar, causing the market price to plummet by approximately $40 billion in 2022. Terraform’s legal team, however, has refuted the charges shown by the SEC in general agreement with the penalty sum of about $5.3 billion.Terraform argues against $5.3 billion fineThe height of the conflict came when the jury in New York ruled on April 5, 2024, that both Terraform and Kwon were in the wrong for committing fraud. The last day of the two-week trial ended with a judgment that could bring notable punishment to the cryptocurrency sector. Nevertheless, Terraform’s lawyers believe that most of the UST stablecoin sales took place in countries other than the US. They argue that the SEC hasn’t provided strong enough evidence that there is a link between Terraform’s small operations in the U.S. and the big financial losses indicated.After the sentence, the SEC demands for financial measures, arguing that it will serve as a template for the business. As stated, the commission urged concrete and effective words around explicit wrong conduct in the cryptocurrency field. On the other hand, Terraform lawyers are at least arguing that the penalty is too high and nothing deserves to be deserved, saying that proper financial compensation for clients may be around $1 million.Meanwhile, Terraform’s defense is dependent on the international spread of its business activity. On May 1, 2024, Terraform’s attorneys filed a response arguing the SEC’s lack of authority and insufficient evidence. They argued overwhelmingly that most transactions didn’t occur within U.S. territories, and they deserved no such huge fines under U.S. jurisdiction.Moreover, the defense lawyers justified that position because everything was done in Korea and Singapore. He contended that his role in the allied operations would be the one with the minimum predictable influence on the U.S. operations. In a different filing, Terraform leaped to check the SEC’s narrative by querying whether it was correct. The firm’s legal representatives criticized the SEC’s lack of evidence linking suspected ones to the large scale of losses that the SEC claimed.Grewal highlights compliance in the crypto sectorThe SEC, via its Enforcement Division chairman, Gurbir Grewal, has enjoyed the court’s ruling. Grewal echoed the need for compliance in the crypto industry and just as well referred to the devastating investor losses highlighted in the case of the immediate past. He contended that the decision represents a crucial point for the creator of the regulatory regime targeted on rewarding those who move along the line with the general social good and discouraging the other bad-intentioned actors.This judicial case signifies not only the careful research and precautions applied to the cryptocurrency industry in the US but also an increasing display of due attention and cautious regulations. If the retrial concludes with a ruling that has not yet been decided, the final verdict is expected to shape not only the future of Terraform Labs and its operations but also how other crypto companies will interact with and seek to comply with the regulatory regime, particularly as far as crypto firms’ international operations are concerned.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price was noted to have a considerable drawdown in the last three days, which brought BTC below $58,000. While many consider this to be the beginning of the bear market, it is simply a cool-down.
The mid to long-term outlook for the digital asset is still bullish and Bitcoin will likely validate this in the coming weeks.
Bitcoin Investors Are Still Focused on HODLing
Bitcoin’s price took a hit over the past 48 hours after exhibiting consolidation for the past couple of weeks. The drawdown across the crypto market wiped out nearly $600 million in two days, spooking investors. 
However, looking at BTC on-chain metrics, it seems that this decline was expected, and it is nothing but a short pause in the long-term rally. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) over a period of 90 days shows that long-term holders (LTHs) are largely anticipating a further run-up in Bitcoin’s price.

Low levels of CDD recorded mean investors are more likely to either accumulate or be less eager to spend their holdings due to the lower Bitcoin price. This reinforces optimism toward recovery, confirming the recent correction to be merely a market cool-down and not the beginning of a bear market.

Further substantiating this is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio gauges investor profit or loss. With Bitcoin’s 90-day MVRV at -9.5%, indicating losses, it is likely investors will hold off selling or move to accumulate BTC.
Historically, recovery happens within the -8% to -21% MVRV range, which often precedes rallies. Thus, this zone has been dubbed an accumulation opportunity zone.
If BTC holders act accordingly, Bitcoin’s price could soon see a recovery.

BTC Price Prediction: Bullish Flag Persists
Bitcoin’s price trading at $57,444 is reeling from the drawdown that pulled BTC below $60,000. However, the digital asset is still above the lower trend line of the flag that BTC has been moving in for the past two months.
The flag pattern is characterized by a sharp price movement followed by a consolidation period in the form of a rectangular flag. The breakout from the flag pattern indicates the continuation of the uptrend.
The target for Bitcoin’s price based on the pattern is still $92,505, which would mark a 45% rally above the breakout point. However, the more practical target is a rally above $73,700 to push BTC toward a new all-time high.

This would require Bitcoin’s price to flip the $71,800 resistance into a support floor by first breaching the $68,500 barrier.
However, if BTC holders move to offset their losses and sell their holdings, the cryptocurrency could fall through the lower trend line. This would result in Bitcoin’s price falling below $52,000, effectively invalidating the bullish outlook.

                            In an analysis shared via X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez elaborated on the ongoing price correction of Dogecoin (DOGE), positing that it is a consistent precursor to major bull runs, drawing on historical patterns to forecast future price movements.
Martinez’s commentary centers on the chart pattern known as the “descending triangle.” This is a bearish formation that occurs when the price follows a downward trendline intersecting a flat support line. Typically, this pattern indicates a continuation of a downward trend, but in the context of Dogecoin, Martinez suggests it precedes significant bullish breakouts.
“The ongoing Dogecoin price correction is part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs! Let’s dive in,” Martinez shared. He explained the historical significance of this pattern in Dogecoin’s trading history: “In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Then, DOGE retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run!”

Martinez further analyzed more recent cycles to reinforce his observations, “In 2021, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle again. Then, DOGE retraced by 56% before skyrocketing by 12,197%!” According to Martinez, these retracements are not random but are characteristic of how Dogecoin has behaved in previous cycles, setting the stage for explosive gains.
The analyst drew parallels to the current market conditions: “Now, in 2024, DOGE has yet again broken out of a descending triangle! It is currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run!” This assertion suggests that the current market downturn might be an opportune buying moment ahead of potential gains.

Martinez’s analysis underscores the cyclical nature of Dogecoin’s price movements, suggesting a pattern of sharp declines followed by dramatic recoveries. “Over the years, Dogecoin appears to mirror its previous bull cycles! All you need is a little bit of patience,” he concluded.
Short-Term Dogecoin Price Analysis
Amidst this optimistic prediction, the Dogecoin price is in a precarious scenario in the short-term. Since mid-April, DOGE has experienced significant technical resistance. Particularly, the DOGE price was consistently rejected at the 50-day EMA over multiple instances, indicating strong selling pressure at higher price levels.

Amid a broader market downturn, the trajectory was accentuated when Dogecoin’s price broke below the crucial 100-day EMA. This level, often watched by traders for signs of medium-term market direction, had previously offered support. The breach underscores a weakening market sentiment and could signal extended losses.

As of press time, Dogecoin’s price hovered near $0.1259 after narrowly holding above the 200-day EMA yesterday, a key psychological and technical barrier. This moving average is now a pivotal point for Dogecoin; its sustained breach on the daily chart could significantly alter the market structure, potentially triggering a slide towards the $0.1005 support level.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.63, edging close to the oversold territory but not conclusively signaling an imminent reversal. This indicates that while the market is nearing oversold conditions, the selling pressure has not fully abated. One last leg down might be necessary to get DOGE into “oversold” territory in order to mark a local bottom.

Prominent blockchain sleuth Whale Alert, which tracks down large cryptocurrency transfers, has spread the word about almost two trillion Shiba Inu meme coins leaving Robinhood for an unknown wallet.Two staggering SHIB chunks were grabbed on the popular investment platform and withdrawn approximately eight hours ago. In the meantime, SHIB is eyeing a bullish breakout, according to a popular analyst. In the meantime, almost two billion SHIB were burned in April - mostly by mistake.1.75 trillion SHIB purchased as coin eyes breakoutThe aforementioned source shared that over the past eight hours, mysterious wallet -4D935 has scooped up two enormous chunks containing 875,000,000,000 SHIB each. That is 1.75 trillion SHIB meme coins in total evaluated at $39.2 billion at the time the transactions were made. In the meantime, popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez tweeted on Wednesday that he has spotted the second largest meme coin, SHIB, forming a bull flag on the daily trading chart.He predicts that SHIB is aiming to make a major bullish breakout to the $0.000072323 level and is placing a few buy orders around $0.000018343 price mark.Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has attempted to surge by more than 9%, reaching $0.00002314. However, a decline that followed took it back to $0.000002182 - that is, down 5.68%.1.6 billion SHIB scorched in past month, here's nuanceAccording to a recent tweet published by the Shibburn explorer, in April, the Shiba Inu community did an impressive job of reducing the total circulating SHIB supply as it burned a whopping 1,695,717,536 SHIB.That achievement was made thanks to 204 transactions that locked all those meme coins in unspendable blockchain wallets. However, Shibburn clarified that all these burns were not quite the usual ones. All of these tokens were lost forever due to investors sending them to the contract address by mistake.These people have lost their investment, Shibburn emphasized in the tweet, urging the cryptocurrency community to be watchful and double-check the destination wallets before transacting. As for fresh daily burns, within the last 24 hours, the SHIB army has been unable to hold the SHIB burn rate in the green (-11.80%), with 2,027,495 meme coins destroyed.

Gold Bull Peter Schiff Spots Bearish Technical Pattern As BTC Drops Below $60K - Benzinga</title><link>https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38573665/bitcoin-selloff-just-getting-started-gold-bull-peter-schiff-spots-bearish-technical?utm_source=cryptopanic.com&amp;utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site</link><description>Bitcoin BTC/USD has been on a downward trajectory since its peak in mid-March, with the decline accelerating in late April. Crypto skeptic and economist Peter Schiff believes the sell-off could continue.Technical Analysis: On Wednesday, Schiff shared a short-term candlestick chart of Bitcoin on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting a technical pattern suggesting a potential bearish trend. He pointed out that the previous support level of $60,000 is now acting as resistance. Additionally, he identified a possible “head-and-shoulders” pattern forming under $60,000, with a neckline around $57,000. This pattern, if confirmed, could indicate a bearish reversal.“The downside objective is $54K,” he posted.Understanding Head-And-Shoulders: A head-and-shoulders pattern is a technical indicator used to identify potential trend reversals. It consists of three peaks: a middle peak (the “head”) that is higher than the two outer peaks (the “shoulders”). A confirmed head-and-shoulders pattern suggests that an upward trend is nearing its end and a downward trend may begin.See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC)Why It Matters: Bitcoin enjoyed a significant rally following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in late 2021. After a period of consolidation, the price surged to an all-time high of $73,750.07 on March 14th. Since then, it has been in a broad consolidation phase, with a recent downward trend emerging.Federal Reserve Decision: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates impacted Bitcoin’s price. The pause in rate hikes strengthened the U.S. dollar, which weakened Bitcoin as it is denominated in dollars. Conversely, future signs of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could translate to Bitcoin gaining strength.Diverging Opinions: While detractors like Schiff take a bearish stance on Bitcoin’s short-term outlook, proponents remain optimistic. Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood predicts a long-term price surge, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $3.8 million by 2030. In the face of this uncertainty, some analysts, like Ali Martinez, see an opportunity to buy the current dip.Price Action: Bitcoin was trading 4% down at $57,630 at around 3 am ET, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin Tops Returns In All Asset Classes Amid ‘Repeatedly Disappointing Inflation Data’: Mohamed El-Erian Shares Insights On Market VolatilityImage via Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:10 </pubDate></item><item><title>The US Senator Cynthia Lummis supports Bitcoin regulation</title><link>https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/02/the-us-senator-cynthia-lummis-supports-a-fair-regulation-for-bitcoin-and-decentralized-finance/</link><description>Recently, US Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed significant concerns about what she perceives as the aggressive attitude of the Biden administration towards regulating Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi). 

Bitcoin and crypto regulation: an important ally in the US Senate
As a strong supporter of digital assets and blockchain technology, Senator Lummis has positioned herself as a key ally for the cryptocurrency community, emphasizing the importance of individual rights in managing digital assets.
Senator Lummis, representative of Wyoming, a state known for its crypto-friendly legislation, criticized the current administration for its approach to regulating the cryptocurrency sector.
His observations highlight a growing tension between federal regulatory efforts and the emerging digital finance industry, which promotes decentralization and minimal regulatory interference.
The Biden administration has been increasingly vocal about the need for a strict regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in order to protect consumers, ensure national security, and maintain financial stability. 
This perspective aligns with global trends in which governments seek to limit the financial risks associated with digital assets, including fraud, volatility, and the potential for use in illicit activities.
However, Senator Lummis argues that the administration’s approach could be overly restrictive and could stifle innovation in an industry known for its potential to revolutionize finances. 
According to Lummis, the right to “hold one’s own keys and manage one’s own node”, which refers to individuals’ ability to manage their cryptocurrency without intermediaries and operate independently on the blockchain, is a fundamental principle that should not be compromised.
The Importance of Self-Sovereignty in Cryptocurrencies
The concept of self-sovereignty is at the core of the appeal of cryptocurrencies. It allows individuals to control their financial assets without the need for banks or traditional financial institutions. 
This not only reduces dependence on these institutions, but also increases privacy and freedom from government control and supervision.
Senator Lummis’ advocacy for self-sovereignty reflects a broader philosophy within the crypto community that values the independence and democratization of finances. 
By emphasizing the right to personal control over digital assets, Lummis is advocating a fundamental principle of decentralized ethics that many in the cryptocurrency space consider sacred.
In her commitment to protect these rights, Senator Lummis has been active in legislative efforts aimed at providing a clearer and supportive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 
His initiatives aim to bridge the gap between technological innovation and regulatory policies to promote an environment where digital finances can thrive responsibly.
The efforts of the senator are particularly crucial at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is facing significant scrutiny from various government bodies. 
The challenge is to balance the need for regulation to prevent abuses and ensure safety, with the need to allow innovation and personal freedom to flourish.
The Biden administration’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies will have far-reaching implications for the industry. Effective regulation could provide the clarity and security that could help drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
On the contrary, excessively stringent regulations could limit the growth of the industry and violate individuals’ rights to manage their digital assets as they see fit.
Conclusions
As the debate continues, the cryptocurrency community watches closely, aware that the outcomes could set precedents that influence the future of digital finances globally. 
The stakes are high, both for the millions of current crypto users and for potential future users who could benefit from a well-regulated, yet innovative and free crypto market.
Senator Cynthia Lummis’ position is a battle cry for those who believe in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and who support minimal regulatory interference. 
His commitment to fight for individuals’ rights to control their digital destinies is a significant moment in the ongoing discourse on cryptocurrency regulation. 
As this debate unfolds, it will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of digital finance for years to come, making it a critical issue for all stakeholders in the financial and technological sectors.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:10 </pubDate></item><item><title>Binance: former CZ CEO sentenced to four months in prison</title><link>https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/02/binance-cz-ceo-four-months-prison/</link><description>The former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has been sentenced to four months in prison. The ruling by Judge Richard Jones is much lower than the 3 years of imprisonment requested by the prosecutors. 

Binance: former CEO CZ and the sentence of four months in prison instead of the requested 36
On Tuesday, Changpeng Zhao (or CZ), former CEO of the famous crypto-exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in Seattle for violating anti-money laundering laws. 
The sentence has come from Judge Richard Jones of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.
Jones seems to have not granted the request for 36 months of imprisonment for CZ, made by the prosecutors. Specifically, the public prosecutors would have stated the following:
“Intentionally violating US laws by Zhao was not an accident or oversight. He made the business decision that breaking US law was the best way to attract users, build his company, and fill his pockets.”
On the other hand, CZ’s defense lawyers had requested probation for him, stating that the former CEO of Binance had repented of his crime and had shown that he had taken responsibility for his actions. 
In this regard, here is the version of CZ’s lawyers:
“Mr. Zhao is a forty-seven-year-old who has committed his first crime. His life has been built on three pillars: devotion to family, the development of technology (particularly Binance) as a force for positive change in the world, and service to the common good.”
Binance: former CEO CZ and Judge Jones’ decision to four months in prison
Despite the versions of the public prosecutors and CZ’s defense lawyers, Judge Jones has decided that the former CEO of Binance will serve four months in prison. 
Specifically, the judge did not agree with the prosecutors’ request for 3 years, simply because it never emerged that Zhao was aware of the illegal activity.

Judge Richard Jones stated that he disagrees with the Department of Justice’s request for enhanced sentencing guidelines that would increase the sentence from 18 months to 3 years: “There is no evidence that the defendant was ever informed” of the illegal activity.
The Department of Justice lawyer argues that the judge should be able to infer that CZ was aware of illegal activities, citing a previous case in which a judge inferred that a defendant was aware of illegal activities.
In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, agreeing to pay a fine of 50 million dollars and resign as CEO of Binance.
Not only that, since appearing in court in Seattle, Washington, Zhao has not been able to return to Dubai, where his partner and some of his children live. 
The new educational project without involving cryptocurrencies
Meanwhile, last March, CZ launched a new educational project, without involving cryptocurrencies though. It is a new “gamified” platform that aims to provide free education for everyone.
The name of the CZ signed platform is “Giggle Academy”, defined as gamified and adaptive, created with the aim of educating disadvantaged children in developing countries, providing content that covers education from first to twelfth grade. 
Despite CZ wanting to emphasize that cryptos are not involved, he has not been able to exclude NFTs from Giggle Academy. 
And indeed, the new platform plans to make its educational content a gambling game, using a system that includes points, scores, rankings, and NFT badges. In this way, the project aims to become in the future a “learn-to-earn” system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:10 </pubDate></item><item><title>Switzerland: PostFinance launches its new crypto perfume</title><link>https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/02/switzerland-postfinance-launches-its-new-crypto-perfume/</link><description>PostFinance has announced the launch of its new crypto perfume: “Le Crypt Eau de Parfum”. Available in limited edition, the fragrance dedicated to cryptocurrencies has been created with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Switzerland: PostFinance launches crypto perfume created with the help of AI
The financial services unit of Swiss Post, PostFinance, has launched its new crypto perfume: “Le Crypt Eau de Parfum“.
Basically, the new fragrance that encapsulates the essence of cryptocurrencies has been created with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
In the demonstration video, the perfumer Uwe Manasse described in detail the method used for creating the crypto perfume, signed by PostFinance. 
First of all, Manasse would have asked the AI what scent cryptocurrencies should have. The answers suggested different fragrances that then became the ingredients of Le Crypt Eau de Parfum. 
In this regard, the AI would have suggested “silver notes” to evoke the idea of currency, “coriander” perhaps to recall the speed of transactions and banknotes, and “lavender” as a symbol of trust towards PostFinance. 
From this suggestion, Manasse then combined the different fragrances adding also musk and milk, to represent the man, and developed the new crypto perfume. 
Switzerland: the new crypto scent from PostFinance available in its branches
From what has emerged, it seems that Le Crypt Eau de Parfum by PostFinance is currently available in one thousand free samples at Swiss Post branches.
The new crypto perfume created using AI, adds to the multiple products and services, and contests, that PostFinance offers to its cryptocurrency-loving customers.
For example, recently, PostFinance had launched a new contest for its customers involving cryptocurrencies.
Basically, through his PostFinance account, if a customer had invested at least $100 in one of the 11 offered cryptocurrencies, he could have won one of the three bitcoins put up for grabs by the Swiss company. 
The competition lasted until April 30th and, in order to award the prize, PostFinance should proceed with the extraction of the future three lucky winners. 
Binance’s marketing move for International Women’s Day
The crypto perfume from PostFinance arrived right after even Binance, the famous crypto-exchange, had launched its “CRYPTO”, in honor of International Women’s Day on March 8th.
Basically, Binance has implemented a marketing move aimed at attracting the female audience to the sector through its new perfume inspired by cryptocurrencies as well.
And in fact, along with the launch of the perfume, the famous crypto-exchange had added a contest dedicated to women. Specifically, Binance had planned to reward the first 5,000 women who completed a crypto course on Binance Academy with a $25 USDT voucher. </description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:11 </pubDate></item><item><title>Shiba Inu Unveils Two-Phase Hard Fork Strategy For Shibarium</title><link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-two-phase-hard-fork-strategy-shibarium/</link><description>
								In the latest issue of the “SHIB Magazine,” the Shiba Inu team has disclosed detailed plans for the upcoming hard fork of the Shibarium network, marking a pivotal milestone in the project’s ongoing efforts to enhance its blockchain infrastructure. This strategic upgrade is aimed at optimizing the network’s performance, increasing transaction processing speed, and preparing the infrastructure for future scalability and broader adoption.
The Shibarium hard fork encompasses a comprehensive upgrade focusing primarily on two core components of its blockchain ecosystem: Bor and Heimdall. These components are crucial for the network’s operation, with Bor functioning primarily as the block producer layer by facilitating the production of blocks in a manner similar to Ethereum’s Layer 1, and Heimdall acting as the validator layer that manages validator committees and stake delegation.
Shiba Inu Team Reveals Two-Phase Strategy
Scheduled for implementation in two phases, the Shibarium hard fork aims to address several key areas:
Phase One – Bor Hard Fork: Slated for today, May 2nd at 2:30 AM EST at a specific block height of 4,504,576, this update targets the Bor layer of Shibarium. It includes critical proposals such as an increase in the calculation of state sync confirmations and a new mechanism to introduce a delay of 128 seconds on state sync confirmation to mitigate issues arising from network partitions.

This issue has been observed when reorg lengths exceed the sprint length, affecting the calculation of state sync events which could potentially lead to errors in node synchronization. The modifications proposed are designed to dynamically calculate state sync parameters to ensure consistency and stability across the network.
Phase Two – Heimdall Hard Fork: Scheduled for the following day, May 3rd at 12:30 AM EST at block height 3,941,864, this update focuses on the Heimdall layer. It introduces mechanisms aimed at achieving deterministic finality in the network, a significant enhancement that ensures the reliability and immutability of transactions once they are confirmed.
The overarching goal of these upgrades is to significantly enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. By streamlining the consensus mechanisms and optimizing the underlying infrastructure, the hard fork is expected to reduce transaction processing times, decrease transaction costs, and enable the network to handle an increased volume of transactions.
These improvements are critical as they contribute to making the network more accessible and cost-effective, which is particularly important for maintaining competitive edge in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.

From a technical standpoint, the upgrades to Bor and Heimdall are expected to involve enhancements to state sync mechanisms and consensus algorithms, which are vital for maintaining network stability and security. These enhancements are geared towards rectifying existing network issues and laying the groundwork for future advancements of Shiba Inu.
Moreover, the integration of features from Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade into Shibarium underscores a strategic alignment with industry standards and best practices, enhancing interoperability with Ethereum-based applications and protocols. This move is anticipated to not only improve the technical robustness of Shibarium but also broaden its appeal and usability across a wider range of blockchain applications.
At press time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded at $0.00002203.

Bitcoin ETFs braced a rough trading day on Wednesday.



The funds posted record outflows.



BlackRock’s IBIT fund bled for the first time.
U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted record net outflows on Wednesday, with BlackRock’s $15B IBIT fund bleeding for the first time since its launch in January.The development comes as BTC has shed 3.42% in the past 24 hours following a near 17% plunge in April, its worst monthly drop since FTX’s implosion in November 2022. As of press time, the crypto asset exchanged hands at a two-month low of $57,608, CoinMarketCap data shows.Bitcoin ETFs Bleed Over Half a BillionAccording to preliminary data by Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a massive combined net outflow of $563.7 million on Wednesday, making May 1 the largest single outflow day for the funds.
Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows, with $191.1 million exiting the fund. This eclipsed the $167.4 million drawn from Grayscale’s GBTC, which has seen total outflows of over $15 billion in the last three months.Ark Invest’s ARKB saw the third-largest outflow of the day, bleeding $98.1 million as BlackRock’s IBIT hemorrhaged for the first time since its debut. The fund recorded a daily net outflow of $36.9 million, ahead of Bitwise BITB’s $29 million.All the Nasdaq-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs posted daily net outflows on the day except for Hashdex’s DEFI, which saw $0 net inflows.
Franklin Templeton’s EZBC fund bled $13.4 million, while Valkyrie’s BRRR, VanEck’s HODL, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Invesco’s BTCO posted daily net outflows of $9.7 million, $6.5 million, $6.2 million, and $5.4 million, respectively.Read about the debut of Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs from the perspective of analysts:Analysts Evaluate Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs’ Disappointing DebutStay updated on a new Bitcoin money laundering pattern uncovered by Elliptic:Elliptic Uncovers ‘Novel’ Bitcoin Money Laundering Pattern

BTC’s key metric has presented a buying opportunity.
However, bearish sentiments remain significant in the market.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has flashed a buy signal, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted in a post on X (formerly Twitter). 
According to the analyst, the token’s MVRV ratio assessed over the 30-day moving average returned a negative value of -11.6%. 
Source: Santiment
This metric tracks the ratio between an asset’s current market price and the average price of every coin or token acquired for that asset. 
When it returns a value above one, it suggests that an asset’s market value is significantly higher than the price at which most investors acquired their holdings. When this happens, the asset is said to be overvalued. 
On the other hand, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset in question is undervalued. It suggests that its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 
Martinez assessed the historical pattern of BTC’s MVRV ratio (30d) and found that the last three times the metric dropped below -9%, the coin’s price surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. 
According to Martinez, a double-digit rally might be in the books for the leading coin as its MVRV ratio now sits under the critical -9% mark. 
Is a rally feasible?
Readings from the coin’s movements on a daily chart revealed that it broke below support on 30th April, signaling that the bears were in control.
Some of the key technical indicators observed confirmed the significant decline in bullish sentiment. For example, BTC’s Elder-Ray Index has returned only negative values since 24th April.
The indicator measures the relationship between the strength of an asset’s buyers and sellers. When its value is negative, bear power dominates the market.  
Likewise, the coin’s positive directional index (green) rested under its negative index at the time of writing. This showed that selling activity outpaced coin accumulation among market participants.

Regarding demand for BTC, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) trended downward as of this writing. Its RSI was 31.74, while its MFI was 39.71. These values showed that the coin was making its way to the oversold zone of the market.
If selling momentum heightens, the bears may push the coin’s price downward to $52,000 and, subsequently, to $47,000.

This innovative protocol, created by Casey Rodarmor, is strategically launching in conjunction with the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event in April, promising to expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond just a store of value.Understanding Runes And Its Operational MechanicsRunes introduces a new token standard that is optimized to reduce the network bloat associated with earlier standards like BRC-20, which congested the network with unnecessary UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). By utilizing a UTXO-based model, Runes ensures that its operations are seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin's existing architecture, improving transaction efficiency and minimizing costs. The protocol employs the OP_RETURN function, allowing for data to be recorded on the blockchain efficiently without impacting transaction outputs, thus facilitating cleaner and more scalable token management.Impact On Bitcoin's Ecosystem And Mining CommunityLennix Lai of OKX Global tells Benzinga that the timely introduction of Runes, which has sparked a surge in transaction activities. This surge is crucial as it mitigates the impact of reduced block rewards from the halving. “Since the launch of our Runes Marketplace, we've seen a significant increase in transactions, which helps compensate miners through higher transaction volumes and fees despite the halving,” Lai explains. This increased activity not only supports the mining community but also bolsters the overall security and robustness of the Bitcoin network.Moreover, the simplicity and efficiency of the Runes protocol are poised to attract a broader range of developers, fostering innovation and potentially increasing the transaction volume and diversity of applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.Darren Franceschini, Co-Founder of Fideum, elaborates on the economic dynamics introduced by Runes, especially concerning Bitcoin’s mining community. Franceschini explains, “Runes enables all sorts of new tokens to be built on Bitcoin. If these tokens become widely used, this would likely lead to a surge in overall transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. As we know, miners get a fee for every transaction they process. So, with more transactions, miners would collect more fees, potentially making up for the decrease in mining rewards.” He uses the analogy of adding new toll roads to an existing highway system to describe how Runes might create new revenue streams for miners, helping to mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards.Also Read: Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF Debut Records 0.2% Of First-Day US ETF Trading VolumeRunes And The Future Of DeFi On BitcoinEneko Knörr, CEO &amp; Founder of Stabolut, discusses the strategic and functional advancements that Runes introduces to the Bitcoin network. “Runes acts as a bridge, enabling the creation of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This opens doors for DeFi on Bitcoin, potentially bridging its current gap with Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD in the fungible digital asset arena,” says Knörr. He highlights how Runes’ design addresses limitations of previous token standards by reducing network congestion and elevating transaction efficiency, thus enhancing Bitcoin’s appeal for developing decentralized applications.Post-Halving Outlook And Runes' RoleThe post-halving period is often critical for Bitcoin, with potential implications for its price and market dynamics. The integration of Runes could play a significant role in this phase. The novel applications introduced by Runes could stimulate increased interest and demand for Bitcoin, which, coupled with the decreasing supply due to the halving, might positively influence Bitcoin's price.Furthermore, the introduction of Runes is timed with regulatory advancements such as the acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which could further bolster institutional participation and enhance the overall market stability and growth.Evaluating Bitcoin's Dual Role As A Store of Value And Utility PlatformThe ongoing development within Bitcoin's ecosystem, exemplified by the launch of Runes, is pivotal in shifting perceptions of Bitcoin from solely a store of value to a more versatile platform capable of supporting sophisticated financial applications and systems. This evolution is essential for Bitcoin's long-term relevance and dominance in the cryptocurrency sector.As the Bitcoin community continues to navigate these exciting developments, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a vital platform for deeper discussions on these topics. Experts will explore the implications of protocols like Runes on Bitcoin’s functionality and its broader impact on the DeFi landscape, offering insights that are crucial for both developers and investors in the digital asset space.Read Next: Consensys Alleges SEC Covertly Targeted Ethereum, Sparking Legal BattleImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:15 </pubDate></item><item><title>Bitcoin Dominance Peaked, Says Analyst, Altcoins to Take Charge? | Coinspeaker</title><link>https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-dominance-altcoins-charge/</link><description>

Bitcoin market dominance drops fast as BTC price decreases all the way to $56,500. The Bitcoin demand growth and the whale interest have also been on the decline since March end. 

The world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has come under strong selling pressure extending its weekly losses to more than 10%. Soon after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, May 1, Bitcoin (BTC) price tanked another 5% dropping to the lows of $56,500, before bouncing back partially. Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently stated that the “Bitcoin dominance has already peaked” while it’s time for altcoins to shine. “Altcoins start to wake up in their Bitcoin pairs, which means that the rotation is started,” he added.
Usually, a drop in the Bitcoin market dominance signals market participants that an altcoin market rally is around the corner since investors shift their capital from BTC to altcoins. Considering the huge size of the Bitcoin market cap, the BTC dominance currently in the market stands at around 53.9%. This is after the 1.75% drop in dominance registered over the last week. Despite this, the BTC dominance in the broader crypto market is up over 4.6% since the beginning of 2024.




Several market analysts have pointed out the drop in BTC dominance recently. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland noted a significant loss of support in Bitcoin dominance and expressed the intention to await the weekly close before confirming or negating ‘the breakdown’.
Meanwhile, trading team IncomeSharks observed on May 1 via a post on X that Bitcoin dominance is declining, suggesting potential for altcoins to capitalize if price fluctuations persist for several months. They also highlighted the unexpected resilience of many altcoins on that day.”


On-chain Data Hints at Weakness in Bitcoin, $50,000 Coming?
As said Bitcoin price has faced a severe correction under $60,000 as on-chain data shows weakness in Bitcoin demand growth along with the surge in short positions. This shows that one cannot rule out any further downside in the Bitcoin price from here.
According to CryptoQuant’s report, BTC’s recent decline can be attributed to a reduction in demand, marked by a slowdown in the growth of Bitcoin balances among long-term holders, decreased interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a rise in short positions in the futures market.
Data from CryptoQuant indicates that demand from long-term holders, defined as investors who consistently accumulate Bitcoin without selling, decreased by 50% in April. Balances went from over 200,000 BTC in late March to approximately 90,000 BTC.

On the other hand, the demand from Bitcoin whales has also been on a decline since March. CryptoQuant notes: “Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”

According to renowned analyst Scott Melker, the BTC price is unlikely to drop below $52,000 in the short term. Melker noted that despite the correction, which he considers relatively minor for a bull market, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet reached oversold levels.
“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pullback during this bull market, like those of the past,” he said.

																After several days of nosediving, bitcoin’s price soared by roughly two grand after the Fed’s refusal to increase the interest rates but dropped back down just as quickly.
The altcoins are in much better shape today, with numerous impressive gains from the likes of Solana, Ripple, Polkadot, ICP, PEPE, and others.
Bitcoin’s Volatility Continues
It was just a couple of days ago when the primary cryptocurrency was trading firmly above $60,000 and was even about to challenge the $65,000 level. That happened in the early Asian trading hours of April 30.
However, it failed to breach that level and started to lose value gradually amid large outflows of US ETFs and the disappointing debut of the Hong Kong-based ones. The landscape worsened on Wednesday as bitcoin slumped further to a two-month low of $56,500, leaving more than $500 million in liquidations.
All eyes were then on the US Federal Reserve in anticipation of its decision regarding the interest rates. As the US central bank said there will be no upcoming hike, BTC’s price jumped by two grand and neared $60,000.

However, it failed to maintain its recovery and dropped back down to its starting position. As of now, BTC stands close to $58,000, with its market cap up to $1.140 trillion. Nevertheless, its dominance over the alts has taken a major hit and is down to 50%.

Relief for Altcoins
The alternative coins suffered just as badly, if not worse, than bitcoin in the past few days, but most have reacted better with more impressive gains now.
Solana is among the top performers on a daily scale. SOL is up by 11.5% and trades above $130. PEPE has soared by 16%, while SHIB, DOT, ADA, XRP, AVAX, MATIC, and ICP follow suit with increases of somewhere between 6% and 12%.
The total crypto market cap has managed to regain around $50 billion from yesterday’s low. As such, the metric has neared $2.3 trillion on CG.

Michael van de Poppe acknowledges Polkadot as a promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside Ethereum.



Polkadot Founder Gavin Wood recently released JAM Graypaper, introducing the next generation of Polkadot.



JAM intends to bring Polkadot’s capabilities beyond the existing limitations of Web3.




Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe acknowledged Polkadot as a “promising Layer 1 Blockchain outside of Ethereum.” In his recent X post, van de Poppe shared insights on Polkadot’s journey from 2016, when Founder Gavin Wood released the Polkadot Whitepaper, till 2024, when he released the JAM Graypaper.







At Token 2048 Dubai, Gavin Wood shed light on the next generation of Polkadot that envisions revolutionizing the future of Web3. As per an official post released by Polkadot, the network aims to “provide the speed, scale, full decentralization, and ease of use needed to drive forward deep innovation across not just Web3, but the entire tech landscape.”



The principal part of the development is JAM, Polkadot chain’s new version, which intends to expand the network’s capabilities beyond Web3’s limitations. In addition, JAM is expected to bring groundbreaking scalability to the network.









Providing more insights into the matter, Wood released a technical Graypaper. In the JAM Graypaper, Wood introduced the basic concept of JAM, stating




“We present a comprehensive and formal definition of JAM, a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. In a single coherent model, Jam provides a global singleton permissionless object environment…paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.”




Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) has managed to escape the bearish track, showing a notable surge of 6.12% in the last 24 hours. However, DOT, currently trading at $6.88, has marked a significant decline of 21% in one month and a marginal decline of 1.04% in one week.

With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave Labs has recently shared what it says is its roadmap for the next five years. According to the firm’s proposal, it seeks to upgrade its protocol to the next-generation version 4 but would love to get community feedback on the proposed venture. However, Aave also noted that the V4 upgrade is only a part of a grander plan for the Aave 2030 grant proposal.
Aave V4: The Proposal
Aave Labs’ proposal, which aims at the complete overhaul of the protocol, will include “major upgrades and expansions” to the Aave Network, says the team. These changes will see the network add a cross-chain liquidity layer, deploy non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1, while also putting on a “fresh new visual identity”.




The team also noted that the Aave V4 upgrade would be featured on an entirely new architecture from the one featured on the previous three versions. However, for a more seamless integration of features such as its native stablecoin GHO, isolation pools, and RWA modules, the upgrade will also add a “Unified Liquidity Layer”.
Another part of the proposal mentions an automated interest rate feature that can adjust based on market conditions. In line with this, Aave says it is actively working with Chainlink to “define a clear set of data feeds”. Then the team also suggested Liquidity Premiums that factors in a borrowers collateral composition and adjusts their borrowing costs in kind.
Hopes for GHO
With all the upgrades that the proposal suggests, a notable part focused on growing the protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO. Since launching in July 2023, the GHO stablecoin has found it really hard competing with the likes of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). At least, so does its relatively low market capitalization of $49 million suggest.
To this end, the Aave V4 upgrade proposal floated the idea of improving the liquidation engine, such as variable liquidation bonuses and “soft” liquidations. It also hints at adding options to earn interest to boost GHO.
Furthermore, the big upgrade proposes a quick redemption mechanism in the event that GHO depegs. Although the proposal is still new, gathering feedback is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2024. That will then be followed by an on-chain vote. All things being equal, the team expects to roll out the full Aave V4 by mid-2025.
Aave remains the third largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of around $10 billion, per DefiLlama’s data.

With the cryptocurrency sector at the edge of its seat regarding the final outcome of the courtroom standoff between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, the regulator has filed its opposition to the blockchain company’s Motion to Strike its new expert materials.
Indeed, after Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn set the schedule for the two sides to argue the use of the SEC’s expert materials, the securities watchdog has filed its opposition to Ripple’s reasoning, according to the X posts by defense attorney and popular commentator on the case, James K. Filan on April 29.

‘Not an expert testimony’
Specifically, the SEC’s legal team’s five-page explanation as to why the court should deny Ripple’s Motion to Strike asserts that the declaration by summary witness Andrea Fox did not constitute undisclosed expert testimony as the blockchain firm argued, stressing that:



“It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert ‘ one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres.”

Furthermore, the agency highlighted that Judge Analisa Torres had previously already allowed and cited in the summary judgment another SEC summary witness declaration “over Ripple’s identical objection that it constituted an expert report,” referring to the testimony by the SEC’s accountant Christopher Ferrante.
Finally, the securities regulator pointed out that the “Court’s remedies discovery order did not require disclosure of summary witnesses before remedies briefing,” which means that the “SEC did not violate any rule or order by submitting a summary witness declaration,” therefore “Ripple can claim no surprise or prejudice here.”
Recent Ripple SEC news
As a reminder, Ripple had earlier filed a Motion to Strike the SEC’s new witness materials, arguing that Fox’s declaration represents ill-timed “sandbagging,” as well as opposing the $2 billion in damages over institutional XRP sales and arguing that the regulator has failed to prove reckless disregard for the law. 
Afterward, Judge Netburn gave the SEC until April 29, 2024, to file its response to Ripple’s motion, after which the crypto company had three business days to file a response according to the deadline that will be due soon, as per the information that Finbold reported on April 26.
Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of the prolonged court case, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51331, which suggests an increase of 6.55% on the day, as it moves to reverse the 2.17% loss from across the week and the 13.75% decline from its monthly chart, as per data on May 2.

Approximately 701,544 of the 1.3 million eligible wallet addresses were allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop squatters.On May 1, Chinese police captured the StarkNet airdrop identity forger, who assumed other users’ identities, claimed over 40,000 STRK tokens on their behalf, and converted it to around $91,000 worth of Tether (USDT).In March 2023, it was revealed that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of tokens from the then Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop from 1,496 wallets into just two wallets they had controlled.Airdrop squatters tend to sell their compounded rewards as soon as they receive the tokens, which usually results in a sharp decline in the newly airdropped token’s value.VIDEOSolana: Expectation Versus Reality.

In a recent exchange on social media, Dogecoin creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, doused the fervor surrounding SocialFi with a splash of realism. Responding to a post touting SocialFi as the pinnacle of crypto innovation, Markus expressed a pragmatic viewpoint, stating, "I find it interesting when I get money from it and extremely uninteresting otherwise."The term "SocialFi" refers to the convergence of decentralized finance and social networking platforms, promising a revolution in how users engage and transact online. However, Markus's candid response underscores the practical concerns that often accompany such ambitious projects. While some visionaries like Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, advocate for the potential of decentralized social networks like Farcaster, Markus's perspective reflects a more cautious outlook. His assertion hints at the necessity for tangible utility and financial incentive to sustain interest in these emerging platforms.Communications &amp; Social Media Sector by CoinMarketCapDespite the buzz surrounding SocialFi, its current market valuation stands at just over $1.33 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, industry analysts anticipate a potential upheaval in valuation as projects like friend.tech gear up for token launches.

																TL;DR

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced another sharp decline, falling to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw its price fall by 13% over the week, despite advancements in its ecosystem and a significant increase in its token burn rate, aimed at reducing supply.
Ripple’s XRP maintained relative stability in a turbulent market, with analysts predicting substantial future price increases based on strong technical signals.


BTC Price Swings
The cryptocurrency market flashed red in the past several days, with vitcoin (BTC) among the heavily affected assets. Its price briefly surged to over $67,000 shortly after the halving but headed south towards the end of April.
It plummeted below the $60K mark on May 1, with the freefall eventually leading to a multi-month low of approximately $56,600 (per CoinGecko’s data).
The bulls witnessed a dose of optimism several hours ago when BTC reclaimed some lost ground, jumping to $58,500. This happened right after the US Federal Reserve announced no additional interest rate hikes at its latest FOMC meeting.




However, the bullish momentum was short-lived, and BTC dipped once again to its current level of around $57,500.
Despite the somewhat grim reality, there are numerous factors indicating that the trends may change soon. Such examples are BTC’s negative exchange netflow in the past week, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric which has experienced a downfall, and the rising open interest (OI) weighted funding rate.
Perhaps the most obvious element hinting that a BTC bull run is still in the cards is the halving that took place last month. Historically, the event has been a precursor of a major resurgence for the asset and the entire cryptocurrency market. Those willing to learn more about its specifics, please take a look at our dedicated video below:
VIDEO
SHIB Developments 
The second-largest meme coin by market capitalization has also underperformed as of late, with its price tumbling by 13% on a weekly scale. On the other hand, it witnessed multiple advancements related to its ecosystem.
As CryptoPotato reported, the SHIB burn rate soared by 90% on May 1, whereas the destroyed assets throughout April equaled almost 1.7 billion. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply of the meme coin, making it scarcer and potentially more valuable in time.
Shibarium also made the headlines. The layer-2 scaling solution experienced an important upgrade last week and is scheduled to undergo another one today (May 2).
XRP Forecasts
Despite briefly falling below the $0.50 level, Ripple’s XRP remained rather steady during the latest market turbulence. In fact, its price is slightly in the green today and up 3% on a two-week scale.
Numerous analysts believe the asset’s best days are yet to come, envisioning wild targets for the following months. The X user Dark Defender claimed XRP could explode to $5.85 and eventually to a whopping $18.22 as long as it trades above the two major support levels – $0.46 and $0.39.
EGRAG CRYPTO outlined a bullish prediction, too, based on the token’s latest weekly candles that have not dropped below a certain resistance zone.
“Remarkably, not even the body of the weekly candles is closing below the arc, which is incredibly bullish! XRP Army, STAY STEADY! The XRP bulls are showing remarkable resilience, strength, and power in this battle,” the analyst concluded.

Riot Platforms, a US-based Bitcoin mining company, recently unveiled a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter 2024. The company announced total revenues of $79.3 million, a noticeable uptick from $73.2 million during the same period last year.
Riot also reported a net income of $211.8 million, earnings per share of $0.82, and $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA—new highs for the company’s quarterly financial performance. A significant 131% rise in Bitcoin prices, compared to the same three-month period in 2023, largely accounts for this increase.
Bitcoin Price Surge Drives Record-Breaking Quarter for Riot Platforms
Riot’s report revealed that it secured $5.1 million in power curtailment credits. The number is a boost from $3.1 million last year, demonstrating adept management of operational efficiencies.
The Bitcoin Mining segment alone brought in $74.6 million. The number is significantly higher than last year’s $48.0 million, driven by the favorable Bitcoin pricing environment. Conversely, the Engineering segment declined, generating $4.7 million compared to $16.1 million in the previous year.
Riot maintains a robust financial position with $692.5 million in working capital. It also reported $688.5 million in cash and 8,490 unencumbered Bitcoin valued at approximately $605.6 million as of March 31, 2024.
Additionally, the energization of the Corsicana Facility substation was a significant development in the quarter. The facility is slated to be the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility upon full development.

Besides the Corsicana Facility, Riot also expects its previous purchase from MicroBT in June 2023 to enhance self-mining hash rate capacity. The deployment of these miners has begun and is projected to conclude by the second half of 2025.

“We remain on track to increase our self-mining hash rate capacity to 31 EH/s by the end of the year, which will nearly triple our existing hash rate capacity. With up to 1 GW of total capacity when fully developed, the Corsicana Facility … gives us a strong foundation upon which we will continue scaling our Bitcoin mining business in the future,” Jason Les, Riot Platform’s CEO, stated.

However, Riot experienced a reduction in its Bitcoin production. Riot mined 1,364 Bitcoins in the first quarter, marking a 36% decrease from the 2,115 Bitcoins produced in Q1 2023.
The downturn in production can be traced back to the soaring Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023. This presents a formidable challenge for miners.
Furthermore, the average cost to mine a single Bitcoin soared to $23,034, dramatically increasing from $9,438 in the previous year. This surge reflects the 89% increase in the global network hash rate over the same period. At the same time, it also presents the escalating operational challenges in the mining industry.

Indeed, the mining sector remains fraught with challenges. The escalating electricity costs and the impending reduction in Bitcoin supply due to the halving event could squeeze operational margins. Regarding the current Bitcoin production cost, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, shared his perspectives.

“This means 1 of 3 things happens now: 1. Price skyrockets, 2. ~15% of miners shut down, 3. Transaction fees remain a lot higher on average,” Edwards wrote while admitting he is “expecting a bit of all three.”

In response to the latest outlook, analysts see some miners might diversify their business into emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts consider this shift a strategic move to mitigate the risks of the volatile crypto market while leveraging their computational power beyond crypto mining.
However, a January 2024 study by CoinShares suggests that miners with substantial Bitcoin reserves and robust capitalization are better positioned in bullish markets. In contrast, those with limited cash reserves and high operational costs per Bitcoin face heightened risks.

Riot’s strong performance in Q1 has yet to affect the company’s stock price positively. The stock price has decreased by 11.77% over the past five days.

The broader timeframe presents a similar picture, with RIOT down 36.28% from its year-to-date peak price of $17.62. At the time of writing, RIOT’s price is $9.82 during after-hours trading.

This, he argues, is putting an end to “bull market excess.”“For those of you around in the 2021 Bitcoin bull market, you will remember the massive derivatives led deleveraging events which killed it,” part of one post stated.“Are we seeing a derivatives led flush out today? I don’t think so.”An accompanying chart compared the comedown from Bitcoin’s trip to $58,000 during Q1 2021.BTC/USD chart with funding rates data. Source: Checkmate/XCheckmate referenced continued flat funding rates across derivatives as a clear distinguishing factor between the market now and three years ago.“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see. It suggests we didn't see a massive futures margin call yesterday,” he wrote.With that, attention turned to other sources for the latest BTC price cascade downward — one which at the time of writing had failed to recover much beyond the lows.“Futures markets also saw two statistically significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off,” the thread noted alongside a chart of the 7-day change in Bitcoin futures open interest levels. “We did hit two overheated points on the rally into the $73k ATH, but it cooled off quickly. Again, doesn't feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”Bitcoin futures open interest 7-day change chart.

                        The TOKEN2049 conference in Dubai saw numerous builders, traders, investors, and curious TradFi folks in attendance.What’s more, many renowned and wealthy locals were there, eager to learn about and invest in crypto.Cryptonews was there for the second day as well, talking to industry insiders about decentralized AI, DePIN, RWAs, and incoming regulations.The attendees discussed the crypto market branching off into two streams, as well as tokenizing trade, uniting Layer 2s, resolving network congestion, and much more. There were also plenty of impressive shows happening all around the event. Like this fire show for example:An impressive performance during TOKEN2049. Source: CryptonewsDuring the second day of TOKEN2049, Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab talked to:
Alizee Carli, Director of Ecosystem, Casper Association
Jesper Johansen, Founder and CEO, Northstake
Scott Lawin, Co-founder CEO, Candy Digital
Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer, Neon EVM
John Lilic, Executive Director, Telos Foundation
Sam MacPherson, Co-founder, CEO Phoenix Labs
Karel Kubat, Founder, Union
Alex Goh, Founder and Chairman, EMC Foundation
Thomas Messerer, CEO, Silencio Network
Veronica Wong, Co-founder and CEO, SafePal.
You can find each interview on the links above to watch, and you can read what these industry insiders exclusively told Matt below.Casper-IBM Governance Tool MVP Coming Soon
Alizee Carli, Director of Ecosystem at Casper Association, the team behind the Casper blockchain, remarked that all interactions will AI will have to be fully auditable by 2025 to comply with the incoming EU regulations.Blockchain is an excellent solution for that.Therefore, Casper Labs and IBM are working together on a governance tool, and the MVP will be launched in the third quarter of this year.Meanwhile, the Association’s ” big focus ” is real-world asset tokenization (RWAs).They want to expand tokenization, particularly with cash, cash equivalents, and other financial products.The team has spent the last 18 months bringing RWA tokenization protocols on Casper, including a native stablecoin launching in May.VIDEOCrypto Market Cap ‘Splitting in Two’
Speaking of RWAs, some are also turning to tokenizing staking.This is a way to tokenize validator node infrastructure, said Jesper Johansen, CEO of regulated custodial staking provider Northstake, which pioneered this method.This means that it can be traded in the secondary market.A key point here is that this is not a derivative, which is especially relevant from a regulatory perspective, Johansen said.This is a way for the company to increase capital efficiency in regulated funds such as ETFs.He said that, in connection with that, the crypto market cap is splitting into two currents now: the permisionless, decentralized crypto on the one hand and the regulated crypto on the other.Northstake has recently launched a pilot with 3iQ, CoinFund, and CoinDesk Indice, while the mainnet is expected later this year.Tokenizing Trade at TOKEN2049
Commenting on the DeFi developments and expectations, Sam MacPherson, CEO of research and development shop Phoenix Labs, noted that one of the biggest recent events has been the launch of Ethena.Furthermore, Maker is “LPing into Ethena at a large scale.”This has resulted in a tokenized cash-and-carry trade, which is a significant new development in the RWA space.VIDEOBanking Crypto
Veronica Wong, Co-Founder of SafePal, a non-custodial wallet serving more than 12 million users, said that the company is in the process of making new partnerships, as well as focusing more on the Asia-Pacific market.SafePal recently launched a completely compliant, smooth, crypto-friendly on- and off-ramp in cooperation with Swiss bank Fiat24.This allows users to open a Swiss bank account within 10 minutes and top up using crypto or fiat, paired with a Visa card to allow spending and transfer.This has solved “a lot of pain points” for users, Wong said.‘No’ to Network Congestions
According to Yuri Yurchenko, Chief Product Officer at Neon EVM, the only EVM on Solana, applications can benefit from this team’s product in various ways.A major one is parallel execution, solving the issue of congestion for applications.The users benefit the same way, Yurchenko said. No matter what they do, be it trading on DEXes or interacting with games, they will not be disturbed by network congestion.VIDEOEntering Web3 Through Games, NFTs, and Digital Engagement at TOKEN2049
Scott Lawin, CEO of Web3 fan engagement platform Candy Digital, told us that the team is entering the gaming space and will launch a mobile game globally this summer.The big focus there is not just on NFTs as collectibles or speculative assets but on their utility and ability to be used in different ways.Just recently, the team announced the partnership with the game-developing giant Kakao Games.Furthermore, Candy uses ticketing and NFTs to onboard people to Web3. The company’s aim has been to make this process easy.Additionally, through sports partnerships, Candy has enabled fans to get rewarded for these digital engagements. This brings people into Web3 and builds a loyalty program at the same time, Lawim said.Moving from Frankenstein ZK
John Lilic, Executive Director at Telos Foundation, said that Telos initiated the development of a hardware-accelerated zkEVM Layer 2 (L2) network in collaboration with Ponos Technology.“A lot of the ZK stuff right now is kind of slow. It’s a little bit of a patchwork of Frankenstein components. [There are many] compromises because it’s very, very hard to make this stuff work.”And because ZK is so difficult to have working efficiently, it’s key to think about both hardware and software sides from the start – it’s a more “holistic approach.”Telos is focused on the hardware part because this “can help inform the way you build your software.”That way, the hardware can accelerate the software.VIDEOUniting the Layers
Karel Kubat, the founder of the modular interoperability layer Union, argued that we are entering an era of thousands of L2s.These need to be connected, he said, but in a decentralized and trustless manner so that they can hyperscale.This is what Union does.Also, they’ve announced a partnership with Polygon, joining hands to keep UX coherent by unifying and aggregating all of these different layers together.Decentralized AI at TOKEN2049
Alex Goh, the founder of the EMC Foundation, said that this team’s goal is to integrate AI with Web3 technology.Among other things, the team is working on decentralized AI, RWA, and GPU-based DePin (decentralized physical infrastructure network).One of the foundation’s visions is that everyone should be able to participate in building AI—it shouldn’t be run by a single entity.“We’re envisioning an open-source, large model [that] can be run in a decentralized fashion followed by a set of GPUs” that are distributed and run by GPU-as-a-service provider, “and they all come together to power the application of decentralized AI.”VIDEODePIN Excels at Creating Value
Thomas Messerer, CEO of Silencio Network, is envisioning a future where a billion people will be using their product in a way they’re using weather apps, for example.The reason the team chose the DePIN route to accomplish their goal is because it “excels at creating value.”Compared to Web2 counterparts, said Messerer, Silencio is providing more value and growing “20x faster.”Additionally, the DePIN model creates communities that accompany this vision, enabling the team to crowdsource data – “mapping out a size of Paris on a daily basis.”Notably, the app has about a 75% retention rate on a monthly basis.

Sharing an update on its fleet upgrade, Bitfarms chief mining officer Ben Gagnon said:“In April, we fully upgraded two farms in Québec (Canada) with Bitmain T21 miners, improving energy efficiency by 51% at those farms and 9% on a company-wide basis.”The Bitcoin halving resulted in a 5.9% increase in network difficulty compared to March, further impacting the earnings of all miners. For Bitfarms, ongoing turbine maintenance in Argentina further temporarily lowered its monthly mining capacity.Related: Arkansas bills reining in crypto miners head for governor approvalThe April earnings of 269 BTC for Bitfarms were 6% lower than the previous month and 29% lower year-over-year.Considering that Bitfarms earned 9 BTC per day, its daily earnings amounted to roughly $551,700, based on a BTC price of $61,300 on April 30, 2024.In the first three months of 2024, Bitfarms earned 357 BTC, 300 BTC and 286 BTC, respectively. Additionally, Bitfarms’ treasury increased its Bitcoin holdings from 806 BTC to 830 BTC in April. Check out Cointelegraph’s beginner’s guide to learn more about Bitcoin mining.Magazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

ETH saw the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.
The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly.

Ethereum [ETH] continued to fall freely, sinking below $3,000 in the last 24 hours following a 3% drop, data from CoinMarketCap showed. The second-largest cryptocurrency was trading at $2,914 at press time, reflecting a 13.34% discount over the month.
The negative price action, however, did not appear to limit demand for the asset.
Unfazed users continue to snap ETH
According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum saw a sharp increase in new users joining the network. About 266.6k new wallets were created on the 28th of April and 29th, the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.

Network expansion is one of the primary measures for determining if a cryptocurrency is gaining or losing traction. The onboarding of new users indicated confidence in ETH’s long-term potential, ignoring short-term blips.
Retail users enter ETH market
On further scrutiny, it came to light that retail users were jumping on the bandwagon. The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly while the prices plunged, as per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data.
Source: Santiment
Interestingly, the cohorts holding more than 1 ETH were selling off, as evident in the drop in their ETH reserves.

The aforementioned findings suggested that retail interest was strong for ETH and healthy inflows from this segment could contribute to a relief rally in the days ahead.

Is staking the driving force?
Many of these retail customers buying ETH might be lured by the yields offered by ETH staking services.
The total ETH staked soared to 44.24 million as of this writing, forming 36% of ETH’s total circulating supply, AMBCrypto noted using Glassnode data.
At the same time, the supply of ETH on exchanges continued to shrink, falling to 12.79 million as of this writing, about 10% of total ETH coins in circulation.

Aave Labs has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol from V3 to V4.



The Aave V4 roadmap is part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal.



The timeline for the Aave V4 development is scheduled to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025.




Aave Labs, the blockchain firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave, has unveiled plans to upgrade its protocol. The proposed upgrade would lead to the launch of Aave V4, with a new architecture that would introduce novel capabilities to the protocol.



According to the firm’s announcement, Aave V4 would enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as the Aave-native stablecoin GHO more seamlessly. 



Although the Aave V4 roadmap is in an advanced research stage, the blockchain firm proposes to develop it as part of a wider “Aave 2030 grant” proposal. Aave is adopting a transparent model of development involving the project’s community throughout the feedback and testing phases.



Meanwhile, Aave Labs has scheduled a timeline for the Aave V4 development to run from Q2 2024 until mid-2025 when it fully releases the protocol. According to Aave Labs, it will act as the technical contributor, while the Aave DAO will deploy all code bases made available by Aave Labs and other contributors.









In a recent post on X, the blockchain firm classified Aave V4 as a significant advancement in DeFi. According to the post, the upgrade will establish new frontiers, including capital efficiency, risk management, and scalability. The Aave V4 development is coming about two years after launching the current iteration, Aave V3, on several networks. The current version went live on the Ethereum mainnet in early 2023.

However, trading activity has been disappointing. The Hong Kong-based ETFs only amassed $12.4 million in trading volume during the first day, which pales compared to the first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, valued at $4.6 billion.However, this is a high figure considering the size of the Hong Kong market, equivalent to $1.6 billion worth of trading volume in the United States, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas’ April 30 X post:“You have to understand [that Hong Kong] is 1/168th the size of the U.S…While the inflows were relatively small, the debut of the Hong Kong ETFs could set a significant precedent for other jurisdictions, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of DFG, who told Cointelegraph:“These ETFs open up Asian markets to crypto exposure, which can likely push prices up in the long term as more countries likely follow the footsteps of Hong Kong as well."Related: Bitcoin down 20%+ from all-time highs — Is BTC price headed to $50K?Could Bitcoin revisit the $50,000 mark after the Hong Kong ETF debut?The debut of the first Hong Kong ETFs proved to be a “sell-the-news” type event for Bitcoin holders, as BTC fell below the $60,000 psychological mark on May 1, a day after the debut of the new ETFs.The last time Bitcoin traded below $60,000 was at the end of February, according to CoinMarketCap.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart.

As the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector resume their trading in the green, Dogecoin (DOGE) is no exception, and its recent price correction might have just been in preparation for an upcoming massively bullish rally, according to the market’s renowned expert.
Indeed, professional crypto trader Ali Martinez has suggested that the previous price correction of Dogecoin was just “part of its usual behavior before massive bull runs,” as per the analysis and chart pattern observations he shared in a X thread on May 2.
Specifically, the analyst highlighted that DOGE’s breaking out of a descending triangle pattern in 2017 preceded a 40% retracement before the popular doge meme crypto asset continued to kickstart an earth-shattering 982% bull run in the months that followed.

Then, in 2021, DOGE performed a similar price action again, this time around retracing by a more significant 56% before proceeding to make a face-melting advance of 12,197%, which saw it skyrocket from a mere $0.0002 to the area around a whopping $0.0245.

Recently, DOGE has repeated the price action of breaking out of a descending triangle once again and is “currently undergoing a 47% price correction, very similar to previous cycles, which could ignite the next DOGE bull run,” as Martinez stressed.

Meanwhile, the eighth-largest asset in the crypto market is presently trading at the price of $0.12833, which suggests an increase of 3.58% on the day, as it moves to reverse the loss of 14.28% from its weekly chart and the 30.74% dip accumulated on its monthly chart, according to the most recent data obtained on May 2.

All things considered, Dogecoin could, indeed, be on its way to a massive bull run that could even overshadow the previous two occasions when it performed similar price action. However, things in this sector can sometimes make surprising twists, so doing one’s own research is critical before investing.

Bitcoin’s price drop indicates its role as a leading indicator of market risk sentiment and liquidity dynamics.



The Federal Reserve’s tightening stance heightens Bitcoin’s volatility, stirring concerns about market stability. 



Bitcoin’s value mirrors macroeconomic factors; potential relief may arrive if inflation eases and the Fed embraces a more accommodative approach.




Bitcoin’s recent price decline has drawn attention, with its volatility potentially signaling broader shifts in global market risk appetite. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, over the past two days, the cryptocurrency has dropped about 4%, following a significant 16% decline in April, marking its worst monthly performance since November 2022, when FTX, the digital-asset empire of Sam Bankman-Fried, faced a collapse.



Currently trading around $57,505.60, Bitcoin is at a two-month low and has dropped by 4.01% in the past 24 hours. Investors often analyze Bitcoin’s price movements for insights into changing liquidity dynamics that can impact other assets. The recent slide coincided with the Federal Reserve’s indication of keeping interest rates higher for longer, which tightened financial conditions by boosting Treasury yields and the dollar.



Charlie Morris, Chief Investment Officer at ByteTree Asset Management, referred to Bitcoin as a “favorite canary,” suggesting it serves as an early warning signal for financial market troubles, but also noting that it typically rebounds eventually. Morris highlighted the recent strength of the US dollar as a potential indicator of forthcoming market tightness.



Bitcoin’s record high of nearly $74,000 in mid-March was driven by a surge in inflows into debut US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from major institutions like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. However, the demand for these products waned, and this week’s launch of spot-Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong failed to provide a boost. Discounts to net asset value for some US portfolios have widened to record levels, underscoring the challenges posed by Bitcoin’s volatility.










Historical data compiled by Bloomberg shows that Bitcoin has posted four April declines over the past decade, with three of them preceding May losses averaging 18%. Despite these trends, if inflation pressures ease and markets anticipate a more accommodative Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments could experience some relief.



As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a possible rate reduction this year, he also acknowledged persistent inflation concerns. This suggests that the market will closely monitor inflation, employment, and economic data in the coming months for any unexpected developments that could impact potential rate cuts.

BlackRock has spearheaded a $47 million investment round for Securitize, a firm focused on tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). 
Announced on May 1, this strategic infusion of capital marks a crucial step in the evolution of digital asset securities.
How Securitize Plans to Use $47 Million Funding
Securitize is set to use this funding to propel product development, expand internationally, and enhance partnerships across the financial industry. Investors in this round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital, and Tradeweb Markets, alongside other key players such as Aptos Labs, Circle, and Paxos.

“In our view, the transformative potential of blockchain technology to reshape the future of finance in general – and tokenization in particular – is promising,” Carlos Domingo, the co-founder of Securitize said.

Consequently, Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, will join the Securitize Board of Directors. 

“At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure. Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy,” Chalom said.

In March, BlackRock partnered with Securitize to launch its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This fund offers a stable $1 value per token and distributes dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens monthly. 
Investing primarily in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, the fund aims to provide yield while maintaining liquidity on the blockchain.

Importantly, BeInCrypto reported that BUIDL has become the world’s largest treasury fund tokenized on a blockchain as of May 1. It surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund in market capitalization. 
Since its launch six weeks prior, BUIDL has swiftly attracted market attention, with its market capitalization skyrocketing from $274 million to $375 million in April, an impressive 36.5% increase.

This surge aligns with a wider trend towards debt-based, high-yield investments. As of April 26, the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets reached a record $8 billion, marking a nearly 60% rise since February. 

These statistics exclude fiat-backed stablecoins and cover various assets, including commodities, securities, and real estate tokenization protocols.

The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been declining since April. BTC, which started May with a decline, continues to decline due to many factors.
While the effect of successive outflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs undoubtedly played a major role in this decline, BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe, reported that it was exposed to the spot BTC ETF in its last 13F filing.


Accordingly, BNP Paribas stated that it has invested in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
According to the notification made yesterday, BNP Paribas announced that it invested $41,684 in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF by purchasing 1,030 units.





Although the investment in the Bitcoin ETF was not large, it was considered a big step in the bank's adoption of BTC.
Analysts also stated that this move of the bank coincides with the post of Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Because Eric Balchunas said that many investment advisors, banks and other institutional investors have invested in BTC ETFs, but they have not yet reported and disclosed these investments.


Balchunas also stated that he expects more than 500 investment advisors to disclose their Bitcoin ETF holdings by May 15, the deadline for 13F filings.

								Widely followed analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could fall further after the flagship crypto asset hit a low last recorded in February.
Cowen tells his 801,000 YouTube subscribers in a new video that Bitcoin could experience more downward pressure if the price falls below the 100-day simple moving average (SMA).










“In the short term the thing to keep an eye on with Bitcoin is going to be your 100-day moving average because that is where we are right now. We just swept these lows [at $60,000]. So that’s what I would keep an eye on.
The 100-day SMA has been somewhat of a support here a couple of times… so you know if the bulls are going to try to hold, I imagine they’re going to try to make it stand here…
If they don’t hold it then your next area that you’re going to look at is going to be your bull market support band. And that’s all the way down at around $55,500 to $56,200. So that would be a little bit bigger of a drop.”

Bitcoin is trading at $57,943 at time of writing, down by around 22% from the all-time high reached on March 14th.
On whether Bitcoin is likely to reach an all-time high earlier than in previous cycles (left-translated peak) or will similarly witness an all-time high to previous cycles (normal peak), Cowen says,
“There’s a lot of sort of academic discussions between left-translated peak or normal peak…
what if this just ends up being sort of a mid-cycle top that’s just occurring a little bit later because rate cuts are a little bit later, we cool off for a while and we just pick back up in the post-halving year? Definitely an option.
If that doesn’t happen and we just pick up now then I would start to believe more so in the left-translated peak idea.”

Changpeng Zhao’s admission of guilt has paid off in his trial.



A report states that Zhao’s cooperation during the trial led to reduced sentencing.



CZ faces a four month jail term, while prosecutors wanted a three-year term.




The trial of Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ in the digital asset space, brought out the fact that cooperation plays a big role in the results. It is important to note that the crypto entrepreneur was sentenced to 4 months in prison. 



As per a report from CoinDesk, United States District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle noted that the billionaire’s contributions to charities were coupled with his willingness to accept responsibility while downplaying the fact that he had anything to do with the crimes being committed at Binance. 



The sentencing is more than CZ’s lawyers asked for while being significantly less than the one suggested by the US prosecutors. Prosecutors sought a 3-year jail term, while CZ’s lawyers wanted a mere house arrest. 









Zhao gets to keep his vast stake in Binance and also maintain his vast wealth. Better Markets co-founder Dennis Kelleher stated that the short sentencing proves that “crime pays,” while DOJ attorney Kevin Mosley agreed:




“Breaking U.S. law was not incidental to his plan to make as much money as possible. Violating the law was integral to that endeavor.”




Notably, dozens of letters were written in support of Zhao, describing him as a family man. The former Binance executive has led a mostly private life and has a college-age son, who sat beside his mother and nephew during the sentencing.Additionally, CZ emphasized his guilt multiple times during the course of the trial and his inability to correct the wrongdoings at Binance. On the other hand, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, never offered “a word of remorse for commission of terrible crimes,” said the judge overseeing SBF’s case.

On May 1, MicroStrategy announced the launch of a new decentralized identity platform, termed MicroStrategy Orange. This innovation was revealed by Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy during their “Bitcoin For Corporations” conference.



The newly introduced platform leverages the Bitcoin network’s Ordinal-based inscriptions to manage digital identities, which promises a new layer of functionality and security in the digital space. Unlike traditional systems, MicroStrategy Orange operates directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, bypassing the need for sidechains, and is capable of handling up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers (DIDs) in a single transaction.



MicroStrategy Orange stands out by being completely open-source and offering robust features tailored for the modern digital landscape. It aims to provide “trustless, tamper-proof, and enduring decentralized identities,” as stated in an early draft document of the solution available on GitHub.



The decentralized identity (DID) system allows users a level of pseudonymity akin to how real-world identities are distinct from Bitcoin addresses and transactions. This system will enable users to create and manage their digital identities independently, without relying on external validation or traditional identity verification processes.



An innovative application of this technology is “Orange For Outlook,” a tool developed by MicroStrategy to integrate digital signatures into emails, enhancing communication security and authenticity. The process begins when a user accepts an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, leading to the generation of a unique DID and associated cryptographic keys for the individual.



Following this setup, the user’s DID and public key are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling them to extend invitations to others to establish their digital identities.



Looking forward, MicroStrategy plans to expand the utility of MicroStrategy Orange to other platforms, including various messaging applications, social media networks, and sectors like e-commerce, enterprise, and fintech.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Not everyone was impressed, though, by MicroStrategy Orange. For example, here is what crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer had to say about it:







Udi Wertheimer is recognized in the cryptocurrency community for his insightful and often contrarian perspectives on Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. A developer and a Bitcoin aficionado, Wertheimer is known for his sharp critiques and analyses of crypto trends and projects, gaining a robust following on social media platforms where he shares his views.



With a background in software development and a deep interest in the principles of Bitcoin, Udi stands as a credible figure among both proponents and critics of cryptocurrency. He actively engages in discussions on the scalability, security, and future trajectories of cryptocurrencies, often challenging mainstream views on new blockchain initiatives.



Ordinals, a recent innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem, have been a particular focus of Udi’s commentary. This technology, made possible by the Taproot upgrade, allows arbitrary data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Ordinals have introduced the possibility of creating Bitcoin-native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by associating unique data with specific satoshis, thereby expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond mere digital cash.



This has stirred debates within the Bitcoin community about the implications of such uses on the blockchain’s transaction sizes and overall focus. Despite this, Udi has voiced strong support for the experimentation with Ordinals, defending developers and users against accusations of harming the Bitcoin network.



He argues that such innovations align with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin and foster a unique on-chain culture, which he sees as vital against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. On 2 March, Udi expressed an extremely bullish view on Ordinals, predicting a significant rise in interest and suggesting they could become prime targets for phishing attacks due to their potential value. He also noted the prospect of high returns on investment in well-established Ordinals, emphasizing the transformative impact they could have on the market.

US prosecutors are looking into financial transactions at Block.



Block allegedly processed transactions involving countries under US sanctions.



The company also allegedly failed to gather sufficient information from its users.




Prosecutors in the United States are looking into the financial transactions at Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Block, the parent firm of Cash App and Square. 



As per a NBC report, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, the prosecutors are looking into the internal practices at Block and discussing with a former employee the alleged widespread and compliance issues at Cash App and Square.









The former employee at Dorsey’s company provided documents to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, which show that Cash App and Square customers were not asked to share sufficient information to assess their risks. 



The documents also reveal that Square successfully processed thousands of transactions that involved nations subjected to economic sanctions by the United States. Further, the documents also show that the firm processed transactions for certain terrorist groups. 



The former employee said that “from the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,” while adding:




“It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”




The document spanning over 100 pages shows many transactions, in even dollar amounts, being processed in countries under US sanctions like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyer, Edward Siedle, said: 




“It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”




The former employee also noted that most of the transactions, including credit cards, US dollars, or Bitcoin (BTC), were never reported to the authorities as required. When Block was alerted to breaches, the company failed to correct its operating methods, the employee added.

Token transactions made by the Hundred Finance hacker. Source: EtherscanAfter withdrawing the funds, the hacker converted USDT and other cryptocurrencies into ETH. This increased the exploiter’s ETH by more than $1 million. The hacker currently holds a total of $4.3 million in assets in the wallet, which includes various crypto assets like Dai (DAI), Wrapped Ether, Frax and Wrapped Bitcoin. On April 15, 2023, the DeFi protocol reported that it had suffered a security breach on the layer-2 network Optimism. According to the blockchain security firm CertiK, the attacker manipulated the exchange rate between ERC-20 tokens and hTOKENS. This allowed them to withdraw more tokens than were deposited. This is commonly known in the DeFi world as a flash loan attack. This type of attack vector usually involves borrowing large amounts of funds with some form of uncollateralized loan from a lending platform. The attacker then uses the assets to manipulate the price of crypto on DeFi platforms. In the Hundred Finance hack, large loans were taken out under the falsified exchange rate. In 2022, Hundred Finance also suffered an exploit on the Gnosis Chain. The protocol’s liquidity was drained through a reentrancy attack, resulting in a $6 million loss.

According to a report from CertiK, flash loan attacks only accounted for $129,000 lost in April. Its largest single incident within the month only caused $55,000 in damages. CertiK said in the report that this was the lowest amount lost to flash loan attacks since February 2022.Meanwhile, losses to crypto hacks in general also decreased in April. Security company PeckShield reported that only $60 million was lost to hacks in the month. This represents a sharp decline from February and March, which recorded $360 million and $187 million in losses, respectively.Magazine: Woman accused of $6B scam, China loophole for Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs: Asia Express</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:31 </pubDate></item><item><title>PEPE flips ARB: A Fluke or start of a new trend? - AMBCrypto</title><link>https://ambcrypto.com/pepe-flips-arb-a-fluke-or-start-of-a-new-trend/</link><description>

PEPE manages to flip ARB in terms of market cap as price of the memecoin surged.
Social activity around PEPE fell, sentiment remained high.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price plummet led to corrections across the board for various currencies. The memecoin sector was also impacted by the same causing massive price declines.

However, PEPE [PEPE] was one of the memecoins that managed to see green during this period. According to new data, the third largest memecoin managed to outperform ARB in terms of market cap.

However, it wasn’t an easy journey for PEPE in the last few months. Starting from the 14th of March after testing the $0.000001082 level,  the price started to fall.
PEPE continued to show multiple lower lows and lower highs after this, indicating a bearish trend. There were no signs of reversal for quite some time, until the 23rd of April, when it tested the $0.000000793 level and broke the cycle of lower highs and lower lows.
Even though price hasn’t been able to push past this level in the last few days, some bullish sentiment and momentum may help the memecoin see green in the near future.
However, indicators weren’t on the side of PEPE at the time of writing. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) fell in the last few days.
A declining CMF indicated that the money flowing into the token fell significantly. Moreover, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) also decreased, implying that bullish momentum around the memecoin declined materially.
These factors indicate that PEPE might move sideways for sometime before retesting the $0.000000793 level in the future. At press time, the token was trading at $0.000006847 and its price rose by 6% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with this, the volume at which PEPE was trading at had also surged by 38% during this period.

Due to this recent surge in price, $3.09 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours.

Social data
Even though PEPE’s price surged and bears were making losses, a large part of its price movement would be dictated by social volume.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

In a recent tweet, crypto analyst Ali predicts an epic breakout scenario for the first and largest dog-themed cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Dogecoin (DOGE). Dogecoin experienced lackluster price activity in April, closing the month down 40%. May has also kicked off with a slow start for the dog coin, with its price down 3.39% so far. The current Dogecoin price activity has piqued the interest of traders and analysts, with many eagerly watching its movements to see what happens next. According to crypto analyst Ali, Dogecoin's price fall is typical of its behavior before major bull runs. Furthermore, Dogecoin's current 47% fall could be a healthy retracement, paving the way for a potential bull run amid a breakout from a descending triangle pattern. The descending triangle pattern, characterized by lower highs and horizontal support levels, usually signals a period of consolidation followed by a breakout. Given Dogecoin's history, the breakout from this pattern could be especially noteworthy. Ali cites examples to bring home his point. In 2017, DOGE broke out of a descending triangle. Afterward, the price retraced by 40% before entering a 982% bull run. Similarly, in 2021, Dogecoin broke out of a descending triangle and then retraced by 56% before rising by a massive 12,197%. Fast forward to 2024, and Dogecoin has once again broken out of a descending triangle and is currently experiencing a 47% price correction, much like past cycles. With DOGE breaking out of a descending triangle pattern and undergoing a significant correction, the stage might be set for a potential bull run, propelling the dog coin to new highs. However, as with any prediction on the cryptocurrency market, there are no guarantees, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes. Whether Dogecoin will soar to new highs or not remains to be seen. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was up 2.93% in the last 24 hours to $0.128, mirroring the general market rebound after a slump at the start of May.

And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000, according to CoinGecko data.But the damage has still been done. Per CoinGlass, the past 24 hours saw another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.Economist and trader Alex Krüger explained that this current cycle feels so different for traders because it's largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year."There has been barely any new retail coming into crypto," he wrote on Twitter. "It's been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve."Analysts mostly attributed crashing crypto prices to fear in the market over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee—which sets monetary policy and controls U.S. federal interest rates—would not lower rates. Then the Fed did exactly what the majority of investors thought it'd do by keeping interest rates unchanged, and crypto assets traded sideways.During a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”But even President Joe Biden has been optimistic that the Fed will still lower rates this year. "I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out, there'll be a rate cut," he said during a press conference in Japan last month. "This may delay it a month or so, I'm not sure of that."He was referring to the hotter-than-expected March inflation report that had just been released at the time.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:32 </pubDate></item><item><title>[no-title]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/supported_browsers?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJt4Pog_nI3Y</link><description>Your browser is up to dateYou can use YouTube's latest features!Browse YouTube</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:32 </pubDate></item><item><title>Ethereum zkrollup: zkSync announces crypto partnership with Alchemy</title><link>https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2024/05/02/latest-crypto-news-for-ethereum-zksync-zkrollup-developer-collaboration-with-alchemy-platform-announced/</link><description>Yesterday, zkSync, a well-known zkrollup developer on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a partnership with the crypto developer platform Alchemy.
This news brings new features to the crypto ecosystem, expanding the connections of the layer-2 with the rest of the web3 world.
Meanwhile, a former zkSync engineer has decided to launch his own project Sophone, a hyperchain focused on the entertainment sector, inaugurating the sale of a series of validator nodes.
Let’s see all the details below.

Ethereum’s zkRollup solution lands on the web3 development platform Alchemy: progress for the zkSync crypto ecosystem
Yesterday, Matter Labs, the company behind the developments of the Ethereum zkSync zkrollup layer-2, announced integration with the Alchemy development platform.
Now the high-throughput second-layer blockchain, which represents the first rollup compatible with EVM guaranteed by zero-knowledge proofs, can be more easily leveraged by the developer community, relying on a convenient and secure tool like Alchemy.

Specifically, on Alchemy developers can access advanced APIs, custom RPCs, Supernode, Alchemy Signer for embedded accounts, and much more, all within a single dashboard.
By doing so, industry professionals are encouraged to build new blockchain applications, being able to rely on a suite of tools to scale and distribute such products efficiently across the web.
One of the unlocked features closest to the non-developer world is definitely that of custom RPC, which allows you to use zkSync zkrollup through an endpoint different from the one offered by MetaMask, often overcrowded with requests.
By creating a private API key (and going to the command line), users can use Ethereum’s scalable secondary network by sending transactions through a secondary endpoint.
Alternatively, you can go through Chainlist for the same purpose.

Soon on Alchemy new features will be unlocked at home zkSync like now the Sepolia Faucet, a developer education program a “collab merch” dedicated to chain operators.
Just one step away from the launch of the ZKS crypto and the supposed airdrop that will be dedicated to chain users, zkSync opens the doors to a new era of development for its ecosystem.
Based on zkSync with Alchemy, developers will be able to rely on a reliable, scalable, and accurate web3 infrastructure, ensuring a seamless development experience.
Former zkSync developer creates his own hyperchain Sophon: public sale of nodes announced
Another crypto news from the zkSync ecosystem, concerns the departure of the developer “0xsebastiena” from the Ethereum zkrollup team, in order to launch his own personal project.
This is Sophon, an entertainment platform that presents itself as a modular rollup that leverages zkSync’s Hyperchain technology and the ZK stack as the operating framework.
Basically, it acts as a layer-2 rollup that operates in validium mode, meaning it does not store transaction data on the main Ethereum network (thus it is cost-effective to use), designed to be customized for any high-performance application.
Its main fields of application are gaming, NFT ticketing , artificial intelligence for consumer and other entertainment sectors 
0xsebastiena presented the project to its audience on April 15, announcing in parallel two partnerships with Beam Network and Aethir Cloud.
The project has recently raised $10 million in VC funding through a round led by Paper Ventures and Maven11.

Just 15 days after the introduction of Sophon, a high hand grenade was dropped, starting the public sale of infrastructure nodes.
Anyone can decide to purchase a node, or better a token ERC-721 that gives the right to run the node itself (or delegate it) on Sophon.
The choice of public sale was made because the founder of the project has a great interest in the crypto world and can afford this option in order to decentralize their network as much as possible.
During this phase, you will be able to purchase a node at the price set by the reference tier: when the allocation of nodes for that specific tier ends, we move on to the next slot with a higher price, of course: first come, first served.
The node operators will obviously receive the commissions from the Sopshon network as well as an incentive directly in the next governance token $SOPH (20% of the total supply) that will be issued in the first 36 months after the mainnet launch.
More than 18,500 ETH have already been collected in this public fundraiser.

Attention if you are new to this field and want to expose yourself to the purchase of nodes. 
Assess the situation carefully and make the necessary considerations in light of the expenses you will have to incur to keep the node operational and the economic incentives you will receive.
A particular user has pointed out how this sale of nodes represents only and exclusively a method that allows the project team to make money.

								Peter Schiff, a popular critic of Bitcoin and staunch advocate for Gold, has delved into the ongoing debate surrounding BTC’s valuation, predicting a potential downside pressure in the near future and setting his target at the $54,000 price level.
Bitcoin Continues To Face Downside Pressure
Earlier today, Schiff identified a negative pattern on the Bitcoin chart, indicating that the price of the cryptocurrency is likely to decline. He claims that the most recent examination of Bitcoin’s short-term chart demonstrates a shift in the attitudes of the market.
Schiff’s observation was made amid a background of elevated volatility and erratic sentiment, as Bitcoin has been moving in a downward direction over the last several days. The recent disclosure by the economist about the short-term downside objective of Bitcoin has garnered significant interest from the cryptocurrency community.

According to him, the pivotal $60,000, which was observed to be a support level on this shorter-term BTC chart, has turned into a resistance level. As a result, Schiff suggests a negative change in trend due to a short-term head-and-shoulders pattern appearing on the Bitcoin chart. 
With the neckline just below $57,000, Schiff highlighted that the head lingers around $60,000, while the shoulder is situated around $58,500. Thus, he has placed his downside target for Bitcoin at the $54,000 level in the short term.

Schiff also voiced concerns about the lack of discussion about the largest cryptocurrency asset from the American business news channel CNBC, following a decrease in Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the past few days.
Over the past two days, the BTC Spot ETFs have fallen by more than 10%, closing below their market high by about 23%, but yet neither the products nor BTC were talked about by the news channel in the timeframe. Meanwhile, should the Spot BTC ETFs have increased by 10%, the digital asset would have been covered all day.
Peter Schiff has consistently attacked BTC over time. Earlier this month, the economist declared that buyers of BTC Spot ETFs will soon begin to pull out as the market’s volatility overwhelms them.
Given that the coin’s long-term bear market is starting to gather up steam once more, Schiff claims all of the new investors in the funds will be riding along with the wave, prompting his confidence that these investors will bail out soon.
BTC In The Bear Market, Party Is Over
As the market continues to fluctuate, the gold advocate addressed the current state of BTC, noting that the digital asset is in a bear market, despite all the excitement surrounding the spot ETFs.

“Turn out the lights HODLers, the party is over,” he said, claiming that one BTC is currently worth less than 25 ounces, up by 33% in comparison to gold, and down by 23% in the US dollars.

						</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:33 </pubDate></item><item><title>This is what a Trump capital gains tax could look like</title><link>https://finbold.com/this-is-what-a-trump-capital-gains-tax-could-look-like/</link><description>
President Biden recently made a stir with his latest budget proposal, which included several provisions that alarmed investors. The first and arguably most important for anyone involved with the stock market is the proposed new and increased capital gains tax.
Under the plan, the rate would reach its highest since the tax was established in 1913 at a maximum of 44.6%.
The proposal immediately proved controversial, given how it compares to the original maximum of 7% and the 1921 Revenue Act maximum of 12.5%. It is also substantially higher than the rate set during former President Trump’s term when it was reformed not to exceed 20%.


With this in mind, and particularly considering that Trump will in all likelihood be Biden’s opponent in the upcoming elections, Finbold decided to take a look at what the capital gains tax for stocks and cryptocurrencies might look like should the administration change. 
Likely President Trump’s capital gains tax
At the time of publication, there appears to be little room for speculation on what a Trump second-term capital gains policy could look like, given that the proposal has already been published.
Unsurprisingly, given the standard Republican approach, the Trump campaign plans to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%. This would follow his previous term, which saw the rate set at a maximum of 20%.
Still, it is noteworthy that such a decrease might face resistance. 
The fairly unintuitive fact – at least given the standard rhetoric – that U.S. public debt tended to increase more under Republican administrations could, when paired with the frightening pace at which the burden is already increasing, could make such a decrease impractical to implement.
On the other hand, the rising debt might not prove a hurdle for all parts of the tax plan depending on how willing a potential Trump administration would be to further cut social, infrastructure, and other public spending and refrain from boosting the defense budget – or, failing that, to ramp up the pace of debt-taking.
Still, while it isn’t certain just how the capital, dividend, and other taxes might look like under a second Trump presidency, it is likely the other controversial aspect of Biden’s proposal – the unrealized gains tax – would not see the light of day, especially since the campaign leveled hefty criticism against the current administration over the budget.

Recent trading activities suggest that XRP might be gearing up for a reversal on the market. The asset recently exhibited a significant bounce, pushing its price close to the $0.57 mark. This rebound was backed by a substantial increase in trading volume, hinting at growing interest from buyers and potentially setting the stage for a bullish market rally.Currently, XRP's price movement shows it outpacing other digital assets, indicating its strong position on the market. This progression is critical as it reflects a strength the asset possesses while the rest of the market clearly struggles. However, for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory and confirm a bullish trend, it must first overcome the resistance level at $0.52.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the chart further, XRP's price action finds robust support at around $0.50, a level from which it has managed to rebound. It suggests that buyers are stepping in at lower price points, despite the fact that it was not expected at all.On the upside, the resistance levels to watch are $0.52, followed by $0.57. If XRP can breach the $0.52 level, it could attempt to challenge the higher resistance, and a break above this could pave the way toward testing the $0.60 threshold.For the future, maintaining above the $0.52 mark is crucial. A consistent hold above this resistance could confirm a shift to bullish conditions, likely attracting more buying pressure. However, if XRP fails to sustain this breakout, it might move between the known support and resistance levels until a clearer trend emerges.

Bitcoin (BTC) began May with a significant sell-off after losing crucial support at $60,000 and falling as low as $56,000 leaving many market participants anticipating further declines.
This plunge comes as the crypto market remains on the edge, with uncertainty lingering about the potential onset of the historical post-halving rally.
In light of these developments, crypto analyst Plan B shared insights into Bitcoin’s price outlook for the remainder of the month in a YouTube video posted on May 1.


Firstly, the expert delved into the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, highlighting that Bitcoin closed slightly above $60,000 the previous month. While this marked a $10,000 drop from March, Bitcoin still maintained a 36% year-to-date increase.
Plan B emphasized the historical accuracy of the stock-to-flow model in predicting Bitcoin’s price. He pointed out that May 2024 marks the final month before the next halving event. Historically, each halving has coincided with a gray stock-to-flow model price, underscoring the predictive power of this model.

Bitcoin price targets
Regarding specific price points, the expert pointed out that while the current average Bitcoin price hovers around $34,000, it closely aligns with the ballpark figure of $55,000 predicted by the original 2019 model.

“The average price is something that we can calculate at the moment. It’s $34,000, and that’s a little below the $55,000 that the 2019 original stock-to-flow model predicted, but it’s in the ballpark. It’s the same order of magnitude, and don’t forget in 2019, the Bitcoin price was below $4,000. The average Bitcoin price was above the stock-to-flow model price in the cycle before the last cycle, the 2016-2020 cycle,” he said. 

Despite some fluctuations, Plan B updated the model’s parameters, maintaining an average target price of around $500,000 between 2024 and 2028. He highlighted the importance of the halving event in driving up the model value, anticipating a gradual increase in Bitcoin’s price over the coming months.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, the expert expressed confidence in Bitcoin reaching $100,000, driven by the need for mining revenue to recover following the halving event. He based this prediction on historical trends, noting that mining revenue typically recovers within four to eight months post-halving.
The trading expert also expects the market peak to occur in 2025, with Bitcoin’s price potentially surpassing $200,000.
Technical indicators’ prediction
Plan B also analyzed technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 200-week moving average (MA). He noted that the RSI has normalized to around 66 after reaching a high of 77. This normalization suggests that Bitcoin’s price is stabilizing within the context of previous market cycles.
He mentioned that the 200-week moving average has increased slightly to $34,000. The analyst described this value as a conservative floor for Bitcoin’s price during bull markets, indicating that Bitcoin prices typically rise well above this level during such periods.
Notably, Bitcoin’s current losses came after the halving event, while interest in exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows was exhausted. This has left Bitcoin investors focusing on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy amid stubborn inflationary figures. At the moment, the Fed has left interest rates unchanged.

As things stand, Bitcoin must now maintain its price above the $55,000 mark, as a drop below this level could validate sustained bearish sentiment.

The aggregate outflow reached the astonishing figure of 563.7 million dollars, a significant change in investor sentiment. 
According to SosoValue data, this event has marked a significant moment in the financial markets, especially in the cryptocurrency sector.

Trading analysis: The outflow of ETFs on Bitcoin spot in detail
The most significant outflow occurred in the Fidelity FBTC, which saw a withdrawal of $191 million from the fund.
This figure not only represents the largest withdrawal of the day, but also exceeds the previous record net outflow of 167.3 million dollars recorded by the GBTC of Grayscale.
The movement in these funds reflects changes in investor strategies and reactions to market conditions, which can be rapid and substantial in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.
Even Grayscale’s GBTC was not far behind, with net outflows of $167.3 million. This amount is noteworthy as it indicates a continuing trend where large sums are being moved away from what has been one of the most popular Bitcoin investment vehicles.
The ARKB of Ark Invest also saw a significant reduction, with $98.1 million leaving the fund, marking it as the third largest outflow of the day.
An interesting development has been noticed in the IBIT of BlackRock, which recorded its first daily net outflow since the beginning, totaling 36.9 million dollars. Similarly, the BITB of Bitwise reported outflows totaling 29 million dollars.
These figures underline a broader pattern of declining interest or strategic reallocations by investors within the bitcoin spot ETF market.
In contrast to these outflows, the Hashdex DEFI ETF has stood out by maintaining a neutral position with zero net inflows and outflows, highlighting its stability or different investor perceptions on that particular day.
The meaning of trend changes
These changes are significant not only for their size, but for what they mean regarding the general market sentiment towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments through ETFs.
The total cumulative net flow for the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs tracked stood at $11.2 billion at Wednesday’s close, indicating strong initial interest since their respective launch. 
Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an investment consulting company, commented on the situation through a post on X (previously Twitter), stating: “So, the iShares Bitcoin ETF had its first day of outflows ($37 million). That’s how ETFs work. Inflows don’t increase in a straight line.”
This drop in investment inflows comes after a significant enthusiasm around spot bitcoin ETFs that seems to have started to decrease. 
April marked a change with total monthly net outflows of 343.5 million dollars, interrupting a series of three months of inflows. Among these, the GBTC was particularly affected with 2.5 billion dollars leaving the ETF during the month, driving the outflows.
The declining interest could be attributed to several factors, including regulatory concerns, market volatility, and perhaps a reevaluation of the role of bitcoin in diversified investment portfolios. 
The dynamics of investments in cryptocurrencies are influenced by various global economic factors, technological advancements, and changes in regulatory landscapes, all capable of leading to rapid changes in investor behavior.
Furthermore, significant outflows may also reflect a broader trend towards risk aversion among investors, possibly due to wider economic uncertainties or specific developments within the cryptocurrency market. 
Since ETFs offer a relatively simple way to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with the complexities of direct ownership of cryptocurrencies (such as wallets and keys), movements within these funds can serve as a barometer for the overall investor sentiment towards bitcoin.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the outflows records from ETFs on spot bitcoin in the United States highlight a potentially critical moment for cryptocurrency investments. 
As the landscape continues to evolve, both experienced investors and novices will closely observe these developments to assess the future trajectory of bitcoin and its place in investment strategies. 
Whether this change is a temporary realignment or a sign of a deeper shift in investor confidence remains to be seen. The next few months will be crucial in shaping the narrative and investment models in the cryptocurrency market.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:35 </pubDate></item><item><title>Cigna Group's Q1 2024 Revenue Hits $57.3 Billion, Exceeding Forecasts - Tokenist</title><link>https://tokenist.com/cigna-groups-q1-2024-revenue-hits-57-3-billion-exceeding-forecasts/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=cigna-groups-q1-2024-revenue-hits-57-3-billion-exceeding-forecasts</link><description>

The Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) has reported its first quarter 2024 results, showcasing a robust performance and raising its outlook for the full year. The global health company announced total revenues of $57.3 billion for the first quarter, marking a significant increase from the previous year. Despite a shareholders’ net loss of $0.3 billion, or $0.97 per share, the adjusted income from operations stood at $1.9 billion, or $6.47 per share. 



The quarter also saw the company making headway with its sale of Medicare businesses to HCSC, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. This move and the reported financials reflect Cigna’s ongoing efforts to optimize its business mix and enhance operational efficiency. The company’s SG&amp;A expense ratio improved to 6.4% from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2023, indicating its successful cost management strategies. Additionally, the debt-to-capitalization ratio saw a slight increase, primarily due to the timing of debt issuance related to the Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements.





Cigna Reports $6.47 EPS and $57.3 Billion in Revenue for Q1, Above Expectations



Comparing Cigna’s first-quarter performance to market expectations reveals a company that not only met but exceeded forecasts. Analysts projected earnings per share (EPS) of $6.22 and revenue of $56.6 billion for the quarter. Cigna’s reported EPS of $6.47 and revenue of $57.3 billion comfortably surpass these expectations, signaling stronger-than-anticipated contributions from its diversified portfolio of businesses. The company’s ability to outperform amidst a challenging healthcare landscape highlights its operational resilience and strategic foresight.



Cigna Raises Full Year Earnings Outlook to At Least $28.40 Per Share



Cigna’s guidance for the remainder of 2024 paints an optimistic picture, with the company raising its full-year earnings outlook to at least $28.40 per share. This revised outlook reflects confidence in sustained growth and operational efficiency across its segments. The company anticipates adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion for the full year, alongside a consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $8.065 billion.

Aave Protocol is preparing for a significant upgrade with its upcoming V4 release, scheduled for mid-2025. 
This new version builds on the foundation laid by V3, aiming to transform the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with new features and improved user experience.
How Aave V4 Enhances Lending Protocol
Aave V4 introduces a new architectural blueprint to minimize governance overhead and enhance modularity. This change promises to optimize capital efficiency and integrate the Aave-native stablecoin, GHO, more seamlessly than ever before. 
Moreover, V4 will incorporate risk management tools and a more efficient liquidation engine to bolster security and user confidence.

“Given the competitive DeFi landscape, we believe the key to staying ahead is continued innovation, building, and shipping excellent solutions that address the ongoing requirements of the Aave community. The suggested ideas aim to position Aave at the forefront of DeFi in 2030 and beyond,” Aave Labs wrote.

The highlight of V4 is the introduction of a Unified Liquidity Layer. This feature evolves from the Portals concept in V3, offering a more abstract and independent framework for liquidity management. It will allow Aave to adjust supply and draw caps, interest rates, and incentives without the cumbersome need to migrate liquidity for new borrow modules.
Another significant advancement is the implementation of fuzzy-controlled interest rates. This approach automates interest adjustments based on real-time market conditions. The integration with Chainlink ensures the most accurate and efficient on-chain interest rate models.

Aave V4 also plans to introduce Liquidity Premiums. This feature will enable differentiated borrowing costs based on the risk profile of the collateral, fine-tuning the economic incentives for using riskier assets.
For user convenience, V4 will debut Smart Accounts. These accounts address the operational complexity of managing multiple wallets by allowing users to handle various borrowing positions from a single wallet interface.

Regarding risk management, V4 will adopt a dynamic risk configuration system. This system allows for asset-specific configurations that can evolve without impacting existing borrowers, significantly reducing governance friction.

The development timeline for Aave V4 spans from initial research in Q2 2024 to a complete rollout by mid-2025. This phased approach includes extensive community engagement, rigorous testing, and multiple audits to meet security and reliability standards.

MicroStrategy has been dedicating itself not only to investments in BTC for some time now, but also to the development of software based on the Bitcoin protocol. 

Bitcoin news: the MicroStrategy Orange protocol
MicroStrategy Orange is a new protocol developed by MicroStrategy and based on the Bitcoin protocol.
Indeed, Bitcoin before being a financial asset (BTC) is a decentralized and open source P2P computer protocol, which can therefore be used by anyone as a basis for developing protocols based on it. 
Furthermore, the name itself, Orange, is a clear reference to the color orange, which is commonly associated with Bitcoin.
MicroStrategy Orange is a decentralized identity (ID) platform built on the Bitcoin network. Its presentation yesterday took place during the MicroStrategy World event: Bitcoin for Corporations 2024, so it is mainly aimed at large companies. 
The company’s executive vice president, Cezary Raczko, presented Orange as a business platform developed by MicroStrategy for creating applications based on decentralized identities on the Bitcoin blockchain.
This is an IT platform composed of three fundamental parts, at the center of which there is a cloud-hosted service that allows issuing identifiers to its users and organization.
Thanks to this innovation, pre-packaged applications that work on the same MicroStrategy Orange platform and address specific challenges related to digital identity can be distributed.
The idea seems to be to be able to incorporate the ability to create a digital identity within Bitcoin wallets, to identify people in a certain and unique way. It could be used, for example, to ensure that the sender of a text message or an email is actually who they claim to be. 
MicroStrategy wants to become the world’s first Bitcoin development company. 
Why Bitcoin?
The reason why the Bitcoin protocol was chosen as the basis on which to develop this platform is the robust security features and immutability of its blockchain. 
MicroStrategy started investing in BTC in 2020, and now it owns more than 214,000 BTC.
Facing a total investment of over 7.5 billion dollars, now there is a capital in Bitcoin worth over 12 billion dollars, with an unrealized gain of over 60%. 
Since the company, which is listed on the stock exchange with the ticker MSTR, has a market capitalization of just under 17.5 billion dollars, the bulk of its value comes from the BTC it owns. 
It is therefore not a coincidence that in recent years she has also started working on the Bitcoin protocol. 
After all, even though it was founded in 1989, twenty years before the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is an innovative company that operates in the field of business intelligence, but also in mobile software and cloud-based services. 
So if on one hand it has chosen to invest in BTC at a financial level, now it is also working to invest in Bitcoin at an economic and productive level, with the development of new software based on the decentralized Bitcoin protocol. 
However, it is worth noting that yesterday the price of its shares on the stock market did not move significantly after Orange’s announcement. 
The usefulness of Orange
Yesterday Raczko stated that integrating digital identity based on Bitcoin with a broader ecosystem of verifiable credentials opens up a large number of very interesting use cases.
He mentioned, for example, the verification of academic qualifications, or the certification of participation in courses, and even medical records. 
The fact is that the Bitcoin blockchain is anonymous, or at least pseudo-anonymous, even though it is public, but the Bitcoin protocol is based on public digital signatures verifiable by anyone. 
The difference for this type of use is precisely the fact that the correctness of the signatures can be publicly verified with absolute certainty on the Bitcoin blockchain, despite it being anonymous. 
So associating a digital identity to those signatures makes it possible to use a public and verifiable system with certainty by everyone to associate a specific identity to a specific transaction, or to a document, so that anyone can personally verify without any doubt. 
Furthermore, the identity will not be published on the blockchain, which will remain anonymous, but thanks to platforms like Orange it can be verified by those who use it. 
Many companies could benefit from a system that allows to have absolute certainty not only of digital signatures, but also of the identity to which they are associated, without having to rely on third-party custodians who could always, at least in theory, be unreliable. </description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:37 </pubDate></item><item><title>30% Drop in Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales in April</title><link>https://beincrypto.com/crypto-trading-volume-nft-sales-drop-april/</link><description>
In April, the crypto and the non-fungible token (NFT) market witnessed significant declines, signaling a cooling period for digital asset transactions. 
As trading activities dwindled, key players and Crypto platforms faced marked declines in transaction metrics. This shift indicates a recalibration of crypto market dynamics, reflecting investor caution and a reevaluation of asset values.
Crypto Trading Volume and NFT Sales Drop
Data from centralized exchanges (CEXs) revealed a substantial decrease in spot trading volumes. These have plummeted by 35.7% from March’s $2.49 trillion to just $1.6 trillion. 
Binance, the largest player in the field, accounted for 43.7% of this volume, translating to approximately $699.25 billion.

Parallel to this, the NFT sector also experienced a downturn. NFT sales dipped to $1.15 billion in April, marking a 31.26% decline from the previous month. 
The drop was not limited to sales alone. Indeed, the number of active NFT buyers and sellers also decreased substantially. Buyer participation fell by over half, down 51.88%, and seller activity reduced by 45.72%, indicating a shrinking market interest.

The downturn affected several blockchains where NFTs are commonly traded. Ethereum and Solana, for instance, saw their NFT sales decrease dramatically. 
Ethereum’s NFT transactions halved, sinking by 56.8%, while Solana recorded a 39.4% fall in sales. This trend was consistent across various blockchains. However, only a few exceptions, like Immutable X and Avalanche, surprisingly registered increases in NFT transactions.

Specific Bitcoin-based NFT collections bucked the downward spiral despite the overall negative trend. In April, The Bitcoin Puppets and the Bitcoin-based WZRDs collection saw their values skyrocket by 2,064.97% and 25,796%, respectively. 

“Given that NFT loan originations are still dominated by Ethereum NFT collections due to the synergy between Blend and Blur, the impact of increasingly popular Bitcoin Ordinals on the NFT lending market may be worth watching,” researchers at CoinGecko wrote.

This suggests that while the broader market is in decline, niche collections can still capture significant interest and command high valuations.

Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi</title><link>https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-might-happen-in-bitcoin-in-the-future-analysts-shared-their-predictions-for-the-summer-months-here-are-the-details/</link><description>According to industry analysts, Bitcoin futures investors are preparing for a slowdown in market activity during the summer months.
Analysts Say Bitcoin Options Expect to Slow Over Summer

“Summers are typically periods of low volatility and investors start taking positions based on their biases,” said Bitfinex Futures Manager Jag Kooner.

Kooner stated that Bitcoin's volatility has decreased significantly since mid-April.


Data from the Data Dashboard also supports this, showing that the volatility of Bitcoin options for one-week, one-month and multi-month maturities dropped from 77% to below 60%.
Ethereum options volatility has also decreased to a similar extent as Bitcoin since mid-April.






Bartosz Lipiński, CEO of Cube.Exchange, interprets Ethereum's decline as a sign that investors are waiting for price fluctuations to calm down while waiting for Ethereum's regulatory status in the US to become clear.


“Typically, when there is uncertainty, investors become risk-averse, move into cash and sit on the sidelines, and I wouldn't be surprised if a similar situation is true for Ethereum,” Lipiński said in a statement.
Lipiński added that due to uncertainty about Ethereum's status in the US, whether it is considered a security or not, many investors will either stay on the sidelines or seek opportunities elsewhere until the situation becomes clearer.


However, Lipiński warned that in the summer months, when transaction volumes are low, volatility may increase due to liquidity gaps in the market.
“The summer months can be a relatively quiet period, as stock markets often are, but one only has to look back to 2017, the DeFi summer, and the last major bull run to see the effects of low liquidity on relatively bullish crypto markets,” he added.

Chair Powell said the economy is too strong to cut rates while ruling out increases despite disappointing inflation figures. Having lost the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday, BTC fell as low as $56,500 yesterday, with U.S. spot ETFs seeing outflows of $563.7 million, the highest daily figure since the funds listed in January. At the time of writing bitcoin was priced at $58,282, up 1.4% over 24 hours. The digital asset market at large is up around 4%, according to CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), as altcoins such as SOL and AVAX led a recovery from Wednesday's rout.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:38 </pubDate></item><item><title>BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has its first day of outflows</title><link>https://finbold.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-has-its-first-day-of-outflows/</link><description>
As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in the red, United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the crypto have posted record net outflows.
Significantly, BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded its first-ever single-day outflow on May 1, as Bitcoin lost support around the $60,000 mark, dropping to as low as $56,000.
US Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $563.7 million exiting the market, according to data from Farside shared on May 2. Notably, BlackRock, the largest investment firm globally, saw its streak of positive inflows cut short and recorded its first day of outflows totaling $36.9 million.

Elsewhere, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust saw the largest outflow at $167.4 million, while Fidelity and Ark ETFs experienced withdrawals of $191.1 million and $98.1 million, respectively.
Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETF
Despite the BlackRock ETF recording losses, the interest of institutional investors in the product remains strong. A notable example is BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe, which recently invested in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.
At the same time, as reported by Finbold, BNY Mellon, the largest custodian bank globally, also invested in ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale.
While ETF outflows are contributing to Bitcoin prices’ decline, some market participants maintain a positive outlook. For instance, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reassured that Bitcoin ETFs are still functioning well.

“Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he said. 

Bitcoin price remains under pressure
As the ETFs continue to record outflows, the market remains uncertain, with attention focused on the Federal Reserve monetary policy. Indeed, as things stand, the momentum from ETFs that saw Bitcoin rally to a new record above $73,000 has faded while investors await the gains from the halving event to play out.
In the meantime, there is speculation that Bitcoin could drop to almost the $50,000 mark. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $58,191, having gained almost 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is down about 9%.

Platform simplifies memecoin creation, sparking renewed interest.



Memecoin popularity dipped in April but appears to be recovering.



Increased deployments and rising index signal potential memecoin resurgence.




After a period of waning popularity in April, the memecoin sector appears to be experiencing a resurgence. This potential revival is fueled by a recent surge in activity on Pump.fun, a platform that streamlines the creation and deployment of memecoins.



Pump.fun removes the technical barriers often associated with launching a cryptocurrency. Users can design their memecoin with a name, ticker symbol, and image for a minimal fee, all without needing advanced technical knowledge or pre-existing liquidity. 



The platform even incorporates safeguards against rug pulls, a notorious issue in the memecoin space. Every token launched on Pump.fun automatically implements a bonding curve for trading, where users directly influence the price through buying and selling. 



Once a token reaches a specific market cap, a portion of the liquidity is deposited into a decentralized exchange and permanently locked, preventing developers from manipulating the token’s value.



Source: TheBlock



This user-friendly approach has been a recipe for success for Pump.fun. The platform surpassed a staggering $5 million in revenue within just two months of launch. Their daily earnings peaked in early April, coinciding with the apex of memecoin popularity. While revenue softened later in the month as memecoin interest cooled, Pump.fun maintained a steady daily income exceeding $120,000.









However, recent developments hint at a potential second wind for memecoins. The renewed activity on Pump.fun suggests a rise in memecoin deployments, indicating continued interest in the sector.

Additionally, the GMCI MEME index which is a benchmark that tracks the performance of memecoins, displayed a positive shift. After dipping in mid-April, the index climbed back above 300 last week, signaling a potential rebound in memecoin valuations.

Even at a supply of 120M, Ethereum demand is higher than supply. More coins are needed for staking and various security deposits, leaving less ETH to trade or move freely. Ethereum Usage Increases Token BurningEthereum is essentially the backbone of the current DeFi sector. Despite scalability issues, coins on the original blockchain are still needed and are even more valuable. One of the main drivers of ETH scarcity are the daily token burns, which accelerate with more transactions. During the peak NFT and DeFi market, Ethereum introduced the Ethereum burn program in late 2021. After the EIP-1559 upgrade, Ethereum introduced a new fee and block production schedule, where miners receive a base rate and all excess fees are burned. End users still may need to pay a relatively high fee for moving their ETH, but block producers will not be able to receive the excess funds. The fee burn program took off like wildfire, and so far the Ethereum network has burned coins worth about $12B based on market estimation. Liquid Staking Platforms Control Large Part of ETH SupplyETH owners have always desired to make use of their tokens, and liquid staking is a tool that aids in achieving that. Holders can now pledge their 32 ETH to secure the network while using the same liquidity in other ecosystems. The Lido liquid staking platform now draws in more than 28% of the ETH supply. More than 44M ETH are locked for securing the network. Lido and EigenLayer enable users to create value in new layers by utilizing tokens as collateral. A smart contract transparently locks the actual tokens, prohibiting their movement or sale on the market. Ethereum reports more than 122M in circulating supply, though there is some conflicting information. According to the burn tracker, the supply has diminished to 115M. For now, the network is experiencing slow deflation, solving the problem with the still un-capped supply. Ethereum Abandons Idea to Freeze ProductionThe older roadmap for Ethereum was to stall production at around 87M ETH. Initially, miners would be discouraged by making it too difficult to produce new tokens, leading to a mining ice age. But miners declined, stating fees were not enough to motivate them. With a mix of mining and staking, the Ethereum Foundation plans to continue producing blocks indefinitely. Token burns are achieving the supply drop, though not reaching the intended target of having less than 100M tokens. But staking and collaterals also turn ETH into a store of value. Over time, people may hold ETH for its value and only rarely use it for direct on-chain actions. Currently, multiple L2 networks offer scaled transactions that do not require Ethereum gas, but are still secured through the Ethereum network. The deflationary trend may also reverse, if fee burning and usage slows down. But during the bull market, increased Ethereum usage contributed to accelerating deflation and may have boosted the ETH market price. As of May 2024, Ethereum remains deflationary with 1.2M transactions per day and their related fee burns. Ethereum Still Not Easily ReplacedEthereum remains a highly secure network, even after phasing out the mining component. The high requirement of staking means it is too expensive to mount an attack. Despite the high fees and the creation of multiple L1 networks, Ethereum is still the go-to network for many projects and NFT collections. Migrations are also difficult and time-consuming. For now, projects discover workarounds such as L2 solutions, wrapped assets, synthetic tokens and off-chain computation. But some tokens are looking for multi-chain solutions and may transfer their activities to new blockchains.Ethereum is still highly usable for decentralized trading, as most of the prominent DEX have an Ethereum version.Will ETH Reach Extreme ValuationsThe recovery of ETH close to $4,000 during the current bull cycle was partly due to the fee burns and locked tokens. But long-term ETH price predictions still exist, as investors await the bull market to return in 2024 or 2025. For Ethereum, the price target of $10,000 has been talked about for years. So far, ETH has traded at four-digit prices, but only went close to $5,000 briefly. After the latest price correction, ETH dipped to $2,910.61, after briefly recovering above $3,300.

For years, rumors have circulated that Bitcoin’s largest mining machine manufacturer has secretly centralized a majority of Bitcoin’s hash power. The theory is down to more than a simple observation of the logo stamped on most mining cases.
No, skeptics think that Bitmain’s pool itself — not just its machines — secretly creates the vast majority of blocks that are added to Bitcoin’s ledger.
A sleuth found a clue in Antpool’s block template: A manually prioritized transaction immediately after the 6.25 BTC block reward or ‘coinbase’ transaction. This new research by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer 0xb10c seemingly confirms long-rumored practices by Antpool hiding its massive operation under the names of ostensibly independent pools.
In short, it warns that despite tens of thousands of decentralized nodes, Bitcoin might actually be quite centralized from a mining perspective.
One template and custodian for supposedly independent pools
Specifically, 0xb10c detected that BTC.com Pool, Binance Pool, Poolin, EMCD, and Rawpool show signs of using Antpool’s method for prioritizing the post-coinbase transaction.
Antpool might also use a sixth pool, Braiins, but 0xb10c was still analyzing its merkle branches as of the research publication time. Nearly identical merkle branches might indicate that these five or six pools often use the exact same template as Antpool for selecting transactions to include in a block.
In other words, all of these pools often use Bitmain’s machines, often assemble transactions according to Bitmain’s block template, often prioritize the same manually-configured post-coinbase transaction as Bitmain, and often send coinbase and transaction fees to the same custodian as Bitmain.
It certainly makes Bitcoin look a little centralized.

Has Bitmain secretly centralized Bitcoin’s proof-of-work?
Founded in 2013, Bitmain is one of the oldest continuously operated Bitcoin companies. It’s also gigantic and six years ago sought to IPO for over a billion dollars.
Every miner knows that Bitmain machines generate nearly all hash power on the Bitcoin network. What’s not common knowledge is the size of Bitmain’s coinbase- and fee-sharing pool, AntPool.
According to its publicly-reported hash rate, Antpool by Bitmain claims to generate just one-quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, 0xb10c suspects it might secretly control a majority.
Because Bitcoin’s mining rewards arrive randomly to the single miner who guesses the Bitcoin difficulty threshold’s lottery-like winning number every 10 minutes, miners pool together to share work and average out these random 3.125 BTC payouts.
Prior to the halving, coinbase rewards were 6.25 BTC. On April 20, 2024, that number halved to 3.125.
Today, just three mining pools control the majority of Bitcoin’s hash rate. However, new research is suggesting that Bitmain’s Antpool has been disguising its work and submitting its winning blocks under the name of third-party pools.
That Bitmain has a near-monopoly on Bitcoin’s physical machinery is common knowledge. By far the most prevalent mining rigs performing proof-of-work hashing around the globe are Bitmain machines. 
Despite its famously poor customer service and product quality variability, its proprietary ASIC technologies have made its rigs unstoppably ubiquitous.
Antpool claims to generate just a quarter of Bitcoin’s hash rate.

Corroborating research on Bitmain’s Antpool dominance
Mononaut found more evidence that seems to support 0xb10c’s theory that Antpool might secretly use third-party pools to cloak Bitmain’s dominance. 
Mononaut traced coinbase rewards from mining pools AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, BTCcom, SECPOOL, Poolin, ULTIMUSPOOL and 1THash, and Luxor. He found suspicious levels of cooperation from these supposedly competitive entities in allocating coinbase rewards to a shared — possibly Antpool-controlled — custodian.
0xb10c couldn’t confirm that SECPOOL and SigmaPool entirely cloned AntPool’s template, although they seemed to share a similar template. In all, it seems unlikely that up to nine major bitcoin mining pools use a shared custodian for coinbase rewards unless a single entity is behind all of their operations.
Antpool had little to say about the suspicious activities or research reports by 0xb10c and Mononaut. Its most recent English-language tweet only referenced ‘making every hash count.’
Marty Bent, Matt Odell, and Matt Corallo discussed the allegations during a lengthy podcast. Corallo agreed with 0xb10c and Mononaut: “There’s one pool that has near 50% of hash power.”
In summary, if Antpool doesn’t control more than half of Bitcoin’s hashrate through collusion with or control over other mining pools, it seems to be getting pretty close. Bitcoin developer 0xb10c as well as Mononaut found evidence suggesting that Antpool and its alleged associates might control a majority of Bitcoin’s average hashrate.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMultinational bank BNP Paribas purchased shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a form 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).According to the firm's 13F report filed May 1, BNP Paribas purchased 1,030 IBIT shares in the first quarter of 2024 at $40.47 a share, for a total of $41,684.10—less than the value of a single Bitcoin, at current prices.The second-largest bank in Europe by assets, BNP Paribas has allocated a comparitively miniscule portion of its investment portfolio to IBIT. Nevertheless, it marks one of the first verified occasions on which a major financial institution has purchased shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF—at least partially validating the thesis that institutional investors would be drawn to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Institutional investment managers with at least $100 million worth of assets at their discretion are required to submit quarterly 13F reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Banks and fund managers have up to 45 days after a quarter ends to submit their reports. That includes foreign banks, like BNP Paribas, if they transact in the U.S., like buying ETFs from American issuers.A Goldman Sachs report published immediately after the U.S. SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January cautioned that, "Time to market and demand across institutional investors may not be immediate."That argument was backed up by Matt Hougan, CIO of crypto index fund manager Bitwise, who pointed out that, “The truth is, most professional investors still cannot buy bitcoin ETFs,” adding that, “That will change through a series of 100+ individual due diligence processes over the next two years.”Since their launch in January, Bitcoin ETFs have drawn in $11.2 billion in net inflows, per data from Farside Investors, despite over $17.4 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).In recent days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent outflows, with over $563 million in net outflows yesterday alone. The cash outs have come as the U.S. Federal Reserve elected to keep interest rates unchanged, causing investors to shy away from risk assets like stocks and crypto.BNP Paribas' decision to invest in Bitcoin ETFs represents something of an about-face.In September 2022, Sandro Pierri, head of fund management group BNP Paribas Asset Management, said that, "We are not involved in cryptocurrencies and we don't want to be involved," adding that the firm had "not heard significant interest" in crypto from its client base.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:40 </pubDate></item><item><title>Friend.tech v2 airdrop could introduce non-transferable token</title><link>https://cointelegraph.com/news/friend-tech-v2-launch-non-transferable-token-concerns</link><description>Decentralized social media platform Friend.tech is preparing for its version two launch and airdrop on May 3, but a leaked smart contract suggests it may have controversial features, including a non-transferable token.The Friend.tech v2 smart contracts may introduce a non-transferable token with the airdrop, according to pseudonymous decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher CBBOFE, who claims to have potentially found the smart contracts, according to a May 2 X post.“Ticker is $POINT, not transferable unless to some whitelisted addresses. $POINT will be tradable on BunnySwap (FT native DEX).”A non-transferable token means that airdrop recipients won’t be able to sell or exchange the coins, except for certain whitelisted protocol addresses. Top restaking protocol EigenLayer has also decided on issuing a non-transferable token for its EIGEN airdrop, which was one of the main reasons behind the recent outrage surrounding EigenLayer.Friend.tech made the token non-transferable to make users pay the 1.5% fee, according to Kasper Vandeloock, quantitative crypto trader and adviser at X10 exchange. He told Cointelegraph:“If you can't transfer it, you are forced to sell it through them, which has the 1.5% fee… Which is kind of ironic, they bring this strong ‘we are anti-VC’ vibe to the table while being a profit factory for Paradigm.)”The new potential token, POINTS, will function as a utility token, allowing the creation of social clubs on the platform, which may cost a 1.5% platform fee according to CBBFOE:“New smart-contract called Clubs. Anyone can create multiple clubs and a bonding curve among several options. 1.5% platform fee and 1.5% staking contract. Club keys are bought with $POINT.”The new tokens will also be offered as rewards for users staking their Ether (ETH) and Points tokens in the Friend.tech smart contract.The announcement caused concerns among crypto enthusiasts.

The token is down over 47% since the airdrop, according to CoinMarketCap.W/USDT, all-time chart.

In a recent development that has stirred the XRP community, over $21 million worth of XRP has been transferred to popular crypto exchange Binance.The two transactions, which were flagged by the crypto tracking service Whale Alert, have sparked speculation regarding the intentions behind the sizable movement of funds.According to Whale Alert's tweets, the first transaction involved the transfer of 21.37 million XRP, equivalent to approximately $10.9 million at the time of the transfer, from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly after, another significant transfer was reported, with 21.34 million XRP, valued at around $10.9 million, moved to Binance from an undisclosed source. The timing of these transactions is particularly noteworthy, as they coincide with a period of significant volatility and uncertainty on the crypto market. XRP, in particular, has faced immense pressure in recent weeks, exacerbated by the broader downturn on the crypto market following a series of regulatory concerns and market corrections. It appears that these transactions may signal a sell-off by large XRP holders, commonly referred to as whales, who are offloading their holdings amid the bearish sentiment pervading the market. The recent crypto market crash has prompted investors to reassess their positions, with many opting to liquidate their assets to mitigate potential losses.XRP price shows resilienceDespite the prevailing bearishness, XRP has exhibited a degree of resilience in today's trading session. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading at $0.514, marking a 4.82% increase over the past 24 hours. While this uptick may not fully offset the losses incurred in recent weeks, it nonetheless suggests a degree of investor confidence in the digital asset amid challenging market conditions.In the end, the movements of large-scale investors such as whales remain closely scrutinized for potential insights into market sentiment and future price trajectories. Market participants will be closely monitoring developments to gauge the trajectory of XRP and other digital assets in the days ahead.

IQVIA Holdings Inc. (NYSE: IQV) has recently disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a solid performance across its diverse service segments. The company reported a revenue of $3,737 million, marking a 2.3 percent increase on a reported basis and a 2.9 percent increase at constant currency compared to the same period in 2023.



Particularly noteworthy was the Research &amp; Development Solutions (R&amp;DS) segment, which saw a revenue increase of 3.4 percent on a reported basis and 3.8 percent at constant currency. This segment, excluding the impact of pass-throughs, experienced a robust growth of 6.9 percent on a reported basis. The company’s contracted backlog in R&amp;DS stood at an impressive $30.1 billion, up by 7.9 percent year-over-year. Approximately $7.7 billion of this backlog is expected to convert to revenue in the next twelve months. The first-quarter book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.23x, signaling strong future revenue potential.



IQVIA Holdings Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



IQVIA’s financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2024. The company’s net debt was $12.09 billion, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 3.38x trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, IQVIA generated an operating cash flow of $522 million and a free cash flow of $377 million. These figures underscore the company’s robust financial health and ability to generate significant cash flows, further solidifying its position as a leader in providing advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry.



Analysts had projected an EPS of $2.48, whereas the company reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.54, slightly outperforming the expectations. However, the revenue of $3.74 billion comfortably exceeded the anticipated $3.7 billion, indicating a stronger-than-expected top-line growth. This performance is particularly commendable given the challenging global economic environment and underscores IQVIA’s operational resilience and the effectiveness of its business strategy.





IQVIA Expects Full Year Revenue to be Between $15.32 to $15.57 Billion



IQVIA has reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance, reflecting confidence in its business outlook despite the ongoing global uncertainties. The company expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $15.325 billion to $15.575 billion on a reported basis, considering the $75 million impact of the strengthening US dollar. This guidance suggests a growth rate of 2.3 to 3.9 percent, with a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 100 basis points.



Furthermore, IQVIA anticipates its full-year Adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,700 million and $3,800 million, representing a growth of 3.7 to 6.5 percent. The Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance is set at $10.95 to $11.25, indicating a year-over-year increase of 7.4 to 10.3 percent.

AltLayer, which launched its altcoin ALT in January, announced that it launched its staking service in late March.
According to The Block, AltLayer introduced the Reborne ALT (reALT) token, stating that the second phase of the staking program has started.



In the statement, it was stated that Restaked ALT is an automatically compounded ERC-20 token given to users who stake ALT in AltLayer's main staking pool.
At this point, it was stated that investors who have already staked ALT in the staking pool can convert their stALT tokens (stake ALT) into reALT using AltLayer's staking portal tool.






“We are excited to open Phase II of AltLayer staking and the launch of Retaken ALT (reALT).
reALT is an auto-compounding ERC20 token that captures a holder's ALT staking contribution and accumulates compound rewards earned.
reALT token is issued to users who stake ALT in the main staking pool.
“The introduction of reALT is key to the AltLayer ecosystem and enables greater staker participation in preparation for the upcoming launch of MACH Alpha, a rapid finality service that will help secure and scale Layer 2 aggregations.”

After the news, the ALT price moved upwards.

Fidelity eclipsed Grayscale in BTC ETF outflows on the 1st of May. 
BlackRock’s IBIT saw its first outflow as BTC struggled to reclaim $60K. 

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rough Q2 seems far from over. According to Soso Value data, US BTC ETFs recorded more outflows on the 1st of May, worth $563.7 million.
Surprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC dominated outflows previously, but didn’t lead the outflows as Fidelity’s FBTC took center stage.

BlackRock’s first outflow as Fidelity loses 2% of its BTC ETF assets
Out of the total outflows of $563.7 million, Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows with $191.1 million, Farside data showed. 
Grayscale’s GBTC recorded the second-largest daily outflow on 1 May, worth $167.4 million. 
Bloomberg ETF analysts noted that Fidelity’s massive daily outflows were “huge” and almost worth 2% of its ETF assets, 
“Damn.. while it is like 2% of the ETF’s assets, but a) it’s big for Fidelity and b) all of them getting hit today looks like.”
Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT, after hitting pause and going zero inflows for five days, saw its first outflow worth $36.9 million yesterday. 
Reacting to IBIT’s first outflow, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted, 
“Ruff day to be a #bitcoin ETF.”
The Fed rate decision didn’t help much with the sentiment either. BTC remained firmly below $60K after the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged. 
According to financial commentator Peter Schiff, BTC could drop to $54K after losing the $60K support. Schiff said,
“Notice on this shorter-term #Bitcoin chart that $60K, which was support, has become resistance.”

Among the impacted, Grayscale‘s GBTC saw an outflow of $167 million, BlackRock‘s IBIT registered its first net outflow of $36.93 million, and Fidelity‘s FBTC experienced the most considerable withdrawal of $191 million. Ark’s ARKB saw a net outflow of $98.11 million.Amid these substantial outflows, Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer at Bitrue, sheds light on the underpinnings of these market movements. He explains that the outflows are driven by a blend of prolonged high interest rates, geopolitical impacts and the recent peak market highs prompting investors to realize gains. “It's a combination of ‘higher for longer' interest rates, people realizing gains, geopolitical forces that impact equities, bonds and digital assets alike,” Quartly-Janeiro noted.

The Chief Strategy Officer also highlighted the importance of identifying whether retail or institutional investors are driving the sell-off, as it would dictate the underlying reasons and strategies for future investment decisions.What’s Next: As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and respond to various economic and geopolitical stimuli, the significance of understanding these dynamics becomes crucial. This topic and more will be further explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry experts, including Quartly-Janeiro, will discuss the implications of regulatory and economic factors on the future landscape of digital assets.Read Next: Why Bitcoin Might Drop Another 20%: 10x ResearchImage: Shutterstock</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 13:17:42 </pubDate></item><item><title>Shiba Inu Fees On Fire: What's Behind The 500% Surge?</title><link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-fees-whats-behind-the-500-hike/</link><description>
								The cryptocurrency market continues its wild ride in 2024, with established giants like Bitcoin facing headwinds while seemingly outlandish projects like Shiba Inu experience unexpected growth spurts.

Bitcoin Struggles To Find Footing
Bitcoin, the undisputed king of crypto, has seen its price plummet in recent weeks. After flirting with record highs above $70,000 earlier this year, the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $58,000 on Wednesday, May 1st. This price drop comes amidst a broader market correction and growing concerns about rising inflation and potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
Shiba Inu Soars Despite Market Gloom
While Bitcoin licks its wounds, the meme-coin phenomenon Shiba Inu is experiencing a surprising resurgence. Transaction fees on Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, skyrocketed by a staggering 500% over the past 24 hours.
This surge coincides with a 200% increase in active accounts on the network, suggesting a significant uptick in user engagement.

Experts are divided on the reasons behind Shiba Inu’s recent rally. Some attribute it to the inherent volatility of meme coins, where social media hype can trigger rapid price fluctuations.
Others believe the burning mechanism built into Shibarium, where a portion of transaction fees are converted into SHIB tokens and sent to a dead wallet, is creating a perception of a decreasing supply, potentially driving up the price.

What Does This Mean For The Future?
The contrasting fortunes of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu highlight the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin, with its established track record, is seen as a relatively safe haven by some, its vulnerability to broader economic forces remains evident.
On the other hand, Shiba Inu, despite its lack of intrinsic value, demonstrates the power of community and social media buzz in influencing prices.

The question remains: is Shiba Inu’s recent surge a temporary blip or a sign of a more sustained revival? The answer likely lies in the network’s ability to evolve beyond its meme-coin origins and offer real-world utility.
If Shibarium can attract developers and build a robust ecosystem of applications, it might carve out a niche in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. However, if it remains reliant solely on social media hype, its future could be as fleeting as the many dog-themed meme coins that have come and gone before it.
A Cautionary Lesson
The contrasting journeys of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu offer valuable lessons for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. While Bitcoin serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market, Shiba Inu’s rise highlights the potential for disruptive innovation and community-driven growth.

Ultimately, the future of both projects will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and navigate the ever-changing landscape of digital assets.

WestRock Company (NYSE: WRK), a leading provider of sustainable paper and packaging solutions, reported its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2024, results, showcasing a mix of achievements and challenges in a competitive market landscape. Despite a decrease in net sales from $5.28 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $4.73 billion in the current quarter, the company managed to post a net income of $15.5 million, a significant improvement from a net loss of $2.01 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. This recovery was attributed to the company’s aggressive cost savings initiatives, which have already exceeded its target range for fiscal 2024.



CEO David B. Sewell praised the team’s focus and execution, emphasizing the company’s better positioning in the market through efficiency improvements and innovative, sustainable packaging solutions. With over $160 million in cost savings and expectations to significantly exceed the fiscal 2024 target of $300 to $400 million, WestRock appears well on its way to capturing market share and driving long-term earnings growth. However, the decline in net sales was primarily driven by lower selling price/mix, affected by published price declines and softer volumes across its segments.



WestRock Beats EPS Expectations in Fiscal Q2, Revenue Miss



WestRock’s results present a nuanced picture when compared to expectations. Analysts had projected earnings per share (EPS) of $0.24 and revenue of $4.75 billion for the quarter. Actual EPS stood at $0.06, with adjusted EPS at $0.39, reflecting the impact of restructuring and other costs. Although the company fell short of revenue expectations by a slight margin, reporting $4.73 billion, the significant reduction in net loss compared to the previous year highlights effective cost management and operational adjustments. The decrease in net sales year-over-year was noted across all segments, with the Corrugated Packaging, Global Paper, and Consumer Packaging segments experiencing declines due to lower selling price/mix and volumes.





WestRock Refrains from Providing Specific Guidance



Looking ahead, WestRock has refrained from providing specific financial guidance for the upcoming periods, citing the ongoing preparations for its proposed business combination with Smurfit Kappa Group plc. This strategic move aims to create a global leader in sustainable packaging, with the transaction expected to close in early July 2024. The company’s decision not to issue guidance is to avoid potential delays in the transaction timeline due to regulatory submissions that might include financial forecasts. This approach underscores WestRock’s focus on the strategic merger, which is anticipated to enhance its competitive positioning and operational scale.

                                Dorsey's Block Involved in Illicit Crypto Transactions                                The United States investigators are currently examining Jack Dorsey’s Fintech Firm Block due to illegal Crypto transactions. Whistleblower states that Dorsey’s Block proceeded with many transactions linked to terrorist groups. What's the NewsFederal prosecutors in the United States are looking into Block, Inc., a company co-founded by Jack Dorsey. The investigation against the company is ongoing due to concerns about compliance violations within its payment platforms Square and Cash App. This investigation started after the Former Block employee from the Southern District of New York provided documents to investigators, informing that Square and Cash App platforms allowed thousands of transactions from users in countries facing U.S. economic sanctions. They even processed crypto transactions for strange illicit groups. These transactions through credit cards, fiat, and Bitcoin totaled around $57,805 on 2nd May. These transactions were allegedly not reported to the government as required.Dorsey’s Block Investigation and Shreds of Evidence  The Former Block employee of the company provided the documents claiming that Block didn't fix these compliance issues even after being alerted about them. This indicates serious problems in how the company handles regulations. Another unnamed source familiar with Block's internal operations supported these claims. Edward Siedle, a former SEC lawyer representing the anonymous sources, said that the top executives and the board at Block were aware of these compliance problems.However, an Attorney from Block’s side defended the company, saying they have a strong and flexible compliance program to deal with new challenges and changes in regulations, especially regarding sanctions.US Authorities Investigative Action on Other Crypto CompaniesThis investigation into Block, Inc. is happening at a time when U.S. authorities are cracking down on cryptocurrency companies. Recently, a case came across of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao where the founder of Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to a four-month imprisonment. Because Binance didn't maintain a proper Anti-Money Laundering program. Similarly, the founders of Samourai Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet service provider were arrested on suspicion of money laundering, although they denied the charges and were released on bail.In another development, Gary Gensler chief of SEC believed that ETH is an unregistered security. Consensys, a company working on Ethereum blockchain technology, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They accused the SEC of trying to control the future of cryptocurrency by targeting Ether, the cryptocurrency associated with Ethereum, as a security. This could have significant consequences for the entire cryptocurrency industry.ConclusionThese legal actions against cryptocurrency companies highlight the increasing attention and scrutiny from regulators. According to Coin Gabbar, authorities are focusing more on ensuring that these companies follow rules related to preventing money laundering and complying with securities laws. These developments highlight the challenges facing companies operating in the cryptocurrency space as they navigate complex regulatory landscapes and seek to maintain compliance while innovating in a rapidly evolving industry.Also Read: Dorsey’s Block Ventures Into Full Bitcoin Mining System

As the larger part of the cryptocurrency market begins to recover from the recent bearish hiccup, Ethereum (ETH) is no exception, but artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms currently do not see this recovery as a bullish sign for the crypto asset in the next several weeks.
Indeed, the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization is slowly pushing back up toward retaking the $3,000 level it had lost earlier this week after nearly two months of trading above it, following the most active day on its network for at least one year, according to the most recent charts.
Ethereum price prediction May 2024
However, despite such positive signs for Ethereum, the advanced AI algorithms do not see its price troubles ending by the end of this month, projecting it to drop to $2,534.25 by May 31, 2024, as per the latest data offered by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions on May 2.

In other words, the algorithms predict that Ethereum will decline by 15.33% from its present situation, taking into account technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others.
Ethereum price analysis
At the moment, Ethereum is changing hands at the price of $2,993.07, which suggests an increase of 3.57% in the last 24 hours, having lost 3.80% across the previous seven days and accumulating a dip of 10.78% over the past month, as per the latest data.

Meanwhile, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has observed positive signals for Ethereum, highlighting that April 29 was the most successful day for the growth of its network in over a year, having recorded 139,560 new ETH addresses, as he explained in an X post on May 2.

As Martinez earlier pointed out, Ethereum is facing a strong resistance level at $3,200, which has emerged as a significant barrier due to, in part, the substantial holdings of approximately 2.34 million addresses collectively owning 5.14 million ETH purchased at this average price.

That said, a pseudonymous crypto influencer with a large following on social media, Mister Crypto, expects Ethereum to hit the price target of at least $10,000 at some point in the next run while also envisioning other crypto assets, like Bitcoin (BTC) at $100,000 and Solana (SOL) at $1,000.

In conclusion, Ethereum could, indeed, proceed to drop toward the low price target predicted by the AI algorithms, although some crypto analysts might disagree, highlighting the importance of doing one’s own research before investing a significant amount of money in any asset.

Dogecoin (DOGE), a leading cryptocurrency inspired by memes, experienced a significant downturn, losing over 12% of its value in the last 24 hours. 



The price of DOGE, a favorite of tech mogul Elon Musk, has decreased by more than 23% over the past week and by 40% within the last month.




Currently, DOGE’s market price hovers around $0.1245. This marks an 83% decline from its peak value of $0.737, recorded on May 8, 2021. 



Despite this setback, the trading volume of Dogecoin surged by 75% in the last day, reaching $1.7 billion, with its market capitalization now at $18 billion.



Shiba Inu (SHIB), another popular meme cryptocurrency, also faced challenges, with its price dropping by 12% in the same 24-hour period. 




This recent fall adds to a 22% decrease over the past week.

Nevertheless, Shiba Inu has seen a significant 134% rise over the last 90 days, reflecting sustained investor interest despite shifting market sentiments.



Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume that increased by 50% to $833 million. SHIB’s market cap stands at approximately $12.3 billion.




A newer meme coin, PEPE, has also felt the market’s volatility. 



After a remarkable 560% rise in the last 90 days, PEPE has seen a 22% decrease over the past week, with an additional 16% drop in the last 24 hours.



PEPE’s current trading price is $0.000006, and its trading volume over the last day rose by 28% to $980 million. 



Despite recent declines, PEPE remains the third-largest meme cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $2.58 billion.



These fluctuations in the meme cryptocurrency sector underscore the inherent volatility and the shifting dynamics influenced by both investor sentiment and broader market trends.

Analysts Predict Upside Following 20% Decline | Bitcoinist.com</title><link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bottom-20-decline/</link><description>
								Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a massive downturn. However, popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has predicted that the cryptocurrency may be at the end of its correction, foreseeing potential upsides following a price bottom. 
Analyst Suggests Bitcoin Bottom Closing In
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Wednesday, May 1, Poppe declared that Bitcoin was at the end of its correction phase, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s anticipated bottom was finally closing in. 

The crypto analyst disclosed that BTC was down by 20% from its all-time highs in March 2024, predicting further declines possibly driven by market volatility and investor sentiment. As of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,719, reflecting a weekly decline of 9.53%, according to CoinMarketCap.
Poppe further confirmed on May 2 that Bitcoin had largely completed its downward trend. He anticipates another 5% to 10% dip, clarifying that it may take some time before the cryptocurrency recovers and gets back to its previous bullish momentum.  
Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin/Tether (USDT) price movements from October 2023 to September 2024, Poppe highlighted special green zones between $56,000 and $58,000 to monitor. He explained that these levels could serve as crucial support zones for a potential upside if Bitcoin’s price correction persists. 
Despite the pessimistic outlook, the potential for a price rebound could emerge if BTC hits its bottom, as historically declines to lower levels have often preceded upsides.
Sharing a similar sentiment, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that Bitcoin’s TD Sequential indicator on a 4-hour price chart was displaying a buy signal. He predicts that a rebound lasting between one to four candlesticks is expected for Bitcoin. 
Altcoins Set To Take Over As BTC Plummets
In his post, Poppe revealed that during Bitcoin’s period of consolidation, altcoins could see increased activity, potentially taking over the market until BTC breaks all-time high. The crypto analyst highlighted a recurring pattern, suggesting that Bitcoin tends to undergo a price correction before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the price settling into a neutral position once the FOMC session concludes. 

Poppe has stated that following the FOMC meeting, he expects BTC to consolidate and go sideways while altcoins heavily outperform as rotation kicks in. He has also suggested that the present market condition characterized by BTC’s decline makes it a favorable time for investors to buy altcoins.
“Bitcoin reaching sub $57,000 pre-FOMC as tonights’ FOMC is one of the biggest ones of the year. I expect us to bottom anywhere soon. Altcoins have bottomed already, and I think that’s where you’ll find the ROI,” Poppe stated.

SEC’s crypto involvement raises questions about partisan regulation in upcoming elections.
Darius Dale expects Biden-aligned policies in budget deficit financing.

Apart from the Bitcoin [BTC] halving, the US 2024 election stands as one of the most anticipated events of this year. 
Despite remarkable progress within the crypto industry under President Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory challenges persist. 
Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) increased involvement in the crypto sphere prompts speculation: Will the widening partisan gap in crypto regulation influence the approach taken in the 2024 elections?
Senator Lummis criticizes DOJ’s Bitcoin stance
Amidst these looming concerns, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently criticized the Department of Justice (DOJ) for its interpretation of regulations concerning non-custodial software wallets.  
Voicing her apprehension on the same, Senator Lummis took to X (Formerly Twitter) and noted, 
“I am deeply concerned by the Biden administration criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance.’ 
She added,

The dispute emerged when the DOJ charged developers linked to Bitcoin mixers like Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash. These activities were deemed unauthorized money transmission by the DOJ.
Senator Lummis’s comment highlights the contradictory DOJ’s approach against past Treasury guidance, potentially criminalizing core aspects of Bitcoin and DeFi operations. 
Insights from Darius Dale
Separately in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Darius Dale, CEO of 42Macro, discussed the impact of various developments on the crypto market and elections. 
Shedding light on the potential influence of President Biden’s administration on Treasury policy, particularly regarding how the budget deficit is financed. Dale said, 
“The Treasury knows the budget deficit is going to be, but how they choose to finance the budget deficit is sort of a discretionary.” 
This underlines the positive relationship between Secretary Janet Yellen and Joe Biden, and an expectation for policies that align with the administration’s objectives. 
Stock market trends
Historical data indicates that the stock market tends to exhibit strong performance in the period leading up to the presidential elections. In 2024, this trend is notably exceeding historical averages.

Needless to say, Dale emphasized the importance of understanding the interplay between sticky inflation and Treasury policy responses and claimed, 
“We know we’re kind of very much in that debate process, but the early indications of that debate process are certainly moving in a hawkish direction.”

A massive movement of 2 trillion SHIB tokens from Robinhood to an undisclosed wallet raises eyebrows, sparking speculation.



Analyst predicts a breakout for SHIB, targeting $0.000072323, advising buy orders around $0.000018343 to capitalize.



Inadvertent burns of 2 billion SHIB tokens reduce circulating supply, potentially boosting demand and price pressure.




Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, identified a big movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme currencies on the famous investment site Robinhood. Nearly two trillion SHIB tokens were moved to an unidentified wallet, raising questions in the crypto world.







Over the past eight hours, a mysterious wallet identified as -4D935 has acquired two massive chunks, each containing 875 billion SHIB tokens, totaling 1.75 trillion SHIB. This transaction, valued at $39.2 billion, has sparked speculation about the intentions behind the transfer.



Meanwhile, cryptocurrency expert Ali Charts has seen a bullish pattern building on the daily trading chart of SHIB. Ali predicts a potential breakout for SHIB, targeting the $0.000072323 level. To capitalize on this anticipated surge, Ali suggests placing buy orders around the $0.000018343 price mark.







Despite the positive outlook, the Shiba Inu community suffered a setback in April when over two billion SHIB tokens were unintentionally burnt. According to Shibburn explorer, a total of 1,695,717,536 SHIB tokens were deemed unspendable owing to mistakes in transactions. These tokens, worth millions, were irretrievably lost, serving as a warning to investors to double-check wallet addresses before transferring funds.









The inadvertent burns significantly reduced the circulating supply of SHIB tokens, potentially impacting its market dynamics. As a result, the shortage caused by these burns may lead to greater demand and rising price pressure for SHIB in the future.



According to the latest reports, the price of Shiba Inu has been revealed to be $0.000022 while the stated hourly trade volume is $822,779,927. SHIB has climbed 4.00% over the last 24 hours to confirm increased investor appeal towards the meme currency. The performance is also reflected in the live market capitalization whose high value is over $12 billion and the total number of coins circulating of more than 589 trillion SHIB.

Both Stellar and Cardano are crypto protocols with a long history in the ecosystem. They have evolved throughout the years and adapted to the changes and demands of the market. Let’s take a look at their similarities and differences, to find out which of them is a better investment. Then, you can decide if it’s the right time to purchase the tokens or if it’s best to do an HNT to IOTA swap at the moment.



XLM vs ADA: Similarities



XLM is the ticker of Lumens, the token of the Stellar blockchain. ADA, on the other hand, is the token of the Cardano blockchain. They share plenty of similarities. However, their approaches to various topics on crypto development are different. It’s important to take a deep dive into these factors before deciding which is the winner in the XLM vs ADA battle.




Smart Contracts



Smart contracts are the backbone of modern blockchains. Even protocols that weren’t created with this feature in mind have changed their software to include them, for the benefits they bring regarding the development of DApps. That’s the case with Stellar. In the beginning, it was intended to be a platform for cross-border payments, connecting banks and traditional payment systems. Although that feature still exists, Stellar now introduced smart contracts, allowing users to build DApps on top of it. Cardano, on the other hand, had this feature in mind for a while but didn’t deploy it until 2021.



Decentralization



Blockchain technology is intended to be decentralized and transparent, and protocols built using this architecture should follow suit. Stellar achieves decentralization by allowing anyone to create a node and participate in the consensus protocol. However, some critics argue the core development team still makes most decisions.



Cardano also encourages users to run network nodes and participate in protocol governance. Block consensus is reached using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, where anyone can participate.




Interoperability



The Stellar blockchain allows users to tokenize fiat currencies and assets, as well as transfer them. Moreover, it is designed to interconnect with other payment systems and banks. Anyone can use the protocol to build their own payment system using smart contracts, and these DApps would be compatible with one another.



Cardano focuses on interoperability with centralized banks as well. However, it also supports integrations with other blockchains, like Ethereum. This means that DApps developed on Cardano can be migrated to Ethereum and vice versa.



XLM vs ADA: Differences



Despite the similarities, Stellar and Cardano have differences both in their intended use and their technical infrastructure.



Use Cases



Stellar, as we mentioned, is mainly focused on providing a means for money transfers. You can get tokenized dollars and euros, but also Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It has developed integrations with large apps, like MoneyGram, to bring the benefits of crypto to its users.




Cardano, as an Ethereum competitor, is focused on providing users with tools to build DApps and foster the creation of an internal ecosystem, with the ability to perform any function needed, growing based on the needs of its users.



Consensus Mechanism



Unlike most blockchains, XLM cannot be mined or staked. All XLM tokens were created at the time of launch and distributed evenly in the following five years. No network participant receives token rewards now, neither by staking nor mining. Still, users are encouraged to run servers and contribute with the validation of transactions.



Cardano uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm called Ouroboros. Stakers must participate in staking pools, and block validation is assigned randomly among pools. The reward is then distributed between the stakers.



Development Approach



A defining feature of Cardano is its reliance on peer-reviewed papers. All the technical documents of the blockchain are peer-reviewed and approved independently. While this improves Cardano’s security and performance, it has caused it to stay behind in innovation, even if it started developing the features before other competitors.



Stellar, on the other hand, is not as tightly connected to the scientific fields. Developments come from the core development team and other collaborators and are promptly deployed on the main network.



XLM vs ADA: Which Is a Better Investment?



As we’ve seen, both cryptos are solid and successful. They’re both among the most valuable by market capitalization, although Cardano ranks higher. The decision on which is a better investment depends on what you need it for. However, the Cardano blockchain is probably a better financial investment, judging by its current value and the activity of its deve

Tron is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. It is currently ranked #12 by market value and top 30 by daily trading volume. It’s focused on the development of DApps using smart contracts, like many other projects in the ecosystem.



However, there are specific features that distinguish it from some of its competitors. If you’re thinking of investing in Tron, let’s take a deep dive into its features and market predictions. Then, you can either purchase some tokens or swap them. Using exchanges, you can trade XEM to TRX or any other pair using the tokens you already own.




TRON Overview



The Tron project is similar to Ethereum, Solana, and other DApp-focused blockchains. In fact, it was initially launched as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, in 2017. It was successful from the beginning and, one year later, it migrated to its own blockchain. You can also compare SOL vs TRX to find out what are the differences and similarities between these blockchains.



Tron supports the creation of smart contracts, which can be used to develop any kind of DApps, such as exchanges, marketplaces, or video games. In 2019, Tron’s CEO, Justin Sun, acquired BitTorrent and launched the BTT token shortly after.



TRX Blockchain &amp; Consensus Mechanism



The Tron blockchain architecture is quite similar to others like Ethereum. However, it is differentiated by the use of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. New blocks are created every three seconds and validated by stakers known as Super Representatives (SR). Super Representatives are stakers who are voted by other network members. A new group of SRs is chosen every six hours. The mining reward is distributed between super representatives and the stakers who voted for them.




TRX DApps &amp; Smart Contracts



Tron features smart contracts, like its competitors, to foster the creation of DApps on the blockchain. The building environment is called the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM), and it is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that applications built on Ethereum can be compatible with the Tron blockchain. Ethereum is the largest smart contract-focused blockchain, so it makes sense to start with it. But in the future, the Tron team plans to make other blockchains compatible as well.



TRON Price Prediction



The TRX token has had a great market run since its inception. It launched around September 2017 and, by January 5th, it had increased by over 11,000%, when it reached its all-time high. The price quickly fell, but this initial push, along with the appropriate technical and marketing decisions, has kept the price afloat and thriving. Despite the usual surges followed by sudden drops, the price has sustained an upward trend, and it is expected to follow in the coming years.



TRX Price Forecast for 2024



TRX’s price is currently around $0.119, and market analysts predict that it will be around $0.1624 and $0.23 throughout 2024, a growth ranging between 40% and 90%. This claim isn’t unsustained because, since May 2023, the price of TRX has been climbing steadily, increasing 85% in the last 12 months. This trend isn’t unlikely to drop soon, because both the community and the developers are active on the network.



TRX Price Forecast for 2025-2030



According to market experts, the subsequent years will also follow a similar pattern, with yearly gains of around 40% and 50%.




YearAverage price2025$0.25072026$0.36312027$0.51402028$0.63042029$0.83002030$1.1750



Is TRX Worth Investing In?



Tron is definitely one of the most valuable projects in the crypto ecosystem, and the TRX token is a highly profitable investment. While the safest advice is to do your own research and only invest what you are willing to lose, we can say that TRX is one of the tokens that can be considered a good idea to invest in and expect great returns.

The Biggest Release Ever Happened! - Bitcoin Sistemi</title><link>https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-interest-rate-statement-of-the-us-federal-reserve-fed-did-not-affect-bitcoin-etfs-positively-the-biggest-release-ever-happened/</link><description>
Investors were surprisingly quick to dump U.S.-based spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday, even as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the possibility of a rate hike.
US Bitcoin ETFs Record $563 Million Outflow Despite FED Chairman Powell Rejecting Interest Rate Hike
The 11 ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $563.7 million, marking the largest outflow since the funds began trading on January 11.


According to data from Farside Investors and CoinGlass, approximately $1.2 billion has been withdrawn from ETFs since April 24, continuing a five-day losing streak.
Fidelity's FBTC led the outflows on Wednesday with $191.1 million in withdrawals.





This development could be cause for concern for bulls, as FBTC and BlackRock's IBIT steadily attracted funds in the first quarter, offsetting regular large outflows from the relatively costly Grayscale ETF (GBTC).

GBTC had the second biggest exit on Wednesday with $167.4 million, followed by ARKB with $98.1 million and IBIT with $36.9 million.


These outflows came despite Powell's clearly dovish approach, which typically favors risk assets including Bitcoin. As expected, the FED kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%.
While Powell reassured that the economy is solid enough not to require a rate cut, he also eased fears of new interest rate hikes or liquidity tightening caused by recent disappointing inflation numbers.

In the first year of the ‘crypto winter,’ pension funds – specifically Canadian pension funds – found themselves making headlines in various crypto outlets as they ended their cryptocurrency forays either before they began in earnest or after suffering major losses as companies like Celsius collapsed.
Things have quieted down since for large institutional investors – at least with regard to the crypto markets – albeit with some exceptions, such as Vanguard’s acquisition of a large stake in Bitcoin (BTC) miners.
This year, however, brought a massive change to the dynamic as in January, after years of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 9 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), seemingly opening the floodgates for crypto-wary investors to gain exposure using familiar vehicles.


BlackRock foresees massive institutional investors trading BTC ETFs
According to BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, the investment giant now expects BTC ETFs to see the coming of massive new and returning investors – Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and Endowments.
As of May 2024, BlackRock is reportedly playing the role of an educator for such institutional investors in hopes of attracting them to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and is seeing a general resurgence in interest from such entities.
At the time of publication, BlackRock operates tha second-largest Bitcoin ETF – the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which boasts approximately $17 billion in assets under management (AUM).
The financial giant is also working on closer relations with sovereign wealth funds – specifically the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund – albeit, at this stage, unrelated to the world’s premier cryptocurrency and is reportedly setting up the BlackRock Riyadh Investment Management (BRIM).
Headwinds or tailwinds?
While the approval of the ETFs certainly brought benefits for institutional Bitcoin adoption, the cryptocurrency’s continued volatility could still present a major roadblock for entities such as pension funds.
Indeed, the world’s premier cryptocurrency has been experiencing significant fluctuations in recent weeks as it has been trading in a relatively wide range between just under $57,000 and slightly over $70,000 without any guarantees about its forthcoming trend – though recent technical analysis (TA) hints at an imminent rally.
Still, the risks may ultimately not turn away major investors and traders as evidenced by two significant wealth managers  – Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas – recently disclosing substantial stakes in BTC ETFs.

                                Pi Coin Price Touched $47 Prior to Mainnet Launch Date                                The mainnet of Pi Network is likely to be launched on June 28, 2024, but before the network mainnet goes live, there is a surge in the price of its Pi Coin. According to the information, Pi Coin is trading near its IOU price of $47 on major charting platforms. However, at present Pi Coin has no value because its mainnet has not been launched yet. In such a situation, this coin cannot be sold. The team associated with Pi Network has also announced that as soon as the network reaches 15 million KYC users, the mainnet of the network will go live.Currently, Pi Network has crossed the milestone of 10 million users KYC. Since then there has been a lot of enthusiasm in the Pi community. However, in the meantime, a race has started among the users holding large amounts of Pi Coin to find ways to sell this coin. Scammers have got the opportunity to take advantage of this hustle and bustle and they are targeting users holding Pi Coin.How to determine the value of Pi Coin before the Mainnet Launch?The most important process for the network's open mainnet to go live is to complete the KYC process for its 15 million users. Pi Coin has yet to cross the figure of about 5 million users because KYC of 10 million users has been done on the network. But still, the question arises how has the price of Pi reached $47? So, here’s the answer to the question. When the mainnet goes live, nothing like Pi Coin can be considered, that is, the mined Pi Network token has no value at present. But the Pi Network is currently testnet. Hence, there are Pi Coin IOUs traded on crypto exchanges like HTX and BitMart as traders exchange promissory notes in place of real tokens. In such a situation, the entire Pi Coin market is currently based only on speculation.Users becoming victims of scams due to Pi CoinThere is a lot of buzz on social media about Pi Coin, but its users who have become holders of this coin by mining it through the app, are now looking for ways to sell this token. Pi holders are also searching on social media to sell their tokens. Scammers are taking advantage of this activity of Pi holders and there has also been an increase in fraudulent activities by creating fake websites and fake accounts with Pi Coin holders on social media platforms. In such a situation, it is essential to be cautious while buying Pi Coin. Pi holders should take special care that this Pi Coin cannot be traded until the Pi network mainnet is launched. In such a situation, do not fall into any trap related to buying Pi Coin.Also Read: Pi Day Celebration and Emerging Pi Network Popularity

BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe whose asset management arm has over $600 billion in assets under management, has gained exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) via a spot exchange-traded fund.



According to a recent 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the bank has purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as first reported by Bitcoin Magazine.



Large institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets have to, every quarter, disclose their holdings via 13F filings and after the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., these filings have been closely watched by industry sleuths.







While previous filings for the first quarter of 2024 showcased purchases by asset managers, family offices, and several smaller banks, BNP Paribas’ involvement marks a turning point even though the bank allocated a miniscule part of its holdings to the flagship cryptocurrency, acquiring around $40,000 worth of it.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Analysts anticipate that further 13F filings leading up to the May 15th deadline could reveal a broader presence of institutional investors within the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape.



As CryptoGlobe reported, recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot Bitcoin ETFs, with several experiencing record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.



ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs, which can lead to discrepancies between market prices and these funds’ NAV.

A critical look at on-chain metrics provides new insights suggesting a potential strong recovery on the horizon for Bitcoin, following the drop below $60,000. The "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" by Swissblock, which is a composite measure of various Bitcoin network health indicators, recently hit what appears to be an inflection point, signaling potential upward movement for Bitcoin's price.One of the key metrics to consider is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which currently stands at 0.96. This ratio essentially compares the market value (the current price at which Bitcoin is trading) to the realized value (the average price at which coins were last moved). A value below one typically indicates that short-term holders are holding coins at a loss, which can signal a potential bottom if other conditions align.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewWhen the STH-MVRV has dipped below one, it has typically been a precursor to a market recovery as it suggests that the selling pressure from short-term holders is waning and could indicate that sellers are exhausted. This exhaustion is further supported by the recent performance of the Bitcoin Fundamental Index, which shows a recovery from lower levels, suggesting increased network growth and investor confidence.Looking at the "Bitcoin Fundamental Index" chart, there have been significant spikes in the index correlating closely with increases in Bitcoin's price. The index itself measures several aspects of network health, including transaction volume, wallet activity and other undisclosed proprietary indicators that aim to gauge the overall sentiment and fundamental strength of Bitcoin.The current index value is nearing the higher end of its recent range. Historically, such patterns have indicated strong bullish sentiment building up, especially when combined with a low STH-MVRV.

                            Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shiba Inu-faced darling of the 2021 memecoin frenzy, has found itself shivering in the current crypto winter. Once a symbol of retail investor exuberance, DOGE has plummeted over 70% from its sky-high peak, leaving its future shrouded in uncertainty.

DOGE Feels The Crypto Frost
While Bitcoin, the heavyweight champion of the crypto world, grabs headlines with its recent wobble, the impact on memecoins like DOGE has been brutal. Unlike Bitcoin’s divided analyst opinions, the sentiment surrounding DOGE is decidedly bearish.
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.132, down 5.4% up the last 24 hours but sustained a 20% loss in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.

Is DOGE A Canary In The Crypto Coal Mine?
Some analysts believe DOGE’s struggles are a canary in the coal mine for the entire crypto market. They said if even a historically high-flying memecoin like Dogecoin can’t hold onto gains, it raises serious concerns about risk appetite in the crypto space in general.

Whales Accumulating DOGE: A Glimmer Of Hope?
However, a glimmer of hope flickers for the dethroned meme king. On-chain data suggests an increase in large wallet purchases of DOGE, hinting at potential accumulation by wealthy investors. This “contrarian” behavior could be a sign that some whales are using Coinglass or similar platforms to track Dogecoin derivatives and believe the coin is undervalued and ripe for a comeback.

Coinglass, a popular cryptocurrency data provider, offers insights into factors that might be influencing the whales’ decisions. By analyzing metrics like open interest, funding rates, and liquidations on Coinglass, these investors might see an opportunity to buy DOGE at a discount.

In a similar development, Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, has reported that a DOGE whale arranged two large transactions in a single day. Some 150,000,000 Dogecoins were transferred in the first transaction, and an additional 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred in the second, for a total of almost 226 million DOGE. At the time, the meme cryptocurrency was worth around $40 million in fiat money.

Can Dogecoin Thaw The Crypto Winter?
The coming weeks will be critical for DOGE. The return of positive social media sentiment, coupled with continued accumulation by whales who might be strategically using Coinglass for market analysis, could be the spark that reignites the DOGE rally. However, if the broader market weakness persists, DOGE’s summer might be spent shivering in the doghouse.

CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer recently shared his take on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks from the Fed's two-day meeting that just ended.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that raising interest rates was unlikely to be the Fed's next action. Officials would need to see compelling evidence that the policy is not tight enough to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Cramer told investors to believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he hinted on Wednesday that a rate hike was improbable, despite persistent inflation.Although Powell's comments temporarily calmed the markets, Cramer indicated that investors might become concerned again as job data will be announced on Friday. The numbers could provide more information about whether the economy is slowing or accelerating.Even though Powell stopped short of signaling rate cuts were likely this year or that rates were at a peak, Cramer said that the Fed chief had managed to take "the dreaded rate hike scenario off the table." Given Cramer's history of making predictions that turn out contrary, particularly in the crypto market, this raises the question of the implications of the recent developments on the macro front for cryptocurrencies. Implications for cryptocurrenciesHistorically, Bitcoin has had four April declines in the last decade, three of which foreshadowed May losses of 18% on average, according to Bloomberg data.Still, if inflation pressures ease and markets resume bets on a much looser Fed stance, cryptocurrencies and other speculative assets may see some respite.The Fed has maintained interest rates steadily in the 5.25%-5.5% range for nearly nine months, and Powell's statements did not imply that the central bank is inclined to drop rates anytime soon.It is unusual for interest rates to hold steady for more than a year. That said, the lagging impact of higher-for-longer rates remains a concern for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This could be a tail risk that might keep bulls at bay.
